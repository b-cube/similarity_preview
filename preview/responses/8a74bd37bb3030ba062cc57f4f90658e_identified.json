Two stations are visited about once a month: Kahe Point (Station 1:  21.34N, 158.27W) and Station ALOHA (Station 2: 22.75N, 158W).  Various other stations are made intermittently in support of similar research objectives or mooring deployments.  Samples of water column chemical analyses were collected mostly in the upper 1000m using Niskin bottles mounted on a rosette. The strategy was to sample at density horizons within the main thermocline at pressure horizons above and below this region (i.e., &lt;150 dbar and &gt;2000 dbar).  Care was applied to ensure the highest possible accuracy and precision.       </abstract>       <purpose>         The objective of the physical component of HOT is to describe and understand the ocean climate and variability at a deep-water site in the North Pacific subtropical gyre near Hawaii. This requires a long time series of physical oceanographic variables, including water mass properties and currents, supporting and complementing the objectives of the biogeochemical component of HOT.       </purpose>       <supplinf>         NOAASupplemental: Entry_ID: Unknown Sensor_Name: Niskin bottles Source_Name: ship;

The field phase of these programs has ended, but support from the Ocean Sciences Division of NSF has enabled continuation of our basic HOT measurement program until mid-2001. The PO component contributes to the objectives of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Programme by providing information on interannual to decadal variability of the North Pacific Ocean.

During transit from Honolulu to the time-series station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment) one weight test is done to between 700 and 1000 m at station 1 off Kahe Point (16 km offshore from the western tip of Oahu, 21 20.6&apos; N, 158 16.4&apos; W, 1500 m water depth). Following the successful winch test, a CTD/rosette cast to 1000 m is conducted. This cast serves as a &quot;shakedown&quot; for the remainder of the cruise, and the functioning of the components of the CTD/rosette system as well as coordination between winch, deck and console operators can be tested. The training of new personnel in activities such as taking meteorological observations, and sampling salinities is also done in this station. The data taken at Kahe Point (station 1) represent an additional time-series of water properties at a near-shore site.  Upon arrival at ALOHA (station 2), operations commence with a deep cast (maximum depth approximately 4750 m), 36-hour burst sampling3 of the upper 1000 m at the same location, plus CTD casts to support ancillary JGOFS work of about an extra 12 hours duration. Time permitting, the last CTD cast of the cruise will be a deep cast. On occasion, one cast will be done at station 3 (40 miles north of ALOHA at 23 25&apos; N, 158 W).  The second and following casts at station ALOHA are sampled to at least 1000 m depth. Cast 2 is called a &quot;density cast&quot; because water samples are taken at a number of specified density values ranging from [sigma-theta]= 27.37 to the surface with the intent to resolve the profiles of salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients in potential density coordinates Depths sampled during the following casts within the 36-hour burst sampling period are chosen both by the JGOFS group and the WOCE team, who have to ensure that at least one water sample each is taken within the mixed layer, the shallow salinity maximum, the intermediate salinity minimum and the deepest position of the rosette for calibration of the CTD conductivity sensor. If oxygen bottles will be taken from the cast, then the sampling should include at least the mixed layer, oxygen maximum, oxygen minimum and the deepest rosette position for calibration of the CTD oxygen sensor. The second deep cast of the cruise (if there is one) should include sampling of oxygen bottles in at least seven levels appropriate for calibration of the CTD oxygen sensor, i.e. in the oxycline and two more levels below the oxygen minimum, in addition to the four levels mentioned before.  Water samples are collected during HOT cruises using a 24 place rosette. Samples of salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate and silicate are regularly taken from both shallow and deep water casts. Salinity samples are taken back to the University of Hawaii where they are measured using an Autosal salinometer . Phosphate, nitrate and silicate samples are also measured at the University of Hawaii while oxygen measurements are conducted aboard ship during the cruises.  The primary objective of the HOT program is to assess variability in the central Pacific Ocean on annual and interannual time scales. One of our most important concerns, therefore, is to ensure that the highest possible precision and accuracy is consistently maintained for all water column chemical measurements. In order to achieve the highest possible data quality, we have instituted a quality-assurance/quality-control program, and have attempted to collect all ancillary information necessary to ensure that our data are not biased by sampling artifacts.  Because sampling is over 36 hours, one can average out the effects short-term changes of the depth of density surfaces and the magnitude of hydrographic and nutrient variables (inertial, tidal, and shorter periods).         </procdesc>         <srcused>           1990 Chiswell, S., E.
