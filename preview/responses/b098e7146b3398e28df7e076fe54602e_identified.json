The strata were created from the multivariate analysis of 75 environmental variables, including climatic data, topographic data, human geographical features and geology data.  The Land Classification has provided a stratification for successive ecological surveys (the Countryside Survey of Great Britain), the results of which have characterised the classes in terms of botanical, zoological and landscape features.  Additionally, the Land Classification can be used to stratify a wide range of ecological and biogeographical surveys to improve the efficiency of collection, analysis and presentation of information derived from a sample.  There are three versions of the Classification available. 1. The 1990 version containing 32 classes, which was the first to classify all 240,000km squares in Great Britain (building on an earlier 1978 version based on a sample of squares only).  2. A 1998 version, when the Land Classification was adjusted to 40 classes as a consequence of the need to provide National Estimates (from Countryside Survey 2000) for habitats for Scotland in addition to GB as a whole. 3. In 2007, the Land Classification was adjusted once again, to 45 classes, as a consequence of the need to provide Wales-only estimates in addition to those for Scotland and GB as a whole (from Countryside Survey 2007).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Bio-geographical regions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land classification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ITE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Institute of Terrestrial Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-05T13:34:37Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/571a676f-6c32-489b-b7ec-18dcc617a9f1\">     <title>UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/571a676f-6c32-489b-b7ec-18dcc617a9f1</link>     <description>This is a series of datasets available from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). The UKBMS comprises a suite of surveys carried out each year across the UK that generate data on butterfly abundance. The UKBMS started in 1976 (few sites from 1973) with thirty-six sites increasing to over a thousand by 2010. On the majority of these sites, recorders walk a fixed route (divided into up to 15 sections) at their site every week from 1st April to 29th September (total of 26 weeks), each year, counting butterflies within defined limits (5m box) when weather meets certain criteria. On some sites different survey techniques are employed to assess the abundance of species. These techniques include timed counts and larval web surveys in fixed areas. Weather data is recorded at the time of the count and habitat data is available for most transects. The surveys are undertaken by volunteers and other recorders, who contribute their data free of charge. The scheme is operated as a partnership between the Centre For Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC), and is jointly sponsored by a multi-agency consortium of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Natural Environment Research Council (through CEH), BC, Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Countryside Council for Wales, Natural England, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage. UKBMS data is widely used for research; a list of publications as well as downloadable PDF copies of past Annual Reports is made available via the UKBMS website. Datasets currently available for download are yearly calculations of species trends and collated indices of abundance, as well as yearly updated site data. Access to the full dataset should be requested directly from the UKBMS.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-06T09:13:09Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d</link>     <description>Collated indices are a relative measure of butterfly abundance across monitored sites in the UK, calculated from data collected by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Collated indices are calculated annually for each individual butterfly species that has been recorded on five or more sites in that year. Based on this criterion collated indices have been calculated for the entire UKBMS time series from 1976 to the current year for the majority of species. For some rarer species the time series starts in a later year due to lack of data. Collated indices are calculated using a statistical model that accounts for missing data. The number of sites for each species ranges from 5 to several hundred and varies from year to year. Since 2008 more than 1,000 sites have been monitored across the UK each year. Collated indices are calculated so that we can determine how butterfly populations are changing over time across the UK. This data can be used, for example, to determine where to target conservation efforts and to measure the condition of the UK countryside. Butterflies are recognised as important indicators of biodiversity and environmental change (e.g. as official UK Biodiversity Indicators), and have been used in numerous research studies to understand the impacts of changes in climate and the extent and condition of habitats. Although the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of the Collated indices, the collection of the data used in their creation is ultimately reliant on a large volunteer community. The UKBMS is funded by a consortium of organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-10-27T14:27:51Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/15b65cf5-d54a-43ff-9cd9-7483bea36ab3\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: species trends 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/15b65cf5-d54a-43ff-9cd9-7483bea36ab3</link>     <description>This dataset provides linear trends, over varying time periods, for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) Collated Indices of individual butterfly species across the UK. The main statistical values derived from a linear regression (slope, standard error, P-value) are presented for the entire time series for each species (1976 to 2013), for the last 20 years, and for the last decade. In addition a trend class, based on slope direction and its significance, and a percentage change for that time period are provided to describe the statistical trends. These trend data are provided for 59 UK butterfly species. Trends across different time series allow us to determine the long and short-term trends for individual species. This is enables us to focus conservation and research and also to assess species responses to conservation already in place. The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of this trend datasets. The collection of the underlying UKBMS data is reliant on a large volunteer community.

Data includes the location within the UK, the length and width of the line transect on each site, and how long the transect has been monitored. The UKBMS started in 1976 with fewer than 50 sites. The number of sites monitored each year has increased to over a thousand since 2008. There is turnover in sites monitored each year and details of the first and last year in which each site was surveyed are given. The majority of site data is provided by recorders at the time a transect is created. The majority of these recorders are volunteers.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 508 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths per 1km square for 7 different feature categories within 45 different land class types, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-10-16T08:08:40Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ebbd1ba0-4497-4c80-891a-34ef3b8989cd\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1990 estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ebbd1ba0-4497-4c80-891a-34ef3b8989cd</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1990.

The dataset is part of a series of data products produced by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology known as LCM2007.  LCM2007 is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom. The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors and also incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets.  LCM2007 was classified using a nomenclature corresponding to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompasses the entire range of UK habitats. In addition, it recorded further detail where possible.  The series of LCM2007 products includes vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LCM2007</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-07-23T12:28:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
