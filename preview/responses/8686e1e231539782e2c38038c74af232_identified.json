The issue is that as there are tables containing URIs in  several columns, those tables are very large and do not fit on a page  while printing.

The issue is that multicast bindings, for example, may be prohibited if  there is only one single ultimate receiver.  Currently, Part 1 specifies there can only be ONE ultimate receiver (THE  ultimate receiver). An earlier version of Part 1 used to allow multiple  receivers (AN ultimate receiver), as per the resolution to issue 103 [2].  It appears that when the resolution to issue 103 was implemented, not  all occurences of \"THE\" were changes to \"AN\", and that an (unfortunate)  editorial sanity check later replaced all instances of \"AN\" to \"THE\",  instead of the contrary.  We have two options at this stage:  1) Go with whatever is in Part 1 today, considering that we are too late  in the Recommendation process; or  2) Reimplement the resolution to 103 (i.e. s/THE/AN/).  I have a preference for option 2) above and consider that this is an  editorial change only. However, I think we should first investigate  whether this change is likely to (severely) impact current  implementations. I don't think so, but at the same time I don't want to  take the risk of delaying publication. </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jun/0005.html\">email</a>] </description>   <proposal>   </proposal>   <resolution>   <pre> The working group discussed the issue and decided to close it with no action  partly due to being very late in the process but mainly because there was no desire amongst the WG to change the status quo.   </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jun/0006.html\">email</a>]   </resolution> </issue>  <issue>   <issue-num>433</issue-num>   <title>Multiple env:NotUnderstood   </title>   <locus>spec-part0</locus>   <requirement>n/a</requirement>   <priority>Design</priority>   <topic>meta</topic>   <status>Closed</status>   <Accepted />    <originator><a href=\"mailto:Tony.Graham@Sun.COM\">Tony Graham</a></originator>   <responsible></responsible>   <description>   <pre> The second paragraph of Section 5.4.8, SOAP mustUnderstand Faults, of the SOAP Version 1.2 Part 1 PR states:     A SOAP node MAY generate a SOAP fault for any one or more SOAP    header blocks that were not understood in a SOAP message.

Thank you for noting this discrepancy. The WG has  resolved this with the following amendments to the Primer.  1. In example 9, replace the first line with: POST /Reservations HTTP/1.1  2. Rewrite the 1st para following example 9 (>>deletions&lt;&lt;, &lt;&lt;additions>>) thus:  \"Example 9 shows an RPC request directed at >>a specific reservation at &lt;&lt; the travel  service application. The SOAP message is sent in the body of a HTTP POST method  directed at the URI identifying the >>specific reservation&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;\"Reservations\" resource on the server travelcompany.example.org>>. When using HTTP, the request URI indicates  the resource to which the invocation is \"posted\". Other than &lt;&lt;requiring that>> it be a  valid URI, SOAP places no formal restriction on the form of the request URI (see [RFC 2396]  for more information on URIs). However, one of the principles of the Web architecture is  that all important resources be identified by URIs. This implies that most well-architected  SOAP services will be embodied as a large number of resources, each with its own URI. Indeed,  many such resources are likely to be created dynamically during the operation of a service,  such as, for instance, the specific travel reservation shown in the example. So, a  well-architected travel service application >>will&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;should>> have different  URIs for each reservation, and SOAP requests to retrieve or manipulate those reservations  will be directed at their URIs, and not at a single monolithic \"reservations\" URI, &lt;&lt;as shown in Example 9>>.&lt;&lt; Example 13 in section 4.1.3 shows the preferred way to address resources such as a particular travel reservation. Therefore, we defer until section 4.1.3  further discussion of Web architecture compatible SOAP/HTTP usage.>>\"  3. Delete the 2nd para following Example 9 (it will be moved and merged into section 4.1.3,  see item 5 below).  4. Rewrite the 1st para **before** Example 13 (>>deletions&lt;&lt;, &lt;&lt;additions>>) thus:  \"Example 13 is the same as that in Example 9, except that the &lt;&lt;HTTP>> Request-URI has been  modified to include the reservation code, which serves to identify the resource (the reservation  in question, which is being confirmed and paid for) >>, while the other parameters in the RPC,  such as the creditCard number are ancillary data to be processed by the resource. Note, however,  that all the resource-identifying elements have been retained as in Example 9 in their encoded  form in the SOAP env:Body element&lt;&lt; .   5. Add a **new** paragraph just **after** Example 13 with the following text (modified deleted text  from item 3 above):  \"In Example 13, the resource to be manipulated is identified by two things: the first is that it  is a reservation (part of the method name), and the second is the specific instance of a reservation  (which is the value of the parameter code to the method). The remainder of the parameters in the RPC  such as the creditCard number are not resource-identifying, but are ancillary data to be processed  by the resource. It is the recommendation of [SOAP Part2] that resources that may be accessed by  SOAP-based RPCs should, where practical, place any such resource-identifying information as a part  of the URI identifying the target of the RPC. It should be noted, however, that [SOAP Part2] does  not offer any algorithm to do so. Such algorithms may be developed in future. Note, however, that  all the resource-identifying elements have been retained as in Example 9 in their encoded form in  the SOAP env:Body element.\"   </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jun/0001.html\">email</a>]  </resolution> </issue>   <!-- issue 429 is on first issues list (Working Drafts) about PASWA -->  <issue>   <issue-num>428</issue-num>   <title>Content-free Header and Body elements   </title>   <locus>spec</locus>   <requirement>n/a</requirement>   <priority>Design</priority>   <topic>meta</topic>   <status>Closed</status>  <Accepted />    <originator><a href=\"mailto:rsalz@datapower.com\">Rich Salz</a></originator>   <responsible></responsible>   <description>   <pre> Are the following messages semantically equivalent (namespace  declarations omitted for brevity)?     &lt;S:Envelope&gt;         &lt;S:Header&gt;&lt;/S:Header&gt;  &lt;S:Body&gt;&lt;tns:foo/&gt;&lt;/S:Body&gt;     &lt;/S:Envelope&gt; and     &lt;S:Envelope&gt;  &lt;S:Body&gt;&lt;tns:foo/&gt;&lt;/S:Body&gt;     &lt;/S:Envelope&gt;  In other words, if there are no headers, are message processors allowed  to insert/delete an empty Header element?

In Example 4, the xml declaration is &lt;?xml version='1.0' ?&gt; without any  encoding attribute, therefore the value of encoding defaults to utf-8.

In other words, SOAP messages cannot contain comments in either the  prolog or epilog of a document. This was inferrable from the previous  December 2002 working draft, but was stated in much less obvious  language.  If I had to guess, I'd say this is an attempt to allow multiple SOAP  messages to be stuffed into a single file or stream with clear  boundaries between them. Whether that's a good idea or not, I don't  think such a major change should be tossed out without further  analysis and debate.

SOAP messages can still be processed using standard XML parsers.  3.      There are any number of other things one could put in an XML Infoset that would cause that Infoset to be illegal per the SOAP specification. For example, the [document element] having a [local name] property with a value other than 'Envelope'.  4.
