If the relationship between teaching and learning were causal, i. e. if students always mastered the intended learning outcomes of a particular sequence of instruction, assessment would be superfluous. Experience and research suggest this is not the case: what is learnt can often be quite different from what is taught. Formative assessment is motivated by a concern with the elicitation of relevant information about student understanding and / or achievement, its interpretation and an exploration of how it can lead to actions that result in better learning. In the context of a policy drive towards technology-enhanced approaches to teaching and learning, the question of the role of digital technologies is key and it is the latter on which this project particularly focuses. The project and its deliverables have been informed by recent and relevant literature, in particular recent work by Black andIn this work, they put forward a framework which suggests that assessment for learning their term for formative assessment can be conceptualised as consisting of a number of aspects and five keystrategies. The key aspects revolve around the where the learner is going, where the learner is right now and how she can get there and examines the role played by the teacher, peers and the learner.

The guide draws on recent JISC reports and case studies from different contexts and modes of learning to explore the relationship between technology-enhanced assessment and feedback practices and meaningful, well-supported learning experiences.  Effective Assessment in a Digital Age complements Effective Practice in a Digital Age, the 2009 JISC guide to learning and teaching with technology, and Effective practice with e-Assessment (JISC 2007) by focusing on the potential enhancement to assessment and feedback practices offered by both purpose-designed and more familiar technologies. </swrc:abstract><swrc:author><rdf:Seq><rdf:_1><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Sarah Davies\"/></rdf:_1></rdf:Seq></swrc:author></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/2a2c437696e5e62c3538f83624d01ae11/yish\"><owl:sameAs rdf:resource=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/uri/bibtex/2a2c437696e5e62c3538f83624d01ae11/yish\"/><rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#TechnicalReport\"/><owl:sameAs rdf:resource=\"http://www.jisc.org.uk/media/documents/programmes/usersandinnovation/planet%20final%20report.pdf\"/><swrc:date>Mon Dec 21 01:16:08 CET 2009</swrc:date><swrc:institution><swrc:Organization swrc:name=\"JISC\"/></swrc:institution><swrc:title>Planet: Pattern Language Network for Web 2.0 in Learning</swrc:title><swrc:year>2009</swrc:year><swrc:keywords>JISC designpatterns eLPBookMor elp-feasst final haifa-edtech my patternlanguagenetwork patterns polonsky project report </swrc:keywords><swrc:abstract>The Planet (Pattern Language Network for Web 2.0 in Learning) project aimed to develop and demonstrate an effective community-based mechanism for capturing and sharing successful practice, based on the pattern approach. A pattern describes an effective solution to a recurrent problem embedded in a specific context and is characterised by being drawn from successful practice rather than from theory. Patterns are easy and intuitive to use, so supporting transfer of practice to new contexts. However, the process of eliciting and capturing patterns from authentic practice is not trivial and is rarely an inclusive community-based activity. It is this problem that Planet has sought to address.</swrc:abstract><swrc:author><rdf:Seq><rdf:_1><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Janet Finlay\"/></rdf:_1><rdf:_2><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"John Gray\"/></rdf:_2><rdf:_3><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Isobel Falconer\"/></rdf:_3><rdf:_4><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Jim Hensman\"/></rdf:_4><rdf:_5><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Yishay Mor\"/></rdf:_5><rdf:_6><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Steven Warburton\"/></rdf:_6></rdf:Seq></swrc:author></rdf:Description><rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/282066d204effbb376f5104d6eec5481d/yish\"><owl:sameAs rdf:resource=\"http://www.bibsonomy.org/uri/bibtex/282066d204effbb376f5104d6eec5481d/yish\"/><rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http://swrc.ontoware.org/ontology#TechnicalReport\"/><owl:sameAs rdf:resource=\"http://ie-repository.jisc.ac.uk/259/\"/><swrc:date>Tue Feb 03 13:44:45 CET 2009</swrc:date><swrc:title>Report of the Subject and Institutional Repositories Interactions Study</swrc:title><swrc:year>2008</swrc:year><swrc:keywords>JISC report repositories review </swrc:keywords><swrc:abstract>This report was commissioned by JISC to produce a set of practical recommendations for steps that can be taken to improve the interactions between institutional and subject repositories in the UK.

We reviewed the history of the development of repositories in the UK, and analysed the current repository landscape, primarily through seeking the views of key stakeholders: repository managers, funders and other parties involved or interested in repository development. Metrical data were gathered from published sources and by means of a survey of institutional repository managers.</swrc:abstract><swrc:author><rdf:Seq><rdf:_1><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Catherine Jones\"/></rdf:_1><rdf:_2><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Robert Darby\"/></rdf:_2><rdf:_3><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Linda Gilbert\"/></rdf:_3><rdf:_4><swrc:Person swrc:name=\"Simon Lambert\"/></rdf:_4></rdf:Seq></swrc:author></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>",
