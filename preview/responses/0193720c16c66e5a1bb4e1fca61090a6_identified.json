Technology is evolving rapidly and new tools and techniques are being created and enhanced to enable community members to do more individually and collaboratively. Workforce development opportunities can assist community members in their efforts to improve their capabilities and knowledge. A panel will describe workforce development opportunities that are available for the Earth science community and engage in a discussion with the audience on how the EarthCube community can improve by leveraging these opportunities.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>",
