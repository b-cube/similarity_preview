RIOXX 2.0 is a significantly improved metadata application profile thanks to the level and quality of input we have received from the community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We would also like to thank Jisc for having provided funding and support for the crucial early stages in the development of the RIOXX application profile.&lt;/p&gt; </content>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Release Candidate 2 Released For Comment</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/2014/12/04/release-candidate-2-released-for-comment/\"/>     <id>http://www.rioxx.net/2014/12/04/release-candidate-2-released-for-comment/</id>     <published>2014-12-04T09:34:55+00:00</published>     <updated>2014-12-09T14:35:21+00:00</updated>     <author>       <name>Paul Walk</name>     </author>     <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Following further public consultation and discussion with stakeholders, we have just released  &lt;a href=\"/v2-0-rc-2\"&gt;RIOXX 2.0 Release Candidate 2&lt;/a&gt; for comment.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The changes from RIOXX 2.0 Beta 1 are detailed in the &lt;a href=\"/release_notes\"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;, but the most significant change is that we have added a recommendation to use &lt;a href=\"http://isni.org\"&gt;ISNI&lt;/a&gt; identifiers for for organisations when named as authors, contributors or funders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We think RIOXX 2.0 is very close to being ready for its final release and are aiming for a release date of 2015-01-09.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"nisos-access-and-license-indicators-guidelines\"&gt;NISO's Access and License Indicators guidelines&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RIOXX is required, following Jisc's &lt;a href=\"http://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20140701123059/http://v4oa.net/\"&gt;V4OA process&lt;/a&gt;, to use two properties from the NISO's &lt;a href=\"http://www.niso.org/workrooms/ali/\"&gt;Access and License Indicators&lt;/a&gt; guidelines: 'license_ref' and 'free_to_read'. While the guidelines are still in a final review process, we have been assured that there will be no significant changes to these.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 'license_ref' property is the most important of these - it's &lt;em&gt;mandatory&lt;/em&gt; in a RIOXX record, while 'free_to_read' is optional.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"the-licenseref-property\"&gt;The license_ref property&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This property, which is mandatory for a RIOXX record requires an HTTP URI and a date, where the HTTP URI identifies a particular license. The ideal case is the use of one of the licenses which are acceptable to RCUK &amp;amp; HEFCE, such as &lt;a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0\"&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is recognised that there will, however, be cases where either the license is not known, or where no appropriate HTTP URI has been established to identify the license.  We did contemplate making 'license_ref' an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; property, but decided against this, on the grounds that this would undermine the drive towards clearer licensing of open access materials. Instead, we have taken steps which maintain the integrity of the mechanism supported by the use of the 'license_ref' property, while allowing repository managers to supply information in a valid RIOXX record.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The absence of a license means that the default copyright position of \"All Rights Reserved\" applies. For convenience, we have 'minted' the HTTP URI '&lt;a href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/all-rights-reserved\"&gt;http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/all-rights-reserved&lt;/a&gt;' for such situations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A particular, common case for repositories will be where an item is held in the repository under &lt;em&gt;embargo&lt;/em&gt;. In such cases, the item is not licensed for use, and the default copyright position of \"All Rights Reserved\" applies. Again, for convenience, we have minted an HTTP URI, '&lt;a href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/under-embargo-all-rights-reserved\"&gt;http://www.rioxx.net/licenses/under-embargo-all-rights-reserved&lt;/a&gt;', for embargoed items.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In neither of these cases are we creating some new license expression, but we are allowing the mechanism which requires explicit URIs to function, and are making the absence of a license &lt;em&gt;explicit&lt;/em&gt;, rather than &lt;em&gt;inferred&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond this, the license entered here will be that demanded by the funder, the publisher or the owner of the repository (or even the author), depending on the circumstances (e.g. green/gold).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We welcome comment (please use the comments facility on this blog) on this, or on any aspect of RIOXX 2.0 RC 2.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: this post has been slightly edited to make clear that the recommendation to use ISNI to identify authors and contributors applies only where the author or contributor is an organisation rather than a person. ORCID remains the recommended identifier scheme for individual people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>RIOXX 2.0 beta 1 released for comment</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/2014/06/27/rioxx-2-0-beta-1-released-for-comment/\"/>     <id>http://www.rioxx.net/2014/06/27/rioxx-2-0-beta-1-released-for-comment/</id>     <published>2014-06-27T16:30:31+01:00</published>     <updated>2014-07-11T10:14:50+01:00</updated>     <author>       <name>Paul Walk</name>     </author>     <content type=\"html\">&lt;h1 id=\"update\"&gt;Update:&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;This consultation will be closed for comments at 17:00 BST on Wednesday 16th July&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are pleased to release a &lt;a href=\"/v2-0-beta-1\"&gt;beta version of RIOXX 2.0&lt;/a&gt; for public comment. RIOXX 2.0 has been developed by &lt;a href=\"http://www.edina.ac.uk\"&gt;EDINA&lt;/a&gt; and Chygrove Ltd, with significant input from &lt;a href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk\"&gt;RCUK&lt;/a&gt;. This work is endorsed by &lt;a href=\"http://www.rcuk.ac.uk\"&gt;RCUK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk\"&gt;HEFCE&lt;/a&gt; and has been funded and facilitated by &lt;a href=\"http://www.jisc.ac.uk\"&gt;Jisc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"background\"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RIOXX 1 was released in April 2013 to support institutional repositories in complying with open access reporting mandates from RCUK. Repository managers were facing a very short period of time in which to implement RIOXX. Consequently, RIOXX contained a number of compromises designed to minimise the amount of necessary software development and repository re-configuration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Changes in the policy landscape have created a 'window of opportunity': we believe there is now sufficient time for the software development and repository reconfiguration necessary to implement a more complete version of RIOXX.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"rioxx-20\"&gt;RIOXX 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"/contact\"&gt;RIOXX Team&lt;/a&gt; has worked closely with RCUK and HEFCE, to create a new version of the RIOXX application profile. Valid RIOXX 2.0 records are designed to satisfy the open access reporting requirements of RCUK and the REF 2020 reporting requirements of HEFCE. We expect RCUK to align its schedule for reporting with that of HEFCE. This means that repositories will have until April 2016 to reconfigure their repositories to support RIOXX 2.0, should they wish to use RIOXX to meet these funders' reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;RIOXX 2.0 is specifically focussed on describing open access &lt;em&gt;publications&lt;/em&gt;. It allows linking to other open access outputs types (such as research data sets for example), but does not describe these.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"vocabularies-for-open-access-v4oa\"&gt;Vocabularies for Open Access (V4OA)&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The RIOXX Team undertook to include the recommendations of the  &lt;a href=\"http://www.v4oa.net\"&gt;V4OA&lt;/a&gt; process. RIOXX 2.0 introduces several elements and vocabularies which have been recommended by V4OA.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"interoperability\"&gt;Interoperability&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The RIOXX Team is collaborating with OpenAIRE to ensure that there is a degree of interoperability with the &lt;a href=\"https://guidelines.openaire.eu/wiki/OpenAIRE_Guidelines:_For_Literature_repositories\"&gt;OpenAIRE Guidelines For Literature Repositories (version 3.0)&lt;/a&gt;. This interoperability is in one direction only: we undertake to ensure that a valid OpenAIRE 3.0 metadata record can be produced from a valid RIOXX 2.0 metadata record. We have invited OpenAIRE to verify interoperability and will be working closely with them in the next few weeks to test this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"software-plugin-development-and-support\"&gt;Software (plugin) development and support&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The RIOXX Team has had preliminary discussions with some repository system suppliers. Jisc plans to commission the development of plugins to support RIOXX 2.0 on the more popular repository platforms in use in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jisc also plans to fund a &lt;em&gt;repository support project&lt;/em&gt;  which will have as part of its remit the support of repository managers in implementing RIOXX 2.0&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"public-review\"&gt;Public review&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/v2-0-beta-1\"&gt;RIOXX 2.0 (beta 1)&lt;/a&gt; is now available for public review. We anticipate making at least one further revision following your feedback - this can be offered either publicly in the comments on this blog post (preferred) or more privately to the rioxx admin email address: &lt;a href=\"&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#120;&amp;#120;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;\"&gt;&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#120;&amp;#120;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt; (also OK).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We look forward to your comments!&lt;/p&gt;  </content>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Developing a RIOXX profile in CERIF</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/2013/05/07/developing-a-rioxx-profile-in-cerif/\"/>     <id>http://www.rioxx.net/2013/05/07/developing-a-rioxx-profile-in-cerif/</id>     <published>2013-05-07T01:00:00+01:00</published>     <updated>2014-06-27T17:18:30+01:00</updated>     <author>       <name>Paul Walk</name>     </author>     <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;I have been working with Brigitte J\\ufffd\\ufffdrg of the &lt;a href=\"http://cerifsupport.org\"&gt;CERIF Support Project&lt;/a&gt; to consider how the RIOXX application profile might be expressed in CERIF. CERIF has become the &lt;em&gt;de-facto&lt;/em&gt; standard for data exchange between Current Research Information Systems (CRIS), particularly in Europe. In the spirit of working as openly as possible, we are sharing our thinking about this as we go.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One particularly interesting aspect of this has how CERIF might handle the way in which we express cardinality constraints in the RIOXX profile (e.g. 'zero or one', 'one or more' etc.). This should have wider applicability, and might be an example of how the development of CERIF can be informed by solutions developed in other frameworks such as the Dublin Core (which underpins the current RIOXX application profile).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brigitte has written up a &lt;a href=\"http://www.cerifsupport.org/2013/05/05/rioxx-in-cerif/\"&gt;commentary and a draft of how this might be done&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Please do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; consider this to be an official or supported CERIF expression of RIOXX.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>RIOXX version 1.0 released</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/2013/04/18/rioxx-version-1-0-released/\"/>     <id>http://www.rioxx.net/2013/04/18/rioxx-version-1-0-released/</id>     <published>2013-04-18T01:00:00+01:00</published>     <updated>2014-06-27T17:18:30+01:00</updated>     <author>       <name>Paul Walk</name>     </author>     <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The RIOXX team are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0 of the RIOXX &lt;a href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/metadata-guidelines/\"&gt;Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/v1-0/\"&gt;Application Profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To support the development of related software, &lt;a href=\"http://docs.rioxx.net/schema/v1.0/rioxx.xsd\"&gt;an XML schema (XSD) has also been published&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Please feel free to comment on any of this work by emailing the RIOXX team at &lt;a href=\"&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#120;&amp;#120;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;\"&gt;&amp;#097;&amp;#100;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#105;&amp;#111;&amp;#120;&amp;#120;&amp;#046;&amp;#110;&amp;#101;&amp;#116;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </content>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>RIOXX - minor updates to the application profile and a draft XSD schema</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://www.rioxx.net/2013/04/03/rioxx-minor-updates-to-the-application-profile-and-a-draft-xsd-schema/\"/>     <id>http://www.rioxx.net/2013/04/03/rioxx-minor-updates-to-the-application-profile-and-a-draft-xsd-schema/</id>     <published>2013-04-03T01:00:00+01:00</published>     <updated>2014-06-27T17:18:30+01:00</updated>     <author>       <name>Paul Walk</name>     </author>     <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;A minor update to the RIOXX application profile (v0.91) has been published, and a draft XSD schema intended for validation of RIOXX records has been made available.

Where is the list from and who will maintain it going forward?  ----  ##### Comment by James Toon on 2013/03/27 at 10:36  On the funder ID requirement rioxxterms.project.id I have a little concern over the need to have the exact award reference because we have many cases here where the ID held on our system may have a different suffix i.e. ST/K001234/1 might actually be ST/K001234/2 in our system because the PI might have transferred in from another institution etc... hence we wouldn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt be able to comply.  I was also going to ask much the same thing as Anna \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd also about whether the funding list will be maintained and/or could be extended to include former names (previously known as, merged with etc) plus some date info to add to the former categories.  BTW \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd I also note that the url in the document is http://docs.rioxx.net.funders and should be http://docs.rioxx.net/funders  ----  ##### Comment by [Petr Knoth](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/petr/) on 2013/03/28 at 22:47  Hi Paul,  I had a look on the 0.9 draft of the RIOXX specification and have two questions/suggestions.  1) dc:rights. I find it interesting that you decided not to follow the OpenAire guidelines (their vocabulary), but in my view your recommendation looks more descriptive (and logical). Perhaps this non-compliance with OpenAire could be solved by mapping your (CreativeCommons) vocabulary to the OpenAire vocabulary (which I imagine can be done easily).  2) dc:identifier  The RIOXX guidelines say about the dc:identifier field the following:  &gt; dc:identifier  &gt; cardinality: Exactly one  &gt; This field MUST contain a globally unique and persistent identifier for the resource being described. The identifier SHOULD be an HTTP URI that can be de-referenced (and is, thus, actionable). The purpose of this field is to allow access to the resource, therefore it is RECOMMENDED that this identifier should point to the actual resource being described by the RIOXX record (typically a PDF file), rather than to an intermediary resource such as a repository web page. This resource SHOULD be a version of the resource held in the local repository.  I really like that RIOXX goes quite far in this, but think it can go even a bit further. A few month ago, I drafted a paper - [From Open Access Metadata to Open Access Content](http://core-project.kmi.open.ac.uk/files/oa-metadata-to-oa-content.pdf) in which I was looking at how repositories reference full-texts. I came up with two principles/recommendations that would, I believe, really help content aggregators. I think they are already quite consistent with the approach you are proposing.   The first principle, which you find on page 3 of the paper, says:  &gt; Open repositories should always establish a link from the metadata record to the item the metadata record describes using a de-referencable identifier pointing to the version held in the repository. The de-referencable identifier should be provided in the appropriate metadata element in the used metadata format (i.e. dc:identifier in the case of Dublin Core).  &gt; The implications of the principle. Repositories can use different metadata standards to describe resources offered using OAI-PMH. For example, repositories exposing complex objects might want to describe them in MPEG21-DIDL or METS. However, at minimum they must offer Dublin Core metadata, where each Dublin Core record uses at least one of its dc:identifiers to identify the described object (content in the repository) using a dereferencable identifier, i.e. the identifier must resolve to the object it identifies (not into another identifier). In the special case of Dublin Core, which can be used to describe simple objects only (Van de Sompel, 2004), if more dereferencable URIs are present (which is syntactically correct), we suggest to use the first dereferencable identifier as the identifier of the described object. The identifier should resolve to the version of the object held in the repository, which is important for being able to acquire repository content statistics.  The second principle (page 4) says:  &gt; Open repositories must provide universal access to machines with the same level of access as humans have. It is the role of open repositories to allow machines harvest the entire  content of the repository in a reasonable time to enable harvesting systems to acquire and maintain up-to-date information about the repository content.  &gt; The implications of the principle. Repositories should ensure their content could be access by programs, for example to collect data for text-mining or indexing. This access must be universal, i.e. it should not discriminate or provide an unfair advantage to any particular system (with the exception of abusive behavior). Programs, such as content harvesters, must be allowed to access the repository at such frequency that allows them to keep information about the repository current. However, some repositories might contain both OA materials as well as non-OA materials. In such cases, it is acceptable and, in fact, beneficial to clearly restrict access to the non-OA materials. If a repository does not comply with this principle, it should not be considered an Open Repository.  I know you are in RIOXX quite logically restricting yourself to DC only. Since repositories often use multiple dc:identifier fields to describe a single resource using a DC record, I suggest at least one (and possibly the first one) of the dc:identifiers to be a global de-referenceble identifier of a resource stored in that repository, i.e. the identifier resolves to a URL under the domain of that repository. It is absolutely OK to specify other global identifiers in the next dc:identifier fields. These can resolve to items outside of that repository.   I personally do not think that there should be necessarily just one dc:identifier and most repositories do, in fact, use many instances of dc:identifier to describe a single record. For example, a repository can specify a dc:identifier for its local copy and then reference the copy at the publisher's website.   I really like that you require the item to be in the local repository, because this will, for example, allow to calculate repository statistics in terms of their content. This is crucial in order to be able to monitor full-text repository deposits (green OA) and compare them with gold OA (this is also why we need higher cardinality for dc:identifiers - to allow people link to both copies in the repository and outside of the repository). It is also essential in order to be able to verify compliance with the new OA policies (e.g. RCUK) regarding embargoes. For instance, it should be possible to check that an item is made available by the repository when the embargo expires. In addition, it would likely also help mitigate the second issue of machine access to resources described in the above mentioned paper. So overall, I think this should not be just SHOULD but in case the metadata record describes an item that is available it should be MUST.   I would suggest the following phrasing for dc:identifier:  &gt; dc:identifier  &gt; Cardinality: One or more  &gt; This field MUST contain a globally unique and persistent identifier for the resource being described. If the actual described resource is available, the identifier MUST be an HTTP URI that can be de-referenced (and is, thus, actionable) and resolves to the described resource held in the local repository. The purpose of this field is to allow access to the resource, therefore it is REQUIRED that this identifier should point to the actual resource being described by the RIOXX record (typically a PDF file), rather than to an intermediary resource such as a repository web page. The following dc:identifiers SHOULD also be de-referencable, but can link to content not held in the local repository, for example to the publisher's website.  Does it make sense?

That is to say, we need to collect two types of information for a given paper:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;the funder&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;the project or grant ID under which this research output was funded&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;RIOXX has at its heart a simple application profile of Dublin Core, the better to fit naturally with existing technical infrastructure and to be easily implemented. Following from this, it seems that there are the following possibilities for representing funder and projectID in a single record:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Funder and project id options\" src=\"/images/funder-and-project_id-options.png\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"option-1-separate-fields-for-funder-and-projectid\"&gt;Option 1: Separate fields for Funder and ProjectID&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;currently proposed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; approach. It has the virtue of introducing a very low barrier to data collection (the common repository interfaces support this) and provides for the primary use-case which is the collection of funding information about research outputs. In data-modelling terms, this is not a satisfying approach because it is not possible to relate a funder to a project ID within any given record. However:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;it should be possible to build this relationship, if required, after the data has been harvested, using other correlating  information (this is a trade-off for the requirement to implement this in existing platforms and workflows very soon)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;the expression of this relationship is not a requirement in the usecase we are addressing&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"option-2-separate-fields-for-funder-and-projectid-ordering-is-significant\"&gt;Option 2: Separate fields for Funder and ProjectID, ordering is significant&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not a viable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; option as data transfer using XML does not reliably support the ordering of values within multi-value fields.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"option-3-composite-field-for-funder-and-projectid\"&gt;Option 3: Composite field for Funder and ProjectID&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is an obvious choice for an approach which does not depend on any extra external development (for example of a global unique ID system for projects/grants). However, this approach could be disruptive to the interfaces and workflows faced by repository managers, and we are aiming for minimal disruption to repository managers who are, after all, a key stake-holder. This option is still open for discussion and, indeed, we are discussing this with developers from the ePrints and DSpace communities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"option-4-syntactically-rich-string-containing-funder-and-projectid-components\"&gt;Option 4: Syntactically rich string containing Funder and ProjectID components&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This approach concatenates funder and projectID into one string, using an agreed delimiter character to separate them. This is the approach used in the OpenAIRE guidelines, and one which we have considered closely. We have decided to reject this approach because the projectIDs we will need to accommodate are unpredictable, and liable to contain whatever character we use to delimit this string. There are approaches to mitigating this issue - notably using encoding approaches such as URLEncoding - but this places an extra processing burden on suppliers and consumers with no guarantee that this will be implemented - this approach is therefore considered non-optimal and 'fragile'.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"option-5-globally-unique-projectid\"&gt;Option 5: Globally unique projectID&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a more aspirational option - it cannot be implemented in the short-term because a system of globally uniques and persistent identifiers for grant-funded projects does not yet exist. However, in the medium-term this is feasible and is something we hope to explore in a later phase.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 id=\"next-steps\"&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are now working with experts from the ePrints and DSpace communities to figure out what is viable in the short term. Our default position is to implement &lt;em&gt;option 1&lt;/em&gt;. If we can implement &lt;em&gt;option 3&lt;/em&gt; without damaging the chances of the overall solution being adopted by repository managers on the common platforms, then this would be an attractive solution for the short term. For the longer term, we will continue to consider approaches to &lt;em&gt;option 5&lt;/em&gt; or, better still, a combination of &lt;em&gt;option 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;option 1&lt;/em&gt;, where the funders are also listed separately to the projectID (and actionable and persistent identifier which points to metadata about the funder), simply to avoid the need for multiple round-trip queries to, for example, list records with a given funder.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Comments on all/any aspects of this are welcome!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!-- ----  #### Comments  ##### Comment by [Pablo de Castro](http://www.repositorynet.ac.uk/) on 2013/01/30 at 11:13  Hi Paul,  I fully agree with the RIOXX conclusion of selecting Option 1 as the default one and checking out whether Option 3 (which would certainly provide far more accurate metadata) is technically and socially feasible. While steps are simultaneously being taken to provide the [FundRef](http://www.crossref.org/fundref/index.html)/GrantDOI system which will eventually enable Option 5, it might be useful as well to pay attention to this rather old proposal from funders in this regard \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd namely to feature some kind of standardised funder code within the ProjectID (Option 4) that will uniquely identify the funding agency for a given project. OpenAIRE guidelines do naturally take a simple approach to this, since it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds mainly EU FP7-funded projects they\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre dealing with, but major UK funders have already agreed a two- or three-letter code that will provide default funder identification for a given project (there should be a publicly available code list somewhere I presume?) The issue with this is of course that it was quite recently implemented and will therefore not be providing a solution for older projectIDs. But it would be useful anyway to keep track of initiatives aiming to provide automatic links between grantIDs and corresponding funders (including of course the one-to-many use case).
