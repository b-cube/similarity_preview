Multinationals are both a creature and an instrument of industrial structural change that characterizes the process of economic development.  In order for emerging markets to initiate and sustain catch&#8208;up industrialization, they need government involvement to spark a takeoff and nurture their own multinationals so that they can exploit overseas business opportunities at each stage of structural change. Hence, a stages model of growth with five tiers of industry is adopted as an overall analytic.  In this regard, Japan set two precedents in (i) transplanting low&#8208;wage production abroad via outward FDI as a catalyst for industrial upgrading at home (i.e., what may be called  &#8220;comparative advantage recycling in low-wage production&#8221;), and (ii) combining its resource-seeking FDI with economic cooperation in emerging host economies (i.e., development&#8208; oriented resources diplomacy). The precedent of low-wage production transplantation was followed by the NIEs and has just begun to be replicated by China. The precedent of FDI&#8208;cum-economic cooperation was likewise followed by South Korea and Taiwan and is currently most actively repeated by China in its efforts to secure overseas minerals and fuels.</abstract>    <subject>       <topic>Economics, Commerce-Business</topic>    </subject>    <subject>       <topic>Business</topic>    </subject>    <relatedItem type=\"series\" ID=\"r.1\">       <titleInfo>          <title>Center on Japanese Economy and Business Working Papers</title>          <partNumber>337</partNumber>       </titleInfo>    </relatedItem>    <relatedItem>       <location>          <url/>       </location>    </relatedItem>    <identifier type=\"CDRS doi\">http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D81Z42GM</identifier>    <relatedItem type=\"otherVersion\">     </relatedItem>    <language>       <languageTerm type=\"text\">English</languageTerm>    </language>    <location>       <physicalLocation authority=\"marcorg\">NNC</physicalLocation>    </location>    <recordInfo>       <recordContentSource authority=\"marcorg\">NNC</recordContentSource>       <recordCreationDate encoding=\"w3cdtf\">2014-03-21 11:26:09 -0400</recordCreationDate>       <recordChangeDate encoding=\"w3cdtf\">2014-03-21 11:52:39 -0400</recordChangeDate>       <recordIdentifier>14038</recordIdentifier>       <languageOfCataloging>          <languageTerm authority=\"iso639-2b\">eng</languageTerm>       </languageOfCataloging>    </recordInfo> </mods> ",
