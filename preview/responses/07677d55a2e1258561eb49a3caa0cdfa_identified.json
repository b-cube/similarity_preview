The estimates result from bridging the 31 race categories used in Census 2000, as specified in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified under the 1977 standards. The bridged estimates were produced under a collaborative arrangement with the United States Bureau of the Census. Three data files are provided. The first file (Part 1) contains bridged April 1, 2000, population counts for the four race groups (White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander) by county, single year of age, sex, and Hispanic origin. The other two data files (Parts 2 and 3) contain bridged postcensal estimates of the July 1, 2000, and July 1, 2001, resident populations of the United States for the four race groups by single year of age, sex, and Hispanic origin. Parts 4-8 are Excel files presenting various crosstabulations.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"2000\" cycle=\"P1\">2000</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"2001\" cycle=\"P1\">2001</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>All persons in housing units in the United States in 2000.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          Census 2000 Modified Race Data Summary File             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
