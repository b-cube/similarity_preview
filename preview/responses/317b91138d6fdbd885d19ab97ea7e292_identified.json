The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study. Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination (referred to as the Oyster Biomass Database), and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey). The first three stages occurred before the first nekton measurement, which was in March 1997. In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek. This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass. In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume. This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks. During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated. The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage. The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. Nekton samples were taken in March, June, August, and in November of 1997 and 1998, always following the same procedures. To sample the nekton present in creeks, a block net was set up at the mouth of each creek starting at a daybreak slack high tide on which the flooding level did not exceed the tops of the marsh banks (=bank full). At low tide, animals in block nets were collected and frozen. Because each creek contained tidal pools, seines were used to obtain nekton from areas retaining water and nekton at low tide. Each pool sample was also frozen. At the time of sampling, additional data such as water temperature, salinity, tidal height and time were recorded. In the months following, block net and pool samples were thawed and animals were sorted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (defined as 'species' in the following description). Length data [Standard Length (SL) in mm] were obtained for up to 100 individuals in each taxonomic category. Biomass data were obtained first for the 100 individuals, and then for the entire species sample (total weight for each species). Species abundance was extrapolated from the total weight when more than 100 individuals were collected. This procedure was followed for each species in the sample. For block nets, samples were thawed and split to a manageable volume following the preceding guidelines. Total species biomass and abundance were extrapolated from subsample data. Abundance and biomass calculations per cubic meter were determined using the volume estimates for each creek. See the CREEK Project's Tidal Creek Geomorphology Metadata (Corbett/Humphries GIS Survey) for more information about how the volume estimates for each creek were made.</dct:description>
