Originally collected by the Dimensionality of Nations (DON) Project   at the University of Hawaii, these data provide information on the   behavioral dimensions of the interactions between the nations in   the dyads. The dyads represent all of the paired relationships   for 14 nations. Variables such as economic aid, official visits,    treaties, co-participation in international conferences, exports,  tourist visits, intergovernmental organizations, common membership  in nongovernmental organizations, common blocs membership, and  military alliances measure positive interactions or cooperative  behavior between the nations. Other variables such as military   actions, negative behavior, severance of diplomatic relations,   expulsion or recall of diplomats and lesser officials, boycott or   embargo, aid to subversive groups or enemies, accusations, protests,   attacks on embassy, and lost territory from one nation to the other   measure conflictual interactions. The variables are arranged by  year and within year by dyad number.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1950\" cycle=\"P1\">1950</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1965\" cycle=\"P1\">1965</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>A total of 14 nations in the period 1950-1965.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) United Nations publications, (2) University of   Hawaii.
