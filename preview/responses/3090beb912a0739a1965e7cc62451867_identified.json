The 1000 genomes phased haplotypes were obtained from mathgen.stats.ox.ac.uk/impute and hapbin was run with default parameters. The iHS are provided in two formats; BED and bedGraph. For each SNP the iHS for the allele with the positive iHS is shown. In the BED format file the allele in question (0 or 1 as annotated in the original IMPUTE data) is indicated in the fourth column following the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd:\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The bedGraph formatted data can be easily viewed along the genome at the UCSC genome browser by specifying the URL to the corresponding file at http://genome-euro.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgCustom?clade=mammal&amp;org=Human&amp;db=hg37. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-11T16:57:30Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/671\"> <title>RNA composition metrics</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/671</link> <description>RNA composition metrics Mutating RNA virus genomes to alter codon pair (CP) frequencies and reduce translation efficiency has been advocated as a method to generate safe, attenuated virus vaccines. However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective. </description> <dc:date>2014-11-19T10:13:27Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/293\"> <title>Identification of miRNAs associated with the follicular-luteal transition in the ruminant ovary</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/293</link> <description>Identification of miRNAs associated with the follicular-luteal transition in the ruminant ovary Little is known about the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the follicular-luteal transition. The aim of this study was to identify genome-wide changes in miRNAs associated with follicular differentiation in sheep. miRNA libraries were produced from samples collected at defined stages of the ovine oestrous cycle and representing healthy growing follicles (diameter, 4.0-5.5 mm) pre-ovulatory follicles (6.0-7.0 mm), early corpora lutea (day 3 post-oestrus) and late corpora lutea (day 9). A total of 189 miRNAs reported in sheep or other species and an additional 23 novel miRNAs were identified by sequencing these libraries. miR-21, miR-125b, let-7a and let-7b were the most abundant miRNAs overall, accounting for 40% of all miRNAs sequenced. Examination of changes in cloning frequencies across development identified nine different miRNAs which expression decreased in association with the follicular-luteal transition and eight miRNAs which expression increased during this transition. Expression profiles were confirmed by Northern analyses, and experimentally validated targets were identified using miRTarBase. A majority of the 29 targets identified represented genes known to be actively involved in regulating follicular differentiation in vivo. Finally, luteinisation of follicular cells in vitro resulted in changes in miRNA levels that were consistent with those identified in vivo, and these changes were temporally associated with changes in levels of putative miRNA targets in granulosa cells. In conclusion, this is the first study to characterise genome-wide miRNA profiles during different stages of follicle and luteal development. Our data identifies a subset of miRNAs which are potentially important regulators of the follicular-luteal transition. </description> <dc:date>2013-03-26T15:14:57Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
