Here we present&#xD; a new Danian correlation framework resolved at the ~100-kyr&#xD; short-eccentricity level between the land-based Zumaia and&#xD; Sopelana hemipelagic sections from the Basque Basin and&#xD; deep-sea records drilled during ODP Legs 198 (Shatsky Rise,&#xD; North Pacific) and 208 (Walvis Ridge, South Atlantic) that&#xD; reconciles both the magnetostratigraphy and the short and longeccentricity&#xD; cycle patterns among the records and, hence,&#xD; improves synchroneity of events. The correlation has been&#xD; aided by composite images from ODP cores and a new wholerock&#xD; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd13C isotope record at Zumaia while its original&#xD; magnetostratigraphy (Dinar\\ufffd\\ufffds-Turell et al., 2003; 2010) is&#xD; reinforced by new data from Sopelana. Notably, we challenge&#xD; the correlation of the Pacific Sites 1209\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1210 that were offset&#xD; by as much as one 405-kyr cycle in previous interpretations&#xD; (i.e., the Fasciculithus spp. LO, which approximates the&#xD; Danian\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSelandian (D\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdS) boundary, and the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTop chron C27n\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#xD; climatic event were at odds between oceans in the&#xD; interpretation of Hilgen et al. (2010). It is found that the&#xD; Danian consists of 11 (and not 10) consecutive 405-kyr&#xD; eccentricity cycles.&#xD; The new consistent stratigraphic framework enables&#xD; accurate estimates to be made of ages for magnetostratigraphic&#xD; boundaries, bioevents, and sedimentation rates. Low&#xD; sedimentation rates appear common in all records in the mid-&#xD; Danian interval along the upper part of chron C28n, including&#xD; conspicuous condensed intervals in some of the oceanic&#xD; records that in the past have hampered the proper identification&#xD; of cycles. The new chronological framework, spanning a&#xD; duration of about 4.5 My, allows assessing the role of orbital&#xD; forcing on the paleoclimatic variability as registered by the&#xD; related isotope records. It appears clear that there exists a&#xD; periodic beat at the 100-ky and 405-ky eccentricity cycles&#xD; impressed in the record. The phase relationship between the&#xD; benthic isotope record and eccentricity is similar to patterns&#xD; documented for the Oligocene and Miocene, as indicated by&#xD; others, confirming the role of orbital forcing as the pace maker&#xD; for paleoclimatic variability on Milankovitch time scales. The&#xD; preferred tuning to the La2011 orbital solution provides&#xD; astronomically calibrated ages of 66.022\\ufffd\\ufffd0.040 Ma and&#xD; 61.607\\ufffd\\ufffd0.040 Ma for the (D\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdS) and Cretaceous\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPaleogene&#xD; (K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg) boundaries respectively. Finally, we envisage that the&#xD; Zumaia section, which already hosts the Selandian GSSP,&#xD; could serve as the global Danian stratotype.</description>     <dc:date>2014-06-30T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9208\">     <title>Data report: paleomagnetism and rock magnetism of sediments from offshore Canterbury Basin, IODP Expedition 317</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9208</link>     <description>Title: Data report: paleomagnetism and rock magnetism of sediments from offshore Canterbury Basin, IODP Expedition 317 Authors: Dinar\\ufffd\\ufffds-Turell, J.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Tinto, K.; Department of Geology, University of Otago, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand Abstract: Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were conducted on&#xD; discrete samples from sediments drilled during Integrated Ocean&#xD; Drilling Program Expedition 317 in the Canterbury Basin offshore&#xD; New Zealand to assess the nature of magnetic remanence and to&#xD; evaluate the directional data for a magnetic reversal stratigraphy.&#xD; The sediments consist of relatively coarse grained lithologies from&#xD; shelf to slope settings. The presence of several hiatuses, together&#xD; with very low core recovery in some intervals as well as drillingrelated&#xD; magnetic overprints, prevented establishment of a good&#xD; shipboard magnetostratigraphy. In an effort to overcome some of&#xD; the magnetic shortcomings and to substantiate shipboard measurements&#xD; (overprints and partial demagnetization to 20 mT),&#xD; natural remanent magnetization and subsequent full stepwise alternating&#xD; field or thermal demagnetization measurements were&#xD; taken on 765 individual discrete samples from Holes U1351B (131&#xD; samples), U1352B/U1352C (485 samples), U1353B (54 samples),&#xD; and U1354B/U1354C (95 samples). Some rock magnetic measurements,&#xD; including thermomagnetic curves, were taken on a few&#xD; representative samples to acquire information on the magnetic&#xD; carriers. The remanence intensity of the sediments is relatively&#xD; low (usually 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3 to 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd5 A/m) and often displays unstable behavior&#xD; upon demagnetization. Demagnetization data have been separated&#xD; into four different classes based on their quality. Classes 1&#xD; and 2 are of sufficient quality to be used for magnetostratigraphic&#xD; purposes and represent ~40% of the studied samples (although&#xD; some of them could still represent a steep magnetic drilling overprint).&#xD; Considering the calculated characteristic remanent magnetization&#xD; inclination, a number of polarity zones can be defined.&#xD; However, the fragmentary nature of the data set, mostly related to&#xD; core recovery in addition to detected and undetected sedimentary&#xD; hiatuses, makes determination of the precise position of the reversal&#xD; boundaries and their correlation to the geomagnetic polarity&#xD; timescale a difficult task. Nevertheless, when combined shipboard&#xD; and postcruise discrete measurements are placed within biostratigraphic&#xD; constraints, some magnetostratigraphic insights can potentially&#xD; refine the available age model. These insights include the&#xD; identification of the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary (C1r1r/C1n,&#xD; 0.778 Ma) at all four sites, the Gauss/Matuyama boundary&#xD; (C2An.1n/C2r.2r, 2.581 Ma) in Hole U1351B, and also the position&#xD; of the Olduvai Subchron (C2n, 1.778\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1.945 Ma) in Hole U1351B, which relates to the position of the classical&#xD; Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-06T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9206\">     <title>In Search of the Bartonian (Middle Eocene) GSSP (II): Preliminary Results from the Oyambre Section (Northern Spain)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9206</link>     <description>Title: In Search of the Bartonian (Middle Eocene) GSSP (II): Preliminary Results from the Oyambre Section (Northern Spain) Authors: Dinar\\ufffd\\ufffds-Turell, J.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Payros, A.; Fac.

The sections were correlated at a bed-by-bed scale through careful analysis of the lithological stacking pattern and significant sedimentary features. For spectral analysis, we used an available carbonate proxy record spanning 64 m of section below the K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg (Cretaceous\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPalaeogene) boundary at Zumaia containing 72 precession-related limestone\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmarl couplets. The continuous wavelet spectrum helped to determine and visualize the orbital forcing at both the short (~100 kyr) and long (405 kyr) eccentricity bands. We applied bandpass Gaussian filters to the carbonate record to extract the relevant periodicities and provide a cycle-numbering scheme starting at the K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg boundary. The full hierarchy of precession cycles and eccentricity-related bundles was then extended towards the base of the Zumaia section, which contains 33 short eccentricity-related bundles, thus spanning more than 3 Myr. The C31r\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdC31n chron boundary (estimated to occur at ~3.08 Myr prior to the K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg boundary) in the lower part of the succession was determined unambiguously in all three sections studied, although the C30n\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdC29r reversal could not be determined due to a pervasive reverse magnetization acting on the purplish lithologies in the upper part of the succession. Relevant calcareous plankton bioevents were able to be accurately placed on the cyclo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmagnetostratigraphic template. The cyclostratigraphic framework also allowed us to estimate the duration of previously defined sea-level-related, third-order depositional sequences in the basin, which appear to be strongly paced by the long-term 1.2 Myr obliquity amplitude modulating cycle.</description>     <dc:date>2013-06-30T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8888\">     <title>Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene Antarctic Glaciation/Deglaciation and Southern Ocean productivity</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8888</link>     <description>Title: Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene Antarctic Glaciation/Deglaciation and Southern Ocean productivity Authors: Villa, G.; Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMacedonio Melloni\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Parma, Parma, Italy; Fioroni, C.; Dipartimento di Scienze Chimiche e Geologiche, Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy; Persico, D.; Dipartimento di Fisica e Scienze della Terra \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMacedonio Melloni\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Parma, Parma, Italy; Roberts, A. P.; Research School of Earth Sciences, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia; Florindo, F.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: During the Eocene-Oligocene transition, Earth cooled significantly from a greenhouse to an icehouse climate. Nannofossil assemblages from Southern Ocean sites enable evaluation of paleoceanographic changes and, hence, of the oceanic response to Antarctic ice sheet evolution during the Eocene and Oligocene. A combination of environmental factors such as sea surface temperature and nutrient availability are recorded by the assemblages of calcifying organisms, and can be interpreted as responses to the following changes. A cooling trend, which started in the Middle Eocene, was interrupted by transient warming during the Middle Eocene Climatic optimum and by several short cooling episodes. The cooling episode at 39.6\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMa preceded a shift toward an interval that was dominated by oligotrophic nannofossil assemblages from ~39.1 to ~36.2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMa. We suggest that these oligotrophic conditions were associated with increased water mass stratification, low nutrient contents, and high efficiency of the oceanic biological pump that, in turn, promoted sequestration of carbon from surface waters, which favored cooling. After 36.2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMa, we document a large synchronous surface water productivity turnover with a dominant eutrophic nannofossil assemblage that was accompanied by a pronounced increase in magnetotactic bacterial abundance. This turnover likely reflects a response of coccolithophorids to changed nutrient inputs that was likely related to partial deglaciation of a transient Antarctic ice sheet and/or to iron delivery to the sea surface. Eutrophic conditions were maintained throughout the Oligocene, which was characterized by a nannofossil assemblage shift toward cool conditions at the Eocene\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOligocene transition. Finally, a warm nannofossil assemblage in the Late Oligocene indicates a warming phase.</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8882\">     <title>Paleomagnetism and biostratigraphy of sediments from Southern Ocean ODP Site 744 (southern Kerguelen Plateau): Implications for early-to-middle Miocene climate in Antarctica</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8882</link>     <description>Title: Paleomagnetism and biostratigraphy of sediments from Southern Ocean ODP Site 744 (southern Kerguelen Plateau): Implications for early-to-middle Miocene climate in Antarctica Authors: Florindo, F.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Farmer, R.

Site 744 is strategically positioned for high-latitude paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic studies because it lies within the southern domain of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and in proximity to the large and active Lambert Glacier-Amery Ice Shelf drainage system of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet. Magnetostratigraphic results were reported previously for this site, but technical difficulties and limited sampling prevented confident correlation of the magnetic polarity record with the geomagnetic polarity timescale. Our results, which are constrained by new semi-quantitative analyses of diatom assemblages and radiolarian first and last appearance events that are evaluated within a regional Southern Ocean biostratigraphic dataset through Constrained Optimization (CONOP) model runs, permit significant refinement of previous age models for the lower-to-middle Miocene sequence recovered at Site 744 (spanning the interval from ~ 21 to 13.7 Ma). An extended record of sediment accumulation, with average sedimentation rates of ~ 0.7\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.9 cm/kyr, is interrupted by a series of hiatuses in the middle Miocene. These disruptions in sediment supply, or erosional events, could mark a local response of north\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsouth fluctuations in the location and/or strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current during transient glacial events within the Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO; ~ 17 to 14.45 Ma). With the enhanced age control provided by this study, combined with a refined chronostratigraphy for the underlying upper Eocene to Oligocene strata, Site 744 becomes a good candidate for future high-resolution stable isotope and microfossil paleoecological work, which will further elucidate the late Paleogene and early Neogene paleoenvironmental history of the Southern Ocean.</description>     <dc:date>2013-10-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8879\">     <title>Postglacial sedimentary processes on the Storfjorden and Kveithola trough mouth fans: impact of extreme glacimarine sedimentation</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8879</link>     <description>Title: Postglacial sedimentary processes on the Storfjorden and Kveithola trough mouth fans: impact of extreme glacimarine sedimentation Authors: Lucchi, R.

The investigation has been conducted using a multidisciplinary approach to the study of sediment cores positioned on high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and TOPAS/CHIRP sub-bottom profiles.&#xD; &#xD; Core correlation and the age model were based on 27 AMS 14C samples, rock magnetic parameters, lithofacies sequences, and the presence of marker beds including two oxidized layers marking the post Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) inception of deglaciation (OX-2) and the Younger Dryas cold climatic event (OX-1).&#xD; &#xD; Sediment facies analysis allowed the distinction of a number of depositional processes whose onset appears closely related to ice stream dynamics and oceanographic patterns in response to climate change. The glacigenic diamicton with low water content, high density, and high shear strength, deposited during glacial maxima, indicates ice streams grounded at the shelf edge. Massive release of IRD occurred at the inception of deglaciation in response to increased calving rates with possible outer ice streams lift off and collapse. The presence of a several-meter-thick sequence of interlaminated sediments deposited by subglacial outbursts of turbid meltwater (plumites) indicates rapid ice streams' melting and retreat. Crudely-layered and heavily-bioturbated sediments were deposited by contour currents under climatic/environmental conditions favorable to bioproductivity.&#xD; &#xD; The extreme sedimentation rate of 3.4 cm a\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 1 calculated for the plumites from the upper-slope area indicates a massive, nearly instantaneous (less than 150 years), terrigenous input corresponding to an outstanding meltwater event. We propose these interlaminated sediments to represent the high-latitude marine record of MeltWater Pulse 1a (MWP-1a). Different bathymetric and oceanographic conditions controlled locally the mode of glacial retreat, resulting in different thickness of plumites on the upper continental slope of the Storfjorden and Kveithola TMFs. It is possible that the southern part of Storfjorden TMF received additional sediments from the deglaciation of the neighboring Kveithola ice stream.</description>     <dc:date>2013-11-30T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8878\">     <title>Iron oxide tracers of ice sheet extent and sediment provenance in the ANDRILL AND-1B drill core, Ross Sea, Antarctica</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8878</link>     <description>Title: Iron oxide tracers of ice sheet extent and sediment provenance in the ANDRILL AND-1B drill core, Ross Sea, Antarctica Authors: Brachfeld, S.; Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ 07043, USA; Pinzon, J.; Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ 07043, USA; Darley, J.; Department of Earth and Environmental Studies, Montclair State University, Montclair, NJ 07043, USA; Sagnotti, L.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Kuhn, G.; Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum f\\ufffd\\ufffdr Polar- und Meeresforschung, Am Alten Hafen 26, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; Florindo, F.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Wilson, G.; Department of Marine Science, University of Otago, PO Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand; Ohneiser, C.; Department of Geology, University of Otago, PO Box 56, Dunedin, New Zealand; Monien, D.; Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz-Zentrum f\\ufffd\\ufffdr Polar- und Meeresforschung, Am Alten Hafen 26, D-27568 Bremerhaven, Germany; Joseph, L.; Department of Environmental Studies, Ursinus College, Collegeville, PA 19426, USA Abstract: The AND-1B drill core recovered a 13.57 million year Miocene through Pleistocene record from beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antarctica (77.9\\ufffd\\ufffdS, 167.1\\ufffd\\ufffdE). Varying sedimentary facies in the 1285 m core indicate glacial\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinterglacial cyclicity with the proximity of ice at the site ranging from grounding of ice in 917 m of water to ice free marine conditions. Broader interpretation of climatic conditions of the wider Ross Sea Embayment is deduced from provenance studies. Here we present an analysis of the iron oxide assemblages in the AND-1B core and interpret their variability with respect to wider paleoclimatic conditions. The core is naturally divided into an upper and lower succession by an expanded 170 m thick volcanic interval between 590 and 760 m. Above 590 m the Plio-Pleistocene glacial cycles are diatom rich and below 760 m late Miocene glacial cycles are terrigenous. Electron microscopy and rock magnetic parameters confirm the subdivision with biogenic silica diluting the terrigenous input (fine pseudo-single domain and stable single domain titanomagnetite from the McMurdo Volcanic Group with a variety of textures and compositions) above 590 m. Below 760 m, the Miocene section consists of coarse-grained ilmenite and multidomain magnetite derived from Transantarctic Mountain lithologies. This may reflect ice flow patterns and the absence of McMurdo Volcanic Group volcanic centers or indicate that volcanic centers had not yet grown to a significant size. The combined rock magnetic and electron microscopy signatures of magnetic minerals serve as provenance tracers in both ice proximal and distal sedimentary units, aiding in the study of ice sheet extent and dynamics, and the identification of ice rafted debris sources and dispersal patterns in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica.</description>     <dc:date>2013-10-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
