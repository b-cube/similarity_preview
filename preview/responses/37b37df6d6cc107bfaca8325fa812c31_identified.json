After that date all Landsat commercial rights became the property of EOSAT.  EOSAT will still retain exclusive sales rights to all Thematic Mapper (TM) data until July 1994, at which time all Landsat data over ten years old will become available from the National Archive at the EROS Data Center (EDC).  The first satellite in the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) program was launched July 23, 1972 and designated ERTS 1.  In 1975 the program was re&#45;designated as the Landsat program to emphasize its primary area of interest, land resources.  The mission of Landsat is to provide for repetitive acquisition of high resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis.  The complete Landsat system consists of an observation platform in a near&#45;polar Earth orbit and ground installations to receive, process and distribute the data provided by the sensors carried on the satellite.  The platform carries two remote sensor systems and a data relay system along with attitude&#45;control and orbit&#45;adjust subsystems, power supply, transmitters to send the data to ground receiving stations and receivers for ground station commands.  The Landsat satellites are in a sun&#45;synchronous, near polar orbit with a ground swath extending 185 km (115 miles) in both directions.  Landsat 4 and 5 are inclined 98 degrees, have an orbital cycle of 16 days and an equatorial crossing of 9:45AM local time.  The altitude of the satellites is 705 km (437 miles) for both Landsats 4 and 5.  The Landsat platforms operate from a sun&#45;synchronous, near polar orbit imaging the same 185 km (115 miles) ground swath every 16 days.  Thematic Mapper (TM) data are received directly from Landsats 4 and 5 by a network of 15 worldwide ground stations.  Also, data are transmitted via a Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) to its ground terminal at White Sands, New Mexico and then relayed via a domestic communications satellite (DOMSAT) to the EOSAT data processing facility in Lanham, Maryland.  TM data are processed for radiometric and geometric corrections at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). </abstract>    <purpose>The mission of Landsat is to provide for repetitive acquisition of high resolution multispectral data of the earth's surface on a global basis.</purpose>    <langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata></descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>19941130 [date of acquisition]</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>ground condition OR [in the case or the unique TM scene inventory]</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>In work</progress>    <update>Daily</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>&#45;102.5</westbc>     <eastbc>&#45;94.6</eastbc>     <northbc>40.0</northbc>     <southbc>37.0</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>     <themekey>digital image map</themekey>     <themekey>TM</themekey></theme>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>Acknowledgement of the U.S. Geological Survey</useconst>   <native>ERDAS Imagine</native><natvform>ERDAS Image file (.img) </natvform><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg> National Center for Earth Resources Observation &amp; Science (EROS)</cntorg></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>47914 252nd Street</address><city>Sioux Falls</city><state>South Dakota</state><postal>57198&#45;0001</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>800&#45;252&#45;6151</cntvoice><cnttdd>605&#45;594&#45;6933</cnttdd><cntfax>605&#45;594&#45;6589</cntfax><cntemail>custserv@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo>  <dataqual>   <logic>All TM data</logic>   <complete>All TM imagery</complete>   <lineage>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>       <pubdate>19902003  [Archive date when EDC acquired TM exists]</pubdate>       <title>TM</title>       <geoform>map</geoform>       <pubinfo>        <pubplace>Sioux Falls, SD</pubplace>        <publish>U.S. Geological Survey</publish>       </pubinfo>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <typesrc>cartridge tape</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <sngdate>        <caldate>Unknown or acquisition date of actual TM image.</caldate>       </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea>TM</srccitea>    </srcinfo>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>       <pubdate>Unknown</pubdate>       <title>NOAA Series Polor Orbiting Satellites</title>       <geoform>Remote Sensing</geoform>       <pubinfo>        <pubplace>Sioux Falls, SD</pubplace>        <publish>U.S. Geological Survey</publish>       </pubinfo>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <srcscale>1000000</srcscale>     <typesrc>digital tape media</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <sngdate>        <caldate>19941130 [the date of acquisition]</caldate>       </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea>digital</srccitea>     <srccontr>panchromatic black and white</srccontr>    </srcinfo>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>       <pubdate>Unknown</pubdate>       <title>Project Ground and Photo Control</title>       <geoform>Remote Sensing Image</geoform>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <typesrc>Various media</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <sngdate>        <caldate>Unknown</caldate>       </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea>control_input</srccitea>     <srccontr>Horizontal and vertical control used to establish positions and elevations for reference and correlation purposes.</srccontr>    </srcinfo>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>       <pubdate>Unknown</pubdate>       <title>Report of Processing</title>       <pubinfo>        <pubplace>Sioux Falls, SD</pubplace>        <publish>U.S. Geological Survey</publish>       </pubinfo>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <typesrc>disc</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <sngdate>        <caldate>19940727</caldate>       </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>Date of processing software</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea></srccitea>     <srccontr></srccontr>    </srcinfo>    <procstep>     <procdesc> Thematic Mapper data downlinked via a domestic communications satellite is received and recorded on high density tapes at GSFC.  GSFC generates tape directories, mirror scan correction data, cloud cover and quality information from the downlinked data.  Systematic correction data (SCD) is generated after image acquisition.  This involves the following steps:  &#45;Correcting and validating the mirror scan and payload correction data &#45;Providing for image framing by generating a series of scene center parameters &#45;Synchronizing telemetry data with video data &#45;Estimating linear motion deviation of scan mirror/scan line corrections &#45;Generating benchmark correction matrices for specified map projections &#45;Producing along&#45; and across&#45;scan high&#45;frequency scan line matrices  These data are processed and reformatted onto a digital tape for use during the geometric correction process.  Processing the acquisition into the standard EOSAT Fast format is done at EOSAT headquarters in Lanham, MD.  The Fast format adheres to the following general conventions:  1. All field definitions strictly follow the ANSI and ISO standards. 2. Only the Band Sequential (BSQ) image structure is supported. 3. Image files consist of a single band of data. 4. Image files do not cross physical tape boundaries. 5. A digital product is referred to as a volume set.  Individual tapes are referred to as volumes. </procdesc>    </procstep>    <procstep><procdesc Sync=\"TRUE\">Metadata imported.</procdesc><srcused Sync=\"TRUE\">C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\battles\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\xml26.tmp</srcused><date Sync=\"TRUE\">20040204</date><time Sync=\"TRUE\">15574300</time></procstep></lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>   <direct>raster</direct>   <rastinfo>    <rasttype>pixel</rasttype>   </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <planar>     <mapproj>      <spaceobq>       <landsat></landsat>       <pathnum>27&#45;31</pathnum>       <feast></feast>       <fnorth></fnorth>      </spaceobq>     </mapproj>     <planci>      <plance>rows and columns</plance>      <coordrep>       <absres>1</absres>       <ordres>1</ordres>      </coordrep>      <plandu>meters</plandu>     </planci>    </planar>    <geodetic>     <horizdn>North American Datum 1983</horizdn>     <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>    </geodetic>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover> A TM scene has an Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV) of 30 square meters in bands 1&#45;5 and 7 while band 6 has an IFOV of 120 square meters on the ground.  The Thematic Mapper (TM) is an advanced, multispectral scanning, earth resources sensor designed to achieve higher image resolution, sharper spectral separation, improved geometric fidelity and greater radiometric accuracy and resolution than the MSS sensor.  TM data are sensed in seven spectral bands simultaneously.  Band 6 senses thermal (heat) infrared radiation.
