The IfSAR derived lake data layer provides an improvement over previously available datasets for the study area since it is more comprehensive and contemporary. Attributes assigned to the IfSAR-derived lake dataset include: area, lake elevation, elevation in 10, 25, 50, and 100 m buffers around a lake perimeter, the difference in elevation between the lake and these various buffers, whether a particular lake had a detectable drainage gradient exceeding 1.2 m, whether a particular lake intersected flowlines extracted from the National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD), potential susceptibility to drainage, NHD lake area, difference in area between the IfSAR and NHD lake data layers, whether a lake increased or decreased in area between these two datasets, the estimated difference in the radius of the lake based on a circle, an estimate of lake expansion rates over time, and likelihood of lake drainage as a result of lateral expansion by 2050 and 2100. We identified 4,515 lakes (13%) as being susceptible to drainage based on a detectable drainage gradient within 100 m of the lake shoreline and no intersection with the NHD flowline data layer (a proxy for a currently closed-basin lake). Of these 4,515 lakes, 3,145 were identified as an expanding lake based on an increase in lake area when comparing the IfSAR lake data layer to the NHD lake data layer. When applying estimated expansion rates of these lakes to detectable drainage gradients in the IfSAR data, it appears that 8 may drain as a result of lake expansion by 2050 and 32 by 2100. However, these numbers should be viewed as a minimum and conservative estimate since only one mechanism for drainage was explored and a conservative gradient of 1.2 m was used. Incorporation of river migration rates, headward erosion by streams, coastal erosion rates, blowout rates in the sand sea, water level change, ice-wedge degradation, and top-down permafrost thaw are also drainage mechanisms that could be incorporated into this dataset to provide more information on the timing associated with the drainage of lakes on the Western Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska.</abstract> <purpose>This dataset was developed with the intention of  testing the feasibility of using a recent, high-resolution DSM for extracting an updated lake vector polygon data layer for the Western Arctic Coastal Plain and to identify lakes that are potentially vulnerable to drainage.</purpose> <supplinf> Dataset Limitations: Due to the method used to create the DSM and the interaction of the SAR signal with surface water features, a technique known as hydrologic enforcement has been used to ensure that rivers flow downhill and that lakes and ponds have flat surfaces. Thus, the DSM is a product that underwent a fair bit of hydrological manipulation during post-processing. For lakes, this typically means that the water is flattened to the average elevation of the lake coast as defined by the DSM using the water edge visible in the orthorectified radar image (ORRI). Given that X-band SAR was used to acquire the DSM data, information on the true surface elevation of the lakes is received (albeit with noise and decorrelation and being dependent on surface roughness of the water). During the post-processing phase, lakes were leveled to constant elevation using the survey information acquired during data collection. In addition, all lake levels were checked to ensure that they were at least 0.1m below the surrounding land surface.   Lake Extraction:  A total of 312 IfSAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) tiles were merged to create a seamless mosaic for the 46,000 km2 study area.  As a result of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhydro-flattening\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd by the vendor during raw data processing, calculation of a slope derivative layer provides an initial approximation of water bodies for the study area.  Thus, the slope derivative layer was used to extract all surface water features for the study domain.  However, this technique for extracting waterbodies from the DSM inherently underestimates the entire perimeter of a water body by 1 pixel since the water body edge pixel always represents a non-zero slope.  To account for this underestimation in lake area, the expand feature in ArcGIS was used to automatically extend the perimeter of every water body by 1 pixel.  This binary raster file (water and non-water pixels) was then exported as a polygon vector for cleanup and analysis.    All features within 100 m of the study domain edge were removed from the dataset to prevent the inclusion of artificial drainage gradients associated with no data (0 m elevation) pixels.  Next, all non-lake polygons were manually removed from the dataset by overlying the polygon layer on the CIR orthophoto mosaic and using a scale of 1:24,000.  Once lakes had been isolated in the polygon data layer this was converted back to a 5 m resolution raster file for further editing.  During this phase, the performance of the IfSAR extracted lake layer was assessed using the CIR orthophoto mosaic.  In instances where there was an apparent discrepancy in the lake surface area between the two datasets the perimeter of the lake polygon was manually adjusted to match that of the CIR photos in raster space using the Arcscan tool in ArcMap.  This technique retained the raster grid network resolution (5 m) for depicting surface water area.  After this step was complete, the binary raster lake layer was converted back to a polygon vector layer and compared to the initial estimate of lake surface area for the region.  This resulted in the manual correction of 3,085 lakes or 9% of the lake population.  This exercise also provided an indirect accuracy assessment by indicating that 91% of the lakes were accurately retrieved using the automated approach.       Drainage Gradient Determination:  The ability to detect lake-based drainage gradients with the IfSAR DSM was assessed by comparing surface elevations of several overlapping tile edges.  These showed a range in standard deviation from 0.0 to 0.6 m in elevation.  Thus, we decided to choose a height difference of 1.2 m (twice the standard deviation) to represent a detectable drainage gradient adjacent to a lake feature.  This value is also in-line with the field verified estimates of the vertical accuracy of the datasets around Barrow [Manley et al., 2005] and the stated vertical RMSE of the DSM data [Intermap, 2010].  In order to identify lakes with a detectable drainage gradient a series of buffers (10, 25, 50, and 100 m) were used to compare elevation of the lake surface to the surrounding vicinity.  Lake Expantion rates: In order to provide a potential estimate for the timing associated with lake drainage candidates we focused on one potential drainage mechanism, expansion of a lake towards a drainage gradient.  Since not all lakes in the study region are expanding, the IfSAR lake data layer was compared to the NHD lake data layer to identify lakes that appeared to increase in size between the two datasets.  There are 23,673 lakes with a surface area larger in the IfSAR compared to the NHD.  These lakes were designated as potential expanding lakes and the change in radius of the polygon between the datasets was approximated based on a circle.  Since the NHD lake data layer has a varied history of updates we assessed the lake polygons relative to the original topographic digital raster graphics for the region that were based on mid-1950s imagery.  It was apparent that nearly every quadrangle had been updated since the 1950s and most likely with aerial photography from the late-1970s and early-1980s.  Thus, in order to compare how well this approximation of lake expansion would perform we contrasted the change in radius for 10 lakes for which detailed measurements of lake expansion were conducted based on 1979 and 2002 aerial photography [Arp et al., 2011]. The equation used to derive an estimate of lake expantion rates was y = 0.0832x-0.1141 where y is the estimated expansion rate and x is the change in radius between the NHD and IfSAR lake polygon layers. </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20020724</begdate> <enddate>20060913</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-158.726495</westbc> <eastbc>-150.730831</eastbc> <northbc>71.378182</northbc> <southbc>69.420089</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>User</themekt> <themekey>Projection of lake persistence</themekey> <themekey>Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC)</themekey> <themekey>Hydrologic gradients</themekey> <themekey>Thermokarst</themekey> <themekey>Lakes</themekey> <themekey>Digital Surface Model</themekey> <themekey>Lake Drainage</themekey> <themekey>Alaska</themekey> <themekey>Arctic Coastal Plain</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt> <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey> </theme> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>It is strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of the metadata file associated with these data to evaluate data set limitations, restrictions or intended use.

Features coded 999999 indicate a decrease in lake area or no value.</attrdef> <attrdefs>Originator</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Positive numbers</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Drain_2050</attrlabl> <attrdef>Features coded 1 indicate lakes that will likely expand across a detectable drainage gradient by the year 2050.
