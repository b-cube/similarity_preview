Specifically,  they were queried as to whether Clinton had a clear policy on the  situations in Somalia and Haiti and whether United States vital  interests were at stake in either country. Questions covered whether  the United States has the responsibility to take the leading role in  world affairs, whether the United States should send United States  troops to participate in United Nations peace-keeping efforts around  the world, and whether those troops should be placed under United  Nations command. Other questions focused on whether Clinton had  consulted Congress enough regarding sending United States troops to  participate in United Nations missions and whether Congress should  have the power to prevent a president from sending troops to  participate in such missions. Those queried were also asked whether  they agreed with the United States oil embargo on Haiti and whether  they supported sending United States troops to Haiti if democracy was  not restored. The results of the poll were announced on the ABC  television program \"Nightline\" the day the poll was taken. Demographic  background variables include political orientation, sex, age, race, income, and education.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1993-10\" cycle=\"P1\">1993-10</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1993-10\" cycle=\"P1\">1993-10</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adults aged 18 and over living in households with telephones.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Households were selected by random-digit dialing.
