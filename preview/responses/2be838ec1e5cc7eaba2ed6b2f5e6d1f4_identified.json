Public  access to many of these data is provided via the  USGS Water Data for the Nation site  (additional  background at http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/faq/additional-background).           The Groundwater database consists of more than  850,000 records of wells, springs, test holes,  tunnels,drains, and excavations in the United States.  Available site descriptive information includes well  location information such as latitude and longitude,  well depth, and aquifer.           The USGS annually monitors groundwater levels in  thousands of wells in the United States. Groundwater  level data are collected and stored as either discrete  field-water-level measurements or as continuous  time-series data from automated recorders. Data  from some of the continuous record stations are  relayed to USGS offices nationwide through telephone  lines or by satellite transmissions providing access to   current groundwater data. Once a complete day of  readings are received from a site,  daily summary  data are generated and made available online.           Each USGS Science Center serves the realtime data of  the stations it services. A list of these pages may be  seen at http://water.usgs.gov/realtime.html  Every  District realtime page (some have several pages)  contains a list of the stations for which realtime data  are available and a link to the data for each station.          Every day, an automatic process retrieves the realtime pages from each District and parses them to find the stations served and the URL for each station&apos;s data. The station numbers on this list are matched against a master list of USGS stations to find the station name and the latitude/longitude of each realtime station. This information is used to prepare an updated data set.          Groundwater Daily Data are derived by summarizing  time-series data for each day for the period of record.  The time-series data used to derive daily values,  sometimes referred to as current condition or  instantaneous values may be collected as often  as every minute. These data are used to calculate  daily data, such as the daily mean, median, maximum,  minimum, and/or other derived values. Daily data include  approved, quality-assured data that may be published,  and provisional data, whose accuracy has not been verified.             </supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>
