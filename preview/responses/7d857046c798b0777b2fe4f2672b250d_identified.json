Grae We incorporate a physically derived parameterization of gravity drainage,&#13; in terms of a convective upwelling velocity, into a one-dimensional, thermodynamic sea-&#13; ice model of the kind currently used in coupled climate models. Our parameterization&#13; uses a local Rayleigh number to represent the important feedback between ice salinity,&#13; porosity, permeability and desalination rate. It allows us to determine salt fluxes from&#13; sea ice and the corresponding evolution of the bulk salinity of the ice, in contrast to older,&#13; established models that prescribe the ice salinity. This improves the predictive power of&#13; climate models in terms of buoyancy fluxes to the polar oceans, and also the thermal&#13; properties of sea ice, which depend on its salinity. We analyze the behaviour of exist-&#13; ing fixed-salinity models, elucidate the physics by which changing salinity affects ice growth&#13; and compare against our dynamic-salinity model, both in terms of laboratory experiments&#13; and also deep-ocean calculations. These comparisons explain why the direct effect of ice&#13; salinity on growth is relatively small (though not always negligible, and sometimes dif-&#13; ferent from previous studies), and also highlight substantial differences in the qualita-&#13; tive pattern and quantitative magnitude of salt fluxes into the polar oceans. Our study&#13; is particularly relevant to growing first-year ice, when gravity drainage is the dominant&#13; mechanism by which ice desalinates. We expect that our dynamic model, which respects&#13; the underlying physics of brine drainage, should be more robust to changes in polar cli-&#13; mate and more responsive to rapid changes in oceanic and atmospheric forcing.

N.; Eglen, Stephen J. Background: Neural circuits can spontaneously generate complex spatiotemporal firing patterns during&#13; development. This spontaneous activity is thought to help guide development of the nervous system. In this study,&#13; we had two aims. First, to characterise the changes in spontaneous activity in cultures of developing networks of&#13; either hippocampal or cortical neurons dissociated from mouse. Second, to assess whether there are any functional&#13; differences in the patterns of activity in hippocampal and cortical networks.&#13; Results: We used multielectrode arrays to record the development of spontaneous activity in cultured networks of&#13; either hippocampal or cortical neurons every 2 or 3 days for the first month after plating. Within a few days of&#13; culturing, networks exhibited spontaneous activity. This activity strengthened and then stabilised typically around 21&#13; days in vitro. We quantified the activity patterns in hippocampal and cortical networks using 11 features. Three out of&#13; 11 features showed striking differences in activity between hippocampal and cortical networks: (1) interburst intervals&#13; are less variable in spike trains from hippocampal cultures; (2) hippocampal networks have higher correlations and (3)&#13; hippocampal networks generate more robust theta-bursting patterns. Machine-learning techniques confirmed that&#13; these differences in patterning are sufficient to classify recordings reliably at any given age as either hippocampal or&#13; cortical networks.&#13; Conclusions: Although cultured networks of hippocampal and cortical networks both generate spontaneous&#13; activity that changes over time, at any given time we can reliably detect differences in the activity patterns. We&#13; anticipate that this quantitative framework could have applications in many areas, including neurotoxicity testing and&#13; for characterising the phenotype of different mutant mice.

C.; Bednyakov, A.; Ruiz de Austri, R. We explore the effects of three-loop minimal supersymmetric standard model renormalisation group equation terms and some leading two-loop threshold corrections on gauge and Yukawa unification: each being one loop higher order than current public spectrum calculators. We also explore the effect of the higher order terms (often 2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3 GeV) on the lightest CP even Higgs mass prediction. We illustrate our results in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model. Neglecting threshold corrections at the grand unified scale, the discrepancy between the unification scale \\ufffd\\ufffds and the other two unified gauge couplings changes by 0.1% due to the higher order corrections and the difference between unification scale bottom-tau Yukawa couplings neglecting unification scale threshold corrections changes by up to 1%. The difference between unification scale bottom and top Yukawa couplings changes by a few percent. Differences due to the higher order corrections also give an estimate of the size of theoretical uncertainties in the minimal supersymmetric standard model spectrum. We use these to provide estimates of theoretical uncertainties in predictions of the dark matter relic density (which can be of order one due to its strong dependence on sparticle masses) and the LHC sparticle production cross-section (often around 30%). The additional higher order corrections have been incorporated into SOFTSUSY, and we provide details on how to compile and use the program. We also provide a summary of the approximations used in the higher order corrections.&#13; &#13; Program Summary&#13; Nature of problem: Calculating supersymmetric particle spectrum and mixing parameters in the minimal supersymmetric standard model. The solution to the renormalisation group equations must be consistent with boundary conditions on supersymmetry breaking parameters, as well as the weak-scale boundary condition on gauge couplings, Yukawa couplings and the Higgs potential parameters.&#13; &#13; Program title:SOFTSUSY&#13; &#13; Catalogue identifier: ADPM_v5_0&#13; &#13; Program summary URL:http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/ADPM_v5_0.html&#13; &#13; Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds University, Belfast, N.

If the parameter point under investigation is non-physical for some reason (for example because the electroweak potential does not have an acceptable minimum), SOFTSUSY returns an error message. The higher order corrections included are for the real R-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) only.&#13; &#13; Running time: A minute per parameter point.
