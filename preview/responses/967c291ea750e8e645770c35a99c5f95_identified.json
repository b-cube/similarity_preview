The data set represents the areas studied during the first decade of the NAWQA Program, from 1991-2001 (&quot;cycle 1&quot;).    </abstract>    <purpose>The National Water-Quality Assessment Program is a primary source for long-term, nationwide information on the quality of streams, ground water, and aquatic ecosystems (Gilliom and others, 2001). The goals of NAWQA are to assess the status and trends in the quality of the Nation&apos;s ground- and surface-water resources and to provide a sound understanding of the natural and human factors that affect the quality of these resources (Leahy and others, 1990).  Study Units are defined by major river basins and aquifers across the Nation (Gilliom and others, 2001).  This coverage contains the boundaries for the Study Units within the conterminous United States (excluding the High Plains Regional Ground Water-Study) that were defined during cycle 1 of NAWQA.  During cycle 1 of NAWQA, 51 studies actually were undertaken (49 in the conterminous U.S. and one each in Alaska and Hawaii), and 8 were not scheduled.  This coverage depicts 57 Study Units: 49 actually studied and 8 not scheduled. The coverage also includes the name, starting date, and NAWQA standard abbreviation of each Study Unit plus various codes to help display the data.  The second cycle of NAWQA (2001-2012) will adjust its scope to 42 of these important river basins and aquifer systems to accommodate budget reductions.  The second cycle of investigations began in 14 Study Units in 2001.  Although the boundaries of most Study Units remain the same in cycle 2, the boundaries and codes for cycle 2 Study Units are maintained in a separate data set (NAWQACYC2).  This data set is used primarily to display the location of NAWQA Study Units and for analysis of data at the national scale.  It is not recommended for either local or regional analysis due to the small scale of most of the features.    </purpose>    <supplinf>Originally, Study-Unit boundaries in this coverage were composed of 1:2,000,000-scale hydrologic unit boundaries (Allord, 1992) and state boundaries (Negri, 1994). As the NAWQA project progressed and Study-Unit Investigations got underway, many Study-Unit boundaries were modified.  In addition, Study Units enhanced their boundary coverages with features at higher resolutions. As these modifications were made, Study Units submitted their new boundary coverages to National Synthesis teams, who are responsible for summarizing the results from all of the Study Units, and the changes were incorporated into this coverage.  As a result, this coverage is composed of linear features at various scales (for example, 1:100,000, 1:250,000), but the majority remain at the 1:2,000,000 scale.  The original version of this coverage was generated by the USGS Cartographic and Publishing Program (CAPP) in Madison, Wisconsin, in the fall of 1991. The procedures used to create this coverage are described below.  Each NAWQA Study Unit was asked for a description of their boundary definition. Once this information was gathered, CAPP created the coverage by extracting digital features from the 1:2,000,000 Hydrologic Unit boundaries coverage and the 1:2,000,000 state boundaries coverage. Since the majority of Study-Unit boundaries are defined from hydrologic unit boundaries, most of the features were directly copied from the Hydrologic Units coverage. An exception to this was the boundary defining the Georgia-Florida Coastal Plain Study Unit where the northern boundary was defined by the northern edge of the Floridan Aquifer. To incorporate this boundary into the coverage, the aquifer boundary was digitized from the U.S. Geological Survey&apos;s &quot;Ground-Water Atlas of the United States&quot;, HA-730 (G) (Miller, 1990).  In November 1991, responsibility for maintaining the coverage was transferred to NAWQA&apos;s National Synthesis staff.  Major milestones in the development of the coverage and various revisions to the coverage are listed under the Lineage section.  The coverage is reviewed by one of the NAWQA National Synthesis GIS staff members prior to release.  Alaska (Cook Inlet) and Hawaii (Oahu) NAWQA Study-Unit boundaries are maintained in separate data sets.  The High Plains Regional Ground-Water Study boundary is in a separate data set.  Cook, Oahu, and High Plains study boundaries should be used with this data set to give the full picture of NAWQA Study Units nationwide.

The coverage underwent many changes over the years and was updated whenever the Study-Unit boundaries changed or were refined.  The changes fell into these broad categories: 1) the Study-Unit boundaries changed as the geographic definition of the boundary changed (features were added or deleted); 2) the digital boundaries were refined by acquiring more detailed source materials; and 3) changes in the NAWQA program necessitated revamping of the Study-Unit definitions.  Where a revised Study-Unit boundary was shared with another Study Unit, in general, a higher resolution boundary took precedence over a lower resolution boundary and the more recent version of a boundary took precedence over the older version of that boundary.    </update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-127.872474</westbc>     <eastbc>-65.356310</eastbc>     <northbc>51.601234</northbc>     <southbc>22.877918</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>National Water-Quality Assessment Program</themekey>     <themekey>NAWQA</themekey>     <themekey>Water quality</themekey>     <themekey>Surface water</themekey>     <themekey>Ground water</themekey>     <themekey>River basin</themekey>     <themekey>Aquifer system</themekey>     <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>None</placekt>     <placekey>Conterminous United States</placekey>    </place>    <stratum>     <stratkt>None</stratkt>     <stratkey>None</stratkey>    </stratum>    <temporal>     <tempkt>None</tempkt>     <tempkey>1991-2001</tempkey>    </temporal>   </keywords>   <accconst>None.</accconst>   <useconst>Accuracy is good at 1:2,000,000 or smaller in most cases.

Removed Central Oklahoma and Central High Plains.  Replaced them with two new areas: Middle Arkansas River Basin and Canadian-Cimarron River Basins.  The new coverages were extracted mostly from the 1:250,000 HUC coverage.  Part of the boundary came from an 11-digit HUC coverage.  HUC 11060006050 was added to Canadian-Cimarron area and removed from Middle Arkansas so that all of the Keystone Reservoir was included in the Canadian-Cimarron.  Original coverages were supplied by Jamie Schlottmann Norvell.  The new boundaries replaced those of Rio Grande, Southern High Plains, Upper Arkansas, and Kansas where they were adjacent to the existing boundaries.     </procdesc>     <procdate>19951025</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Version 4.1 - Northwestern portion of Mississippi Embayment boundary was expanded by adding HUC 7140107 and the western portion of HUC 11010014; Northern New England Basins and Southeastern New England Basins merged into one Study Unit - New England Coastal Basins (NECB), scheduled to begin in fiscal year 1997.     </procdesc>     <procdate>19960619</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Version 4.2 - Northern Rockies Intermontane Basins, Great Salt Lake, Southern High Plains - all of which were originally &apos;94 Study Units - have become &apos;97 Study Units. Kentucky, Canadian-Cimarron, Upper Arkansas, Kansas, North Platte, and Cheyenne - all formerly &apos;97 Study Units - no longer have a scheduled date.

The Study-Unit boundary was replaced with the basin boundary for station 03568000, which is the integrator site for the entire Upper Tennessee.  Removed Lake Okeechobee from Southern Florida Study Unit, since no other lakes are delineated separately.     </procdesc>     <procdate>19961205</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Version 4.5 - Replaced South Central Texas with enhanced boundary coverage from Lu Tan; replaced Connecticut with enhanced boundary coverage from Pete Steeves.     </procdesc>     <procdate>19970306</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Version 4.6 - Expanded item NAME in .PAT from 40 characters to 50 characters so full Study-Unit names (with no abbreviations) could fit into this field.     </procdesc>     <procdate>19970516</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Version 4.7 - Changed Delmarva and Yakima from group 3 to group 4 in accordance with email from Bill Wilber.     </procdesc>     <procdate>19970908</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Version 5 - Incorporated new boundaries for UIRB and LIRB using coverages supplied by the Study Units.  The LIRB boundary was higher resolution than the UIRB boundary, so the LIRB boundary had priority where the two shared a boundary.  The WMIC boundary was replaced where it was coincident with UIRB.  Changed Study-Unit starting dates to match recent programmatic changes within NAWQA.  Group 4 = Planned to begin in FY 99 (DLMV, YAKI) Group 5 = Unscheduled (CHEY, KNTY, UARK) Group 6 = Unscheduled, overlap the High Plains study (CACI, KANS, MARK, NPLT, SHPL) Group 7 = CNBR (overlaps the High Plains study; now in a separate group to distinguish it from other FY 91 studies)  Changed item CANADA to INTL.

The numbers originally were based on administrative regions, but are not anymore.  See table 1.  NAME contains the full name of the Study Unit.  See table 1.  GROUP represents the assessment schedule of Study-Unit investigations:  &gt;Group 1 = Assessed during 1991-1995 &gt;Group 2 = Assessed during 1994-1998. &gt;Group 3 = Assessed during 1997-2001.  (Includes DLMV and YAKI, &gt;          which started in 1999.) &gt;Group 4 = Not scheduled for study during cycle 1. (KNTY, UARK, CHEY, CACI, NPLT, MARK, SHPL, KANS).  PILOT flags those polygons that were pilot projects, although the boundaries of the pilot projects were not maintained in this coverage.  (For example, COKL boundaries were replaced when CACI was delineated.)  SUID contains the 4-letter abbreviation for the Study Unit.  The alternate name is ABBV.  See table 1.  INTL flags those polygons located in Canada or Mexico. Usually polygons outside of the United States are NOT plotted on national displays of the boundaries.  INTL is in both the .AAT and the .PAT and is used primarily for plotting purposes. (USBND, SUBND, G1BND, G2BND, G3BND, and G4BND are in the .AAT and are also used for plotting.)  MI2 is the area of an individual polygon in square miles, calculated as MI2 = AREA * .0000003861.  To find the area of an entire Study Unit, sum the areas of the individual polygons comprising the Study Unit.  REGION is the USGS water resources administrative region:  &gt;N = Northeast &gt;S = Southeast &gt;C = Central &gt;W = Western  STUDIED is a flag for whether the Study Unit was actually studied during cycle 1 of NAWQA (1991-2001).  &gt;Y     = actually studied during cycle 1 &gt;N     = not studied during cycle 1 &gt;Blank = was not designated as a Study Unit during cycle 1  Table 1.--NAWQA 4-letter abbreviations (SUID), names (NAME), and numbers (NAWQA).  &gt;
