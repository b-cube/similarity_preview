Which is fine for global audiences, but if a film with a conservation message is aimed at a community, wouldn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt it be better if it was made by someone in that community?</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This is the premise behind <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://conservationfilms.org/community/\">Local action for global impact - community-based biodiversity conservation films</a>, a Leicester-led project which finished last month but will continue in a new form. To date, more than 80 young people in East Africa have been trained up in filming and editing techniques and between them they have produced about 200 short films on environmental themes.</p> <p>Dr David Harper from our <a title=\"Biology\" class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\">Department of Biology</a> has been instrumental in the project which was established in 2008 with funding from the UK Government\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/\">Darwin Initiative</a>. The initial idea came from <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.brockinitiative.org/\">Richard Brock</a>, who before becoming a freelancer, produced the first two of David Attenborough\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds amazing series <em>Life on Earth</em> and <em>The Living Planet</em>.</p> <p>After a decade of freelance film-making, Richard retired and resolved to give something back to the communities which he had visited on his travels. David Harper&nbsp;had known Richard since they met in Kenya in 2002 and together they applied for a grant with the aim of bringing film-making expertise and technology to areas which are \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbiodiversity rich but resources poor.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Aspiring film-makers are identified through existing ecological organisations and then given a few weeks\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd intensive training in all aspects of the process, both technical and logistical. They learn how to use a Panasonic or Canon digital video camera and how to edit on an Apple laptop in Final Cut Pro. They also learn sound recording techniques, good interviewing techniques and all the other skills required to create a short film which is good enough to show to an audience.</p> <p>The resulting films - usually in English but occasionally in Swahili, and subtitled in either \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are shown by local educational officers from the Government, NGOs and charities and have also been shown on Kenyan and Tanzanian TV. A ten-minute film that looks at a situation from the same point of view as its audience will always have much more effect than an hour of David Attenborough-narrated footage, however magnificently shot.</p> <p>There is no point in explaining the marvels of flamingos or monkeys to people who see such animals every day so the subjects covered are those which matter to local communities. The perils of erosion through over-grazing, for example, or the ecological benefits of bee-keeping.</p> <p>Although the funding ended in October 2010, the project continues as a not-for-profit company with the same name. Already it has become to some extent self-perpetuating as nearly half the trainees have actually been trained up by their peers.</p> <p>The only problem, David Harper notes, is that some of the equipment which was still under guarantee has been returned to the UK for repair. One of the perils of shooting in Africa: on removing the casing it was discovered that the laptops were full of insects and sand...</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conservation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Film</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2010-11-02T13:58:59Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2010-archive/october-2010/public-lecture-on-use-of-sound-to-study-microscopic-subjects\">     <title>Public lecture on use of sound to study microscopic subjects</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2010-archive/october-2010/public-lecture-on-use-of-sound-to-study-microscopic-subjects</link>     <description>We are sorry to announce that this event has been cancelled.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>A public lecture tomorrow (8 October) will describe how researchers can not only view microscopic items but listen to them too.</p> <p>By using lasers and glass beads, scientists can detect minuscule amounts of movement in the fluid surrounding a item such as a cell</p> <p><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.gla.ac.uk/faculties/fbls/systemsbiology/people/joncooper/\">Professor Jon Cooper</a>, Professor of Bioelectronics and Bioengineering at the University of Glasgow, will present tomorrow\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lecture entitled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSound and Vision: Manipulation of Biology using Acoustics and Light\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.</p> <p>The event, which&nbsp;is free and open to the public, has been organised by our <a title=\"College of Science and Engineering\" class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/colleges/scieng\">College of Science and Engineering</a>.

We look at repetitive DNA and its evolution, with a particular focus on tandemly repeated satellite sequences and retrotransposons. Key methods include molecular cytogenetics, DNA sequence analysis and systems biology approaches. Taking a comparative genomics approach, we have interlinked projects with a range of different species: a particular focus is on plant crop species (banana, cereals including wheat, rye and barley, brassicas, and cowpea), while important projects include work with Dictyostelium, Drosophila, Scallops (Pecten), and bovids.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The main page is accessed from <a href=\"http://www.molcyt.com\">www.molcyt.com</a></p> <p></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>phh4</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biological Sciences</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2008-08-29T11:30:16Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/Members/nh88/home\">     <title>Research Overview</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/Members/nh88/home</link>     <description>Professor Nicholas Hartell</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h2 class=\"underline\">Laboratory for Synaptic Imaging</h2> <p><img class=\"image-left\" width=\"127\" alt=\"Purkinje Warhol\" title=\"Purkinje Warhol\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/Members/nh88/images/Purkinje%20Image%20wallpaper.jpg/image_thumb\" height=\"128\" />A central theme of the research carried out in this laboratory is the cellular mechanisms of memory storage. Memory is thought to be encoded as long lasting changes in the strength of signalling between synapses formed by excitable cells in the brain. By gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory acquisition, we aim to improve our ability to enhance the brains capacity to learn and develop strategies for repair following injury or neurodegenerative diseases that affect memory, such as Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease.</p> <p>One of the models of synaptic plasticity that we study is the long-term depression of transmission at the synapse formed between cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje cells. So called LTD may provide the mechanism for learning in the motor system, allowing acquisition of skilled movements during development and practice. Over the last few years, we have examined the contributions of numerous receptors and second messengers to LTD and other forms of plasticity at this synapse, including calcium, nitric oxide, cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and arachidonic acid.</p> <p>We are currently working towards developing methods of visualising transmitter release and receptor trafficking using fluorescent protein based sensors. Our long term goal is to to be able to visualise synapses \"learning\".&nbsp;We have an interest in developing high speed and high resolution confocal and multiphoton microscopes to allow us to examine the activity of cells within complex neuronal circuits.
