We recognize that multiple physical processes are affected by the same climate history and ice-sheet evolution.  By combining several processes into one self-consistent model based on physics of ice-sheet flow, heat flow, grain growth, and firn compaction, I can infer the climate history (accumulation rate and delta-age) and ice-sheet evolution (thickness and divide position), that match data sets from ice cores and ice-penetrating radar layers.  Ice-sheet behavior has not previously been modeled to enforce self consistency.  The self-consistent approach consists of modules, or subroutines, representing physical processes.  I have developed forward models to simulate firn densification, grain growth, heat transfer, and ice flow, and inverse models to infer histories including the spatial pattern of accumulation, and the depth-age relationship for ice cores and radar layers.  While individual modules can be replaced with modules based on a variety of physical approximations, I provide here proof of the concept that multiple data sets and multiple processes can be combined to provide improved estimates of ice-sheet histories that cannot be directly measured.  This new approach provides a way to improve ice-core chronologies from Greenland and Antarctica, and to infer self-consistent histories of climate and ice-sheet evolution at those locations.

I show that the magnetization curve for an ensemble of superparamagnetic particles depends only on odd moments of the volume distribution $\\\\rm(\\\\langle V\\\\rangle,\\\\langle V\\\\sp3\\\\rangle,\\\\...).$ As long as the ensemble is isotropic, the magnetic anisotropies of individual particles do not affect the curve. I derive analytical expressions for acquisition and loss of isothermal remanent magnetization in single-domain (SD) particles with uniaxial anisotropy. These curves depend only on the volume-average anisotropy. Plots of acquisition against loss of remanence can be used to distinguish uniaxial anisotropy from cubic anisotropy. I show that existing multi-domain (MD) hysteresis models, including the theory of Neel (1955) for thermoremanent magnetization, are internally inconsistent. I develop a simple self-consistent two-domain model and show that the slope of the hysteresis curve is always $1/N,$ where N is the demagnetizing factor for a two-domain particle.Using micromagnetic theory, I derive analytical expressions for the critical sizes $L\\\\rm\\\\sb{sw},$ the upper limit for SD hysteresis, and $L\\\\rm\\\\sb{n},$ the upper limit for stability of the SD remanent state. $L\\\\rm\\\\sb{sw}$ depends weakly on elongation and not at all on magnetocrystalline anisotropy, but$$L\\\\sb{\\\\rm n} = L\\\\sb{\\\\rm sw}\\\\ \\\\left({N\\\\sb{\\\\rm b}\\\\over N\\\\sb{\\\\rm a}}\\\\right)\\\\sp{\\\\sp{1/2}}\\\\left(1-{2\\\\kappa\\\\over\\\\mu\\\\sb0M{\\\\sbsp{\\\\rm s}{2}}N\\\\sb{\\\\rm a}}\\\\right)\\\\sp{\\\\sp{-1/2}}$$where $N\\\\sb{\\\\rm a} &gt; N\\\\sb{\\\\rm b}$ are demagnetizing factors and $\\\\kappa$ depends on the combined magnetocrystalline and magnetoelastic anisotropy. Mainly because of the the difference in $Ms,\\\\ L\\\\rm\\\\sb{n}$ is orders of magnitude larger for a particle of $\\\\rm Fe\\\\sb{2.4}Ti\\\\sb{0.6}O\\\\sb4$ than for a particle of magnetite with the same aspect ratio.I develop a technique for eliminating unstable solutions of three-dimensional numerical micromagnetic models. I show that nucleation theory can be extended to non-ellipsoidal particles. The nucleation field $H\\\\sb{\\\\rm n}$ for a cuboid can be precisely located by a change in slope dM/dH and the appearance of curl in the magnetization. For a cube with $K\\\\sb1 = 0,$ the plot of $H\\\\sb{\\\\rm n}$ against $1/L\\\\sp2$ has the same slope as for a sphere, but the intercept is lower, reflecting a smaller average demagnetizing field. $H\\\\sb{\\\\rm n}$ is not affected by the demagnetizing field in the corners of the particle.

The initial disturbances in the stratigraphy have their roots in transient dynamic processes and local rheological inhomogeneities, but the kinematics of even a simple ice flow model can deform these disturbances enough to alter paleoclimatic interpretation of an ice core. This study focuses on this deformation, treating the disturbed strati-graphic  layers as passive markers in the large-scale flow.The two major tools that I use to study overturning are core-relative isochrones (precores) and the deformation gradient tensor along a particle path. This tensor is used to calculate the rotation of stratigraphic segments of various orientations. It is also used in a stochastic model to derive the probability distribution of observing overturned segments given a probability distribution of the initial disturbances.Overturn probabilities increase downstream along a path. They also increase with depth, unless the initial disturbance processes are concentrated at a particular depth. Because of rapid rate of rotation of near-vertical segments, the probability of seeing obvious overturning in a small ice-core cross-section is low even if recumbent folds are present. Gentle disturbances are more likely to be overturned if they occur deep in the ice where the shear is strongest.Overlaying precores on divide arch isochrones shows that ice divide movement can produce recumbent folds. This movement must have a stop-start quality, with enough stability to produce mature arching, but also enough movement to leave an orphaned disturbance on the flank where it can be overturned. Such folding may be most likely downstream from ice ridges bounded by variable ice streams.The variation in the vertical thickness of a disturbed layer is also examined. Even if a disturbance is not overturned, some portions will be thinned more than undisturbed layers while other portions will be thickened. Passive deformation may reduce or exaggerate certain aspects of dynamically produced stratigraphic disturbances, but it does not obliterate them. Thesis (Ph.

Though changing atmospheric properties can influence infrasonic amplitudes and arrival times, they do not significantly distort the original waveform. Because of the simplicity of acoustic propagation filters (compared to seismic propagation filters), recorded infrasonic pressure waveforms can reveal the overpressure time history at the vent which may be integrated to estimate explosive gas mass flux. Digitized video records are able to substantiate the relationship between infrasound intensity and the rate change of gas mass flux released during an explosion.This dissertation analyzes and interprets the radiated infrasound and seismicity produced by five different active volcanoes. The case studies encompass low-viscosity Strombolian activity (Erebus, Antarctica), medium viscosity Strombolian activity (Karymsky, Russia and Sangay, Ecuador), a more vigorous Vulcanian eruption (Tungurahua, Ecuador), and degassing explosions from an active dacitic dome (Pichincha, Ecuador). The complexity of both the infrasonic and seismic waveforms at these five volcanoes appears related to the viscosity and volatile content of the different magmas. Erebus explosion signals are uniform, short-duration bursts because gas is able to easily escape the low-viscosity magma. Conversely, extended-duration degassing signals at the other volcanoes can be attributed to higher magma viscosity.At both Erebus and Karymsky, arrays of low-frequency microphones and seismometers were deployed within several kilometers of the degassing source to quantify the elastic energy that propagates into the ground and into the atmosphere. Acoustic efficiency (relative to the radiated seismic energy) is attributed to shallow explosion sources with associated impulsive gas outflux. Strombolian explosions at Erebus appear acoustically efficient compared to Karymsky because gas release occurs at the surface of the lava lake. Karymsky explosion sources emanate from shallow depths within the conduit diminishing the impulsivity of gas release from the vent of the volcano. Scatter in the seismic-acoustic energy radiation at Karymsky reveals that conditions in the conduit change during the course of an explosion. Thesis (Ph.
