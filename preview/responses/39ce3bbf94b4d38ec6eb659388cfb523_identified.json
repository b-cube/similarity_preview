However, vertebrates, including humans, also possess a cluster of dopamine-containing neurons in the forebrain.</p> <p>\"Unlike their midbrain counterparts, these neurons extend projections to the spinal cord, a region that is dedicated to the production of motor behaviours (such as walking and swimming). We know relatively little about the role this forebrain population plays in regulating behaviour: the main aim of our study was to address this problem.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The Leicester team was able to overcome this problem by examining hatchling zebrafish which are transparent and lack bone tissue, which makes the brain accessible to study. Based on this study, Dr McDearmid said that to date, researchers had not been able to get such clear insights into the inner workings of the brain.</p> <p>The research is important as it helps scientists to better understand the role that dopamine plays in controlling behaviour. In addition, dopaminergic drugs that are used to treat neurological disorders such as Schizophrenia often cause motor side-effects which could be mediated by altered dopamine signalling in the spinal cord. Thus, a better understanding of how dopamine acts in this part of the nervous system may help inform development of new drugs that have fewer motor side effects.</p> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/january/novel-study-on-dopamine-neurons-could-instruct-research-into-mobility-and-neurological-disorders\">Press Release </a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-29T17:01:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/december/bugs-life-the-nerve-cells-that-make-locusts-2018gang-up2019\">     <title>Biologists identify nerve cells that make locusts form gangs</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/december/bugs-life-the-nerve-cells-that-make-locusts-2018gang-up2019</link>     <description>Biologists from Universities of Leicester and Sydney reveal behavioural changes in locusts through serotonin-producing cells </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>A team of biologists has identified a set of nerve cells in desert locusts that bring about \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgang-like\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd gregarious behaviour when they are forced into a crowd.</p> <p>Dr Swidbert Ott from the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\">Department of Biology</a>, working with Dr Steve Rogers at the University of Sydney, Australia, has published a study that reveals how newly identified nerve cells in locusts produce the neurochemical serotonin to initiate changes in their behaviour and lifestyle.</p> <p><dl style=\"width:170px;\" class=\"image-left captioned\"> <dt><a rel=\"lightbox\" href=\"/news/blog/images/2014/Locustindepth.jpg\"><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/2014/Locustindepth.jpg/@@images/4e321edf-2b70-4105-90f9-6ca9744d8fb0.jpeg\" alt=\"Locustindepth.jpg\" title=\"Locustindepth.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"170\" /></a></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:170px;\">Computer reconstruction of nerve cells in a desert locust that produce the neurochemical serotonin.

This provides unique conditions to form a variety of different habitats and dissuades single species of plants from overgrowing and choking the channel. This will also have an overall positive impact on the water quality in the river.</p> <p>This reintroduction of habitats previously missing through Market Harborough will encourage a greater diversity of aquatic animals, with more species of aquatic invertebrates, which will benefit insects, birds, and mammals further up the food chain.

Although this was a ground breaking result, it was later showed that the atmospheric conditions used in this experiment did not correspond to the ones of our primitive planet.</p> <p>As the Earth was heavily bombarded by comets, asteroids, meteorites and interplanetary dust particle (IDPs) 4.6 to 3.8 million years ago, the exogenous delivery of organic compounds is an alternative. In fact, carbonaceous meteorites have a rich organic inventory, and may have provided the first building blocks of life to the primitive Earth. As future space missions will investigate the possibility of past and/or present extra-terrestrial life, it is important to determine how life may have originated in other places of our solar system, and how to detect possible bio-signatures.</p> <p>This talk will discuss how the study of meteorites, asteroids, comets and Mars soil analogues is used to investigate the origin of life on Earth and how to detect any possible signatures of extra-terrestrial life in our solar system.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/public-events/research-lectures/zita-martins/research-lecture-zita-martins-flyer\" class=\"internal-link\">Flyer for this event</a></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <h2 class=\" \">Dr Zita Martins<img style=\"float: right; \" alt=\"Zita Martins_profile\" class=\"image-inline\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/assets/ZitaMartins.jpg/@@images/292810ad-3c84-441c-a64c-ab01cecf99ef.jpeg\" title=\"Zita Martins_profile\" /></h2> <p>Dr Zita Martins is a Royal Society University\\ufffd\\ufffdResearch Fellow at Imperial College London.

<p>But the study, carried out in flies, found that sickness induced insomnia is quite common.</p> <p>Dr Mallon said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThink about when you are sick. \\ufffd\\ufffdYour sleep is disturbed and you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre generally not feeling at your sharpest. \\ufffd\\ufffdPreviously work has been carried out showing that being infected leads to exactly these behaviours in fruit flies.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIn this paper we show that it can be the immune system itself that can cause these problems.

Plants with mutated versions of DAZ1 and DAZ2 produce pollen grains with a single sperm that is unable to fertilize.</p> <p>The research shows that DAZ1 and DAZ2 are controlled by the protein DUO1 that acts as a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmaster switch\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd - so that DUO1 and the DAZ1/DAZ2 genes work in tandem to control a gene network that ensures a pair of fertile sperm is made inside each pollen grain.</p> <p>Interestingly, DAZ1 and DAZ2 perform their role by cooperating with a well-known \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrepressor\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd protein called TOPLESS that acts as a brake on unwanted gene activity that would otherwise halt sperm and seed production. Although TOPLESS has many roles in plants it has not previously been linked sperm production.</p> <p>This new knowledge has the potential to be applied in the development of new plant breeding techniques to prevent the unwanted passing of genes \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhorizontal gene transfer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd - between crops or from crops to wild species and could generate new ways of monitoring the effects of, environmental stresses on the reproductive process.
