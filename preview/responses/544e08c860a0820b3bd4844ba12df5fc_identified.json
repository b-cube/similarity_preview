This work is an intertextual analysis and synthesis of self-allusive poems by Boris Pasternak, Ted Hughes, Gyula Illyes, and Gennady Aygi. Poems by other authors are also discussed briefly, or linked to the main texts through epigraphs. Contemplation of snow through a window is the central theme of the focused texts. Snowflakes falling on the window pane allegorically represent words on the page, and the observation of this process is a metaphor for the ongoing creative and receptive acts. Meditative contemplation of nature and of the processes of writing and reading are portrayed as means for an introspective self-discovery of imagination. The threshold experience of observing the creative mind as it is externalised in nature and embodied in the poetic text involves a deconstructive reversal and overlapping of the external and the internal worlds, and other opposites. The complex mental process of watching the internal in what is external is comparable to the fusion of the optical effects of transparency and reflection on a window. The works analysed reveal that poems can function both as 'windows' displaying external phenomena, and as symbolic 'mirrors' in which one can catch a glimpse of the working of imagination at the very act of simultaneously outward and inward contemplation. The methodological scope of this work is primarily concerned with the intertextual connective function of recurring poetic images (symbols). The metaphorical symbol is a&#13; central embodiment of imagination. By focusing on recurring symbols, one can establish links between literary texts and between various imaginative systems (such as literature, mythology, music and visual arts) on a primarily aesthetic basis, without recourse to extraliterary criteria. Northrop Frye's Theory of Symbols, Jungian archetypal criticism, Iurii Lotman's models of communication, and more recent theoretical works by Harold Bloom, Michael Riffaterre, Owen Miller, Roland Barthes, Jonathan Culler, Jacques Derrida, and other scholars serve as the conceptual framework for this approach. Five main intertextual relations are explored. The recurring metaphorical image is shown to be (1) a semantic link between works of the same author, (2) a manifestation of transpersonal features of imagination, (3) a trace of one author's text in the work of another, (4) a means for establishing hypothetical dialogues between texts which are not related by their authors, and (5) a potential connective between literature and other imaginative systems, such as mythology and visual art. These comparative analyses reveal that intertextual approaches are not only tools for uncovering and enriching the meanings of literary texts; they are also means for constructing order in one's otherwise chaotic corpus of reading, and they enable one to gain knowledge about the nature of imagination. The thematic and methodological aspects of the dissertation thus complement and support each other. </description> <dc:date>2002-07-16T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/228706\"> <title>Turgenev and the question of the Russian artist</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/228706</link> <description>Turgenev and the question of the Russian artist Sundkvist, Luis This thesis is concerned with the thoughts of the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev (1818-83) on the development of the arts in his native country and the specific problems&#13; facing the Russian artist. It starts by considering the state of the creative arts in Russia in the early nineteenth century and suggests why even towards the end of his life Turgenev still had some misgivings as to whether painting and music had become a real necessity for Russian society in the same way that literature clearly had. A re-appraisal of \"On the Eve\" (1860) then follows, indicating how the young sculptor Shubin in this novel acts as the author's alter ego in a number of respects, in particular by reflecting Turgenev's views on&#13; heroism and tragedy. The change in Shubin's attitude towards Insarov, whom the sculptor&#13; at first tries to belittle before eventually comparing him to the noble Brutus in Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\", can be said to anticipate Turgenev's own feelings about&#13; Bazarov in \"Fathers and Children\" (1862) and the way that this 'nihilist' attained the stature of a true tragic hero. In this chapter, too, the clich\\ufffd\\ufffdd notion of Turgenev's alleged affinity with Schopenhauer is firmly challenged \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd an issue that is taken up again later on in the&#13; discussion of \"Phantoms\" (1864) and \"Enough!\" (1865). Other aspects of Turgenev's portrayal of Shubin are used to introduce the remaining chapters, where the problems of dilettantism, originality, nationalism and Slavophilism \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd among the most acute problems which Russian artists had to contend with in Turgenev's eyes \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are explored through various works of his,&#13; especially the novel \"Smoke\" (1867), as well as by reference to his observations of such&#13; contemporaries as Glinka, the painter Ivanov, Tolstoi, and the composers of the 'Mighty Handful'. The springboard for the final chapter on the tragic fate befalling so many Russian artists is once again Shubin, whose voluntary exile in Rome at the end of the novel allows for certain parallels to be drawn with Gogol'. Despite Turgenev's own 'absenteeism' from&#13; Russia, for which he was much reproached, it is emphasized in the conclusion that he&#13; always remained devoted to the cause of Russia's civic and cultural development,&#13; especially in the realm of the arts, whose national, and at the same time universal,&#13; value he upheld so compellingly in his Pushkin speech of 1880. </description> <dc:date>2010-11-16T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/224215\"> <title>Soviet Gothic-fantastic: a study of Gothic and supernatural themes in early Soviet literature</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/224215</link> <description>Soviet Gothic-fantastic: a study of Gothic and supernatural themes in early Soviet literature Maguire, Muireann This thesis analyses the persistence of Gothic-fantastic themes and motifs in the literature of Soviet Russia between 1920 and 1940. &#13; Nineteenth-century Russian literature was characterized by the almost universal assimilation of Gothic-fantastic themes and motifs, adapted from the fiction of Western writers such as E.T.A. Hoffmann, Ann Radcliffe and Edgar Allen Poe. Writers from Pushkin to Dostoevskii, including the major Symbolists, wrote fiction combining the real with the macabre and supernatural. However, following the inauguration of the Soviet regime and the imposition of Socialist Realism as the official literary style in 1934, most critics assumed that the Gothic-fantastic had been expunged from Russian literature. In Konstantin Fedin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds words, the Russian fantastic novel had \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. This thesis argues that Fedin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds dismissal was premature, and presents evidence that Gothic-fantastic themes and motifs continued to play a significant role in several genres of Soviet fiction, including science fiction, satire, comedy, adventure novels (prikliuchenskie romany), and seminal Socialist Realist classics.&#13; My dissertation identifies five categories of Gothic-fantastic themes, derived jointly from analysis of canonical Gothic novels from the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and from innovative approaches to the genre made by contemporary critics such as Fred Botting, Kelly Hurley, Diane Hoeveler, Elaine Showalter and Eric Naiman (whose book Sex in Public coined the phrase \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdNEP Gothic\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). Each chapter analyses one of these five Gothic themes or tropes in the context of selected Soviet Russian literary texts. The chronotope of Gothic space, epitomized in the genre as the haunted castle or house, is readdressed by Mikhail Bulgakov as the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnekhoroshaia kvartira\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of Master i Margarita and by Evgenii Zamiatin as the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddrevnyi dom\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of his dystopian fantasy My. Gothic gender issues, including the subgenre of Female Gothic, arise in Nikolai Ognev\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds novels and Aleksandra Kollontai\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds stories. The Gothic obsession with dying, corpses and the afterlife re-emerges in fictions such as Daniil Kharms\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStarukha\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (whose hero is threatened by an animated corpse) and Nikolai Erdman\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds banned play Samoubiitsa (the story of a failed suicide). Gothic bodies (deformed or regressive human bodies) are contrasted with Stalinist cultural aspirations to somatic perfection within a utopian society. Typically Gothic monsters \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd vampires, ghosts, and demon lovers \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are evaluated in a separate chapter. Each Gothic trope is integrated with my analysis of the relevant Soviet discourse, including early Communist attitudes to gender and the body and the philosopher Nikolai Federov\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds utopian belief in the possibility of universal resurrection.&#13; As my focus is thematic rather than author-centred, my field of research ranges from well-known writers (Fedor Gladkov, Bulgakov, Zamiatin) to virtual unknowns (Grigorii Grebnev and Vsevolod Valiusinskii, both early 1930s novelists), and recently rediscovered writers (Sigizmund Krzhizhanovskii, Vladimir Zazubrin). Three Soviet authors who explicitly emulated the nineteenth-century Gothic-fantastic tradition in their fiction were Mikhail Bulgakov, Sigizmund Krzhizhanovskii and A.V. Chaianov. Many mainstream Soviet writers also exploited Gothic-fantastic motifs in their work. Fedor Gladkov\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Socialist Realist production novel, Tsement, uses the trope of the Gothic castle to dramatise the reclamation of a derelict cement factory by the workers. Nikolai Ognev\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Dnevnik Kosti Riabtseva, the diary of an imaginary Communist schoolboy, relies on ghost stories to sustain suspense. Aleksandr Beliaev, the popular science fiction writer, inserted subversive clich\\ufffd\\ufffds from the Gothic narrative tradition in his deceptively optimistic novels. Gothic-fantastic tropes and motifs were used polemically by dissident writers to subvert the monologic message of Socialist Realism; other writers, such as Gladkov and Marietta Shaginian, exploited the same material to support Communism and attack Russia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds enemies. The visceral resonance of Gothic fear lends its metaphors unique political impact. This dissertation aims at an overall survey of Gothic-fantastic narrative elements in early Soviet literature rather than a conclusive analysis of their political significance. However, in conclusion, I speculate that the survival of the Gothic-fantastic genre in the hostile soil of the Stalinist literary apparatus proves that early Soviet literature was more varied, contradictory and self-interrogative than previously assumed.
