In random&#13; order, diluted (1:5 dilution with saline [154 mmol/l&#13; NaCl]; 20 U/ml) or standard strength (100 U/ml) insulin&#13; aspart was administered via an insulin pump as a meal&#13; bolus and then overnight by closed-loop insulin delivery&#13; as determined by a model predictive algorithm. Plasma&#13; insulin was measured every 30\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd60 min from 17:00 hours&#13; on day 1 to 8:00 hours on day 2. We measured the&#13; time-to-peak insulin concentration (tmax), insulin metabolic&#13; clearance rate (MCRI) and background insulin&#13; concentration (insc) using compartmental modelling.&#13; Results Eleven children (six male; age range 3.75\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd6.96 years,&#13; HbA1c 7.6%\\ufffd\\ufffd1.3% [60\\ufffd\\ufffd14 mmol/mol], BMI standard deviation&#13; score 1.0\\ufffd\\ufffd0.8, duration of diabetes 2.2\\ufffd\\ufffd1.0 years, total&#13; daily dose 12.9 [10.6\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd16.5] U, fasting C-peptide concentration&#13; 5 [5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd17.1] pmol/l; mean\\ufffd\\ufffdSD or median [interquartile&#13; range]) participated in the study. No differences between&#13; standard and diluted insulin were observed in terms of tmax&#13; (59.2\\ufffd\\ufffd14.4 vs 61.6\\ufffd\\ufffd8.7) min for standard vs diluted, p=0.59;&#13; MCRI (1.98\\ufffd\\ufffd10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2\\ufffd\\ufffd0.99\\ufffd\\ufffd10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2 vs 1.89\\ufffd\\ufffd10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2\\ufffd\\ufffd0.82\\ufffd\\ufffd10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2&#13; 1/kg/min, p=0.47), and insc (34 [1\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd72] vs 23 [3\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd65] pmol/l,&#13; p=0.66). However, tmax showed less intersubject variability&#13; following administration of diluted aspart (SD 14.4 vs&#13; 8.7 min, p=0.047).&#13; Conclusions/interpretation Diluting insulin aspart does not&#13; change its pharmacokinetics. However, it may result in less&#13; variable absorption and could be used in young children with&#13; type 1 diabetes undergoing closed-loop insulin delivery.&#13; Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01557634&#13; Funding: Funding was provided by the JDRF, 7th Framework&#13; Programme of the European Union,Wellcome Trust Strategic&#13; Award and the National Institute for Health Research&#13; Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

We combined data collected during free-living unsupervised randomised crossover home studies comparing overnight closed loop and sensor augmented pump therapy.&#13; Materials and methods&#13; 40participants with type 1 diabetes [24 adults (age 43\\ufffd\\ufffd12 years, HbA1c 8.0\\ufffd\\ufffd0.9%; mean\\ufffd\\ufffdSD)and 16 adolescents (15.6\\ufffd\\ufffd3.6 years, HbA1c 8.1\\ufffd\\ufffd0.8%)] underwent two periods of sensor augmented pump therapy at home settings in combination with or without overnight closed-loop utilising model predictive control algorithm to direct insulin delivery. Order of interventions was random; each period lasted four weeks in adults and three weeks in adolescents. Primary outcome was time when sensor glucose was in the target range between 3.9 and 8.0mmol/l. &#13; Results&#13; Proportion of time when sensor glucose was in target range (3.9-8.0mmol/l) between midnight and 08:00 was increased by 18.5% during closed-loop compared to sensor augmented therapy (P&lt;0.001). Closed loop significantly reduced mean overnight glucose by 0.8mmol/l (P&lt;0.001), with no difference in glycaemic variability as measured by the standard deviation of sensor glucose. Time spent above target range was reduced (P=0.001) and so was time spent in hypoglycaemia below 3.9mmol/l (P=0.014) during closed loop. Lower mean overnight glucose during closed loop was brought about by increased overnight insulin delivery (P&lt;0.001) without changing the total daily delivery (P=0.84).&#13; Conclusion&#13; Overnight closed loop at home in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes is feasible, demonstrating improvements in glucose control and reducing the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

In random order, subjects received closed-loop with diluted insulin Aspart (CL_Dil; 20 IU/ml) or closed-loop with standard Aspart (CL_Std; 100IU/ml) from 17:00 until 8:00 the following morning. Children consumed an evening meal at 17:00 [44(12)gCHO] and an optional bedtime snack [6(7)gCHO] identical on both occasions. Meal insulin boluses were calculated by standard pump bolus calculators. Basal rates on insulin pump were adjusted every 15min as directed by a model-predictive-control algorithm informed by a real-time glucose sensor values.  &#13; Results&#13; Mean plasma glucose was 122(24)mg/dl during CL_Dil vs 122(23)mg/dl during CL_Std (p=0.993). The time spent in the target glucose range 70-145mg/dl was 83(70,100)% vs 72(54,81)% (p=0.328). Time above 145mg/dl was 13(0,27)% vs 19(10,45)% (p=0.477) and time spent below 70mg/dl was 0.0(0.0,1.4)% vs 1.4(0.0,11.6)% (p=0.161). One asymptomatic hypoglycemia below 63mg/dl occurred in one subject during CL_Dil vs six episodes in five subjects during CL_Std (p=0.09). Glucose variability measured by CV of plasma glucose tended to be reduced during CL_Dil  [20%(13, 31) vs 32%(24, 42), p=0.075). &#13; Conclusions&#13; In this feasibility study, closed-loop therapy maintained good overnight glucose control with tendency towards reduced hypoglycemia and reduced glucose variability using diluted insulin. &#13; Trial Registration &#13; clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01557634 This is the accepted manuscript.

Objective: Suggested benefits of breast-feeding during infancy, including reduced risk of obesity and improved neurodevelopmental outcomes, remain unexplained but could be mediated by or reflected in lipidomic profiles. We evaluated lipidomic differences between breast- and formula-fed infants.&#13; Study design: We utilised high-resolution mass-spectrometry methods to analyse 3.2 mm dried blood spot samples (DBS) collected at ages 3 months (n=241) and 12 months (n=144) from a representative birth cohort study. Lipidomic profiles were compared between infants exclusively breast-fed, formula-fed or mixed-fed, and related to 12-month infancy weight. Data analysis included supervised multivariate statistics (PLS-DA) and univariate analysis with correction for multiple testing.&#13; Results: Distinct differences in 3-month lipidomic profiles were observed between exclusively breast-fed and formula-fed infants; mixed-fed infants showed intermediate profiles. Principal lipidomic characteristics of breast-fed infants were: lower total phosphatidylcholines (PC), with specifically lower short chain unsaturated PC but higher long chain polyunsaturated PC; higher cholesterol esters; variable differences in sphingomyelins.&#13; At 12 months, lipidomic profiles were markedly different to those at 3 months, and differences between the earlier breast/formula/mixed-feeding groups were no longer evident. However, several specific lipid species, associated with breast-feeding at 3 months, also correlated with differences in 3-12 month weight. &#13; Conclusion: State-of-the-art DBS lipidomic profiling demonstrated striking differences between breast-fed and formula-fed infants. Although these changes diminished with age, breast-fed lipidomic profiles at 3 months were associated with infancy weight and could potentially represent biomarkers of infant nutrition.
