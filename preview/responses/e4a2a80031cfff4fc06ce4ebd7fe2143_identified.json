Although this was a ground breaking result, it was later showed that the atmospheric conditions used in this experiment did not correspond to the ones of our primitive planet.</p> <p>As the Earth was heavily bombarded by comets, asteroids, meteorites and interplanetary dust particle (IDPs) 4.6 to 3.8 million years ago, the exogenous delivery of organic compounds is an alternative. In fact, carbonaceous meteorites have a rich organic inventory, and may have provided the first building blocks of life to the primitive Earth. As future space missions will investigate the possibility of past and/or present extra-terrestrial life, it is important to determine how life may have originated in other places of our solar system, and how to detect possible bio-signatures.</p> <p>This talk will discuss how the study of meteorites, asteroids, comets and Mars soil analogues is used to investigate the origin of life on Earth and how to detect any possible signatures of extra-terrestrial life in our solar system.</p> <p><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/public-events/research-lectures/zita-martins/research-lecture-zita-martins-flyer\">Flyer for this event</a></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <h2 class=\" \">Dr Zita Martins<img style=\"float: right; \" alt=\"Zita Martins_profile\" class=\"image-inline\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/assets/ZitaMartins.jpg/@@images/292810ad-3c84-441c-a64c-ab01cecf99ef.jpeg\" title=\"Zita Martins_profile\" /></h2> <p>Dr Zita Martins is a Royal Society University\\ufffd\\ufffdResearch Fellow at Imperial College London. Her research interests include the detection of bio-signatures in space missions, and the possible contribution of meteorites and comets to the origin of life on Earth. Dr Zita Martins has an MSc in Chemistry from Instituto Superior T\\ufffd\\ufffdcnico (Portugal, 2003) and a PhD in Astrobiology from the University of Leiden (The Netherlands, 2007). She was an Invited Scientist at NASA Goddard in 2005 and 2006, and an Invited Professor at the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis (France) in 2012. After her PhD, Dr Martins moved to Imperial College London as Post-Doc Research Associate, and since 2009 she has been a Royal Society University Research Fellow.</p> <p>Dr Martins is a Co-Investigator in one European Space Agency (ESA-ELIPS) space mission experiment (OREOCube) which will be on-board the International Space Station, a member of two ESA Topical Teams (<i>Future Astrobiology Experiments in Earth orbit and beyond, </i>and<i> Lunar Exploitation of local planetary materials)</i>, and a Committee member of the Astrobiology Society of Britain (ASB). She has been an invited speaker in several international conferences including the Gordon Research Conference and the COSPAR Conference. Dr Martins has an active involvement with public outreach activities, including several international media interviews, and public talks at museums and Science festivals. She was selected as one of the BBC's Expert Women, and she had the honour of having her portrait sketched for the Royal Society exhibit about great women in science.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>lr158</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Sciences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biological Sciences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Event</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Astrophysics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Event:Lecture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Interdisciplinary science</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-20T17:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/march/scientists-solve-decades-old-space-mystery\">     <title>Scientists solve decades old space mystery</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/march/scientists-solve-decades-old-space-mystery</link>     <description>New theory advanced for how collapsed stars become polluted \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd pointing to ominous fate that awaits planet Earth </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2014/march/scientists-solve-riddle-of-celestial-archaeology\"><dl class=\"image-left captioned\" style=\"width:200px;\"> <dt><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/2014/white-dwarf/@@images/158b1df3-e9ad-4827-921f-4dcfc89dbe4e.jpeg\" alt=\"White Dwarf\" title=\"White Dwarf\" height=\"160\" width=\"200\" /></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:200px;\">Artist\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds impression of a massive asteroid belt in orbit around a star.

<p>The analyser will allow rapid mineral identification and quantification in the field through a combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and will be capable of analysing mining samples for mineral content within 1 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 2 minutes.</p> <p>The analyser is unique due to the insensitivity of the technique to the shape of the sample, which enables the direct analysis of samples without any form of preparation \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd something currently inconceivable using conventional XRD equipment.</p> <p>Dr Hansford originally conceived of the XRD technique in early 2010, when trying to work out how to apply XRD for space applications - for example on the surface of Mars or an asteroid - without the need for any sample preparation.</p> <p>This

The project recently took him to the Atacama desert of Northern Chile, where a prototype Mars rover equipped with sophisticated instruments was used to simulate a mission to the red planet.</p> <p>Dr Pullan provided scientific input to the project, initially to help select a suitable site that had maximum geological realism for the trial and also to provide in-field expertise during the trial itself. Importantly, suitable sites for these type of tests must \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlook like Mars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, be large-scale, uncontrolled, exhibit natural geological features, be free of vegetation, show no signs of human activity (including footprints!) and have stable weather (no chance of rain). Candidate sites in Chile, Morocco, Tenerife and the USA were originally evaluated but the team settled on Chile thanks to all the above criteria being met plus the added bonus of local support offered by ESO at the Paranal observatory close to the test site.</p> <p>The SAFER project is led by the technological partners <a href=\"http://www.stfc.ac.uk/ralspace/default.aspx\">RAL Space</a> (project lead), <a href=\"http://www.astrium.eads.net/\">EADS Astrium</a> (rover platform) and <a href=\"http://www.scisys.co.uk/\">SCISYS</a> (mission operations software), and is a follow-on to a project called <a href=\"http://www.stfc.ac.uk/RALSpace/Areas+of+expertise/Technology/Robotics/38488.aspx\">SEEKER</a>, which developed robust long range navigation software for the next generation of Mars rovers. With the inclusion of science (University of Leicester), a payload of instruments (UK, France and Switzerland) and remotely operated via a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMission Control\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the UK, SAFER provides a more realistic framework in which to learn how to prepare for real missions to Mars.</p> <p>To keep track of developments relating to SAFER, visit the <a

in their cores.</span></p> <p class=\" \"><span> </span><span>Her work particularly focuses on brown dwarfs in close binaries with white dwarfs \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd very dense remnants of low to medium mass stars which have reached the end of their life cycle.</span></p> <p class=\" \"><span> </span><span>Her expertise in this area made her an ideal person to provide commentary for the New

white dwarf while the other side remains cool.</span></p> <p class=\" \"><span> </span><span>This can produce dramatic weather phenomena according to Dr Casewell \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd including
