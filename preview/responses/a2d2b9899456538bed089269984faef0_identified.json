No facilities are available with large fetches and correspondingly high wave ages. Furthermore almost no large facility is suitable for measurements with sea water,&lt;br /&gt; is clean enough for controllable experiments with surface films or sufficiently&lt;br /&gt; gastight for gas exchange measurements. Currently a new large annular wind/wave facility with quasi unlimited fetch is under construction at the Institute for Environmental Physics of Heidelberg University. An annular facility is not a new idea. A 40 m diameter facility (&amp;ldquo;storm basin&amp;rdquo;) was already built shortly after World War II in Sevastopol for wind/wave interaction studies. Various small circular facilities for air-sea gas exchange studies have been used since the late 70ties at Heidelberg University and later at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for air-sea gas exchange studies.&lt;/p&gt;</ab>   <la/>   <k1>Aeolotron;                 gas exchange;                 wind-wave facility;                 </k1>   <pb/>   <pp/>   <yr>1999-01-11</yr>   <ed/>   <ul>https://zenodo.org/record/14857/files/ASI1999_PosterAeolotrron_Jaehne_et_al_a.pdf;  </ul>   <no>Imported from Invenio.</no> </reference>   </references>",
