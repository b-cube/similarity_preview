Genome-wide association studies of the related chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) known as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis have shown strong evidence of association to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This region encodes a large number of immunological candidates, including the antigen-presenting classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules1. Studies in IBD have indicated that multiple independent associations exist at HLA and non-HLA genes, but they have lacked the statistical power to define the architecture of association and causal alleles2, 3. To address this, we performed high-density SNP typing of the MHC in &gt;32,000 individuals with IBD, implicating multiple HLA alleles, with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03 in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Noteworthy differences were observed between these diseases, including a predominant role for class II HLA variants and heterozygous advantage observed in ulcerative colitis, suggesting an important role of the adaptive immune response in the colonic environment in the pathogenesis of IBD.

We determined whether assessment of the immunogenicity of individual donor-recipient HLA&#13; mismatches based on differences in their amino acid sequence and physiochemical properties predicts&#13; clinical outcomes following haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We examined patients&#13; transplanted with 9/10 single HLA class I mismatched grafts (n=171) and 10/10 HLA-A,-B,-C,-DRB1,-29 DQB1 matched grafts (n=168). A computer algorithm was used to determine the physiochemical&#13; disparity (Electrostatic and Hydrophobic Mismatch Scores, EMS and HMS) of mismatched HLA class&#13; I specificities in the graft-versus-host direction. Patients transplanted with HLA mismatched grafts with&#13; high EMS/HMS had increased incidence of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd grade-II acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD)&#13; compared to patients transplanted with low EMS/HMS grafts; patients transplanted with low and&#13; medium EMS/HMS grafts had similar incidence of aGvHD to patients transplanted with 10/10 HLA&#13; matched grafts. Mortality was higher following single HLA mismatched HSCT but was not correlated&#13; with HLA physiochemical disparity. Assessment of donor-recipient HLA incompatibility based on&#13; physiochemical HLA disparity may enable better selection of HLA mismatched donors in&#13; haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.

We have now used a novel computational approach to quantitate differences in surface electrostatic potential of HLA B-cell epitopes, and applied this to explain HLA Bw4 and Bw6 antigenicity.&#13; &#13; Methods: Protein structure models of HLA class I alleles expressing either the Bw4 or Bw6 epitope (defined by sequence motifs at positions 77-83) were generated using comparative structure prediction. The electrostatic potential in three-dimensional space encompassing the Bw4/Bw6 epitope was computed by solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation and quantitatively compared in a pairwise, all-versus-all, fashion to produce distance matrices that cluster epitopes with similar electrostatics properties.&#13; &#13; Results: Quantitative comparison of surface electrostatic potential at the carboxyl terminal of the \\ufffd\\ufffd1-helix of HLA class I alleles, corresponding to amino acid sequence motif 77-83, produced clustering of HLA molecules in three principal groups according to Bw4 or Bw6 epitope expression. Remarkably, quantitative differences in electrostatic potential reflected known patterns of serological reactivity better than Bw4/Bw6 amino acid sequence motifs. Quantitative assessment of epitope electrostatic potential allowed the impact of known amino acid substitutions (HLA-B*07:02 R79G, R82L, G83R) that are critical for antibody binding to be predicted.&#13; &#13; Conclusion: We describe a novel approach for quantitating differences in HLA B-cell epitope electrostatic potential. Proof of principle is provided that this approach enables better assessment of HLA epitope antigenicity than amino acid sequence data alone and it may allow prediction of HLA immunogenicity.

Nine fourth year student\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddoctors and four clinicians also participated in semi-structured interviews. The combination of observations, audio-recordings, transcriptions, field notes, and interview data allowed us to produce a detailed description of the case.&#13; &#13; Results: Each bedside episode offered opportunities for learning about clinical communication. However, the student\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddoctors did not always recognise that they were learning about clinical communication, since in this context, they were not being explicitly taught about communication. Student\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddoctors were rarely invited to participate in the ward-round and clinicians overlooked opportunities for learning. Some student\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddoctors questioned the educational value of ward-rounds and did not always attend.&#13; &#13; Conclusions: Ward-rounds are a rich site for learning clinical communication but opportunities for learning are often overlooked.&#13; &#13; Practice implications: By being alert to the power of role modelling and the importance of inclusion and participation, student\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddoctors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd learning of clinical communication can be enhanced even on busy ward rounds.
