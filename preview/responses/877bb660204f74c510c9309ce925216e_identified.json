Respondents were asked to give their  opinions of New York City, with specific respect to Mayor Michael  Bloomberg's handling of New York City-specific events and issues  (e.g., the city's recovery efforts following the terrorist attacks on  the World Trade Center and getting help from the national government  for New York City). Opinions on other national figures -- e.g., George  W. Bush, Rudolph Giuliani, John McCain, and Arnold Schwarzenegger --  were solicited as well. Additional survey questions queried  respondents' feelings about New York City (e.g., quality of life, the  economy, others' image of the city, and security), the Republican  National Convention to be held in the city, and post-9/11 changes they  had experienced (e.g., losing sleep, losing a job, or losing a close  friend or relative). Background information includes voter  registration status, political party affiliation, New York City  borough of residence, sex, education, age, marital status, ethnicity, and income.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"2004-08\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-08</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2004-08-20\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-08-20</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2004-08-25\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-08-25</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>New York City</geogCover>             <geogCover>New York (state)</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adult population of the United States aged 18 and over having a telephone at home.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A variation of random-digit dialing using primary sampling  units (PSUs) was employed, consisting of blocks of 100 telephone  numbers identical through the eighth digit and stratified by  geographic region, area code, and size of place. Within households,  respondents were selected using a method developed by Leslie Kish and  modified by Charles Backstrom and Gerald Hursh (see Backstrom and  Hursh, SURVEY RESEARCH. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1963).          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          telephone interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 (1) The data contain weight variables that should be  used for analysis.
