The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such             as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these             smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this             hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data             respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins, Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the             WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html. The USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) service is a companion dataset to the WBD.             The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies             of surface water (lakes, ponds, and reservoirs), paths through which water flows (canals, ditches, streams, and rivers), and             related entities such as point features (springs, wells, stream gages, and dams). The information encoded about these features             includes classification and other characteristics, delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\"             through which other information can be related to the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes             delineating water and transported material flow allows users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In             addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and             improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and             referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on 1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD.             Additional selected areas in the United States are available based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and             referred to as local resolution NHD. For more information on the NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html. Hydrography data             from The National Map supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance,             and stewardship. Hydrography data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and             transportation, to produce general reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads of public domain WBD and             NHD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase, or Shapefile formats.</abstract>          <purpose>The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of subdividing             large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 40,000 acres) are useful for numerous application             programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended to be used as a tool for             water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of             detail provided by large-scale map information. The dataset will be appended to a larger seamless nationally consistant             geospatial database as other states complete their portion of the watershed boundary dataset.</purpose>          <supplinf>This set of data contains hydrologic unit boundaries of various types or levels, including watershed and             subwatershed.</supplinf>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>2014</begdate>                <enddate>present</enddate>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current>publication date</current>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>Complete</progress>          <update>Irregular</update>       </status>       <spdom>          <bounding>             <westbc>-179.229655487448</westbc>             <eastbc>179.856674735386</eastbc>             <northbc>71.4395725901531</northbc>             <southbc>-14.4246950942767</southbc>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>             <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>             <themekey>boundaries</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>NGDA Portfolio Themes</themekt>             <themekey>National Geospatial Data Asset</themekey>             <themekey>NGDA</themekey>             <themekey>Water Inland Theme</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>Geospatial Platform</themekt>             <themekey>ngda</themekey>             <themekey>Watershed Boundaries</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>None</themekt>             <themekey>Administrative watershed units</themekey>             <themekey>Sub-region</themekey>             <themekey>Watershed</themekey>             <themekey>HUC</themekey>             <themekey>Subwatershed</themekey>             <themekey>Sub-basin</themekey>             <themekey>Watershed Boundary Dataset</themekey>             <themekey>Watershed Boundaries</themekey>             <themekey>boundaries</themekey>             <themekey>Hydrologic Unit Code</themekey>             <themekey>Basin</themekey>             <themekey>WBD</themekey>             <themekey>Region</themekey>             <themekey>Hydrologic Units</themekey>             <themekey>Topographic</themekey>             <themekey>Boundary</themekey>             <themekey>Hydrography</themekey>             <themekey>HU10</themekey>             <themekey>HU12</themekey>             <themekey>HU14</themekey>             <themekey>HU16</themekey>             <themekey>HU2</themekey>             <themekey>HU4</themekey>             <themekey>HU6</themekey>             <themekey>HU8</themekey>             <themekey>Hydrographic</themekey>             <themekey>Line</themekey>             <themekey>Point</themekey>             <themekey>PointEvent</themekey>             <themekey>Region</themekey>             <themekey>Subbasin</themekey>             <themekey>Subregion</themekey>             <themekey>Subwatershed</themekey>             <themekey>topographic</themekey>             <themekey>Watershed</themekey>             <themekey>Boundaries</themekey>             <themekey>Administrative watershed units</themekey>             <themekey>Basin</themekey>             <themekey>Drainage areas for surface water</themekey>             <themekey>drainage systems and characteristics</themekey>          </theme>          <place>             <placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt>             <placekey>US</placekey>             <placekey>United States</placekey>          </place>          <place>             <placekt>The National Map Place Thesaurus</placekt>             <placekey>US</placekey>          </place>       </keywords>       <accconst>None</accconst>       <useconst>The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of          appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired          from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be          used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in 7. 5          should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The 7 Watershed Boundary Dataset is public          information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are          responsible for the appropriate application of the data.

The Natural Resources Conservation Service will          not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital          enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of          the data.

In this product, the                projection line, grids, and orthoimage are believed to meet NMAS.
