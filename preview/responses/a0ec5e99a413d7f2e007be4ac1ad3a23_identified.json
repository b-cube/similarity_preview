Authors: Cairney, Paul; Studlar, Donley T Abstract: The United Kingdom now has one of the most comprehensive tobacco control policies in the world, a far cry from its status two decades ago. Some influential public health voices have called for a similar campaign against alcohol consumption. But is the comparison appropriate? We identify the factors which were important in the relatively successful campaign for tobacco control, then analyze the obstacles and opportunities facing the movement for more stringent alcohol control. Alcohol policy today often bears a striking resemblance to tobacco policy pre-1990s, when the UK started on its path to becoming a leading regulatory on this policy.</description>     <dc:date>2014-09-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21599\">     <title>Archaeometallurgical studies on the slags of the Middle Bronze Age copper smelting site S1, Styria, Austria</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21599</link>     <description>Title: Archaeometallurgical studies on the slags of the Middle Bronze Age copper smelting site S1, Styria, Austria Authors: Kraus, Steffen; Schr\\ufffd\\ufffdder, Christian; Klemm, Susanne; Pernicka, Ernst Editors: Hauptmann, A; Modarressi-Tehrani, D Abstract: The copper smelting site S1 in the Eisenerzer Ramsau Valley, Styria, is the largest Bronze Age copper smelting site excavated in the Eastern Alps. The site was almost completely excavated from 1992 to 2006 and ten roasting hearths, six double furnaces, a number of pits of variable size, form and function, and three separate slag dumps have been recorded. The use of this smelting site covers the whole period of the Middle Bronze Age from the 16th to the 13th century BC and might extend as far as the 11th century BC. The aim of this archaeometallurgical study is the reconstruction of the smelting process at this site and the discovery of possible diachronic changes or developments in the technology of smelting during the different phases of use. Therefore slags of the different archaeological phases were analysed for their chemical and mineralogical composition. A few slags were analysed with M\\ufffd\\ufffdssbauer spectroscopy to obtain further information about the conditions during the smelting process. The results of the analyses show that nearly all slags belong to one particular step of the smelting process which was the production of raw copper or copper matte under reducing conditions at temperatures around 1250 \\ufffd\\ufffdC.</description>     <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21598\">     <title>Structural Coherence of Problem and Algorithm: An Analysis for EDAs on all 2-bit and 3-bit Problems</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21598</link>     <description>Title: Structural Coherence of Problem and Algorithm: An Analysis for EDAs on all 2-bit and 3-bit Problems Authors: Brownlee, Alexander; McCall, John; Christie, Lee Abstract: Metaheuristics assume some kind of coherence between decision and objective spaces. Estimation of Distribution algorithms approach this by constructing an explicit probabilistic model of high fitness solutions, the structure of which is intended to reflect the structure of the problem. In this context, ``structure'' means the dependencies or interactions between problem variables in a probabilistic graphical model. There are many approaches to discovering these dependencies, and existing work has already shown that often these approaches discover ``unnecessary'' elements of structure - that is, elements which are not needed to correctly rank solutions. This work performs an exhaustive analysis of all 2 and 3 bit problems, grouped into classes based on mononotic invariance. It is shown in (Christie, 2014) that each class has a minimal Walsh structure that can be used to solve the problem. We compare the structure discovered by different structure learning approaches to the minimal Walsh structure for each class, with summaries of which interactions are (in)correctly identified. Our analysis reveals a large number of symmetries that may be used to simplify problem solving. We show that negative selection can result in improved coherence between discovered and necessary structure, and conclude with some directions for a general programme of study building on this work.</description>     <dc:date>2015-05-25T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21375\">     <title>Revealing the hidden niches of cryptic bumblebees in Great Britain: implications for conservation</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/1893/21375</link>     <description>Title: Revealing the hidden niches of cryptic bumblebees in Great Britain: implications for conservation Authors: Scriven, Jessica; Woodall, Lucy; Tinsley, M C; Knight, Mairi E; Williams, Paul H; Carolan, James; Brown, Mark J F; Goulson, Dave Abstract: Bumblebees are ecologically and economically important, and some species have suffered dramatic population declines. The absence of morphological diagnostic characters for the identification of some species creates difficulties for basic ecological studies, and for conservation management. The widespread and commercially exploited bumblebee subgenus Bombus sensu stricto contains a cryptic species complex, known as the lucorum complex, which in Europe comprises B. lucorum, B. cryptarum and B. magnus. Little is known about these species and much of what has been reported is likely to have suffered from incorrect identification. Although the lucorum complex as a whole is common in Great Britain, we aimed to determine whether the populations of the individual species are vulnerable and require conservation action. Using genetic methods to distinguish them, we determined the geographic distribution and abundance of the lucorum complex species in Great Britain, and assessed the extent of niche differentiation between these species. We detected major differences in the geographic range, forage use and sensitivity to summer temperatures of the three species. Bombus lucorum was found to have the broadest distribution and diet, being present throughout mainland Great Britain, whereas B. cryptarum and B. magnus were absent from large areas of central and southern England. Bombus cryptarum and B. magnus were more likely to be found at sites with lower summer temperatures. Bombus magnus, the least abundant species, was found to exhibit an unusually tight biotope association with heathland habitat. This has conservation implications for B. magnus given the current threats to this habitat type.</description>     <dc:date>2015-02-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
