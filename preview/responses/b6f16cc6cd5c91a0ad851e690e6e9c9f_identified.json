The dataset runs from the breeding season in 1993 to the end of the breeding season in 2014. The first egg dates are presented as the number days from the start date which was set as the 1st April each year. Because the breeding of greats tits and blue tits is influenced in large part by ambient temperature and the phenology of their main prey, the data were collected as a measure spring phenology. These data comprise part of a larger long-term study of the influence of habitat (extent, structure and composition) and landscape factors on abundance, distribution and breeding success of woodland birds in English lowland deciduous woodland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cambridgeshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monks Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brampton Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wennington Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>blue tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Parus major</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cyanistes caeruleus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>breeding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deciduous woodland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable land management (en)</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-10T12:37:18Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b0c4358-2bf3-4924-aa8f-793d468b92be\">     <title>High-resolution global topographic index values</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b0c4358-2bf3-4924-aa8f-793d468b92be</link>     <description>The topographic index is a hydrological quantity describing the propensity of the soil at landscape points to become saturated with water as a result of topographic position (i.e. not accounting for other factors such as climate that also affect soil moisture but are accounted for separately). Modern land surface models require a characterisation of the land surface hydrological regime and this parameter allows the use of the TOPMODEL hydrological model to achieve this .This Geographic Information System layer is intended for use as topographic ancillary files for the TOPMODEL routing model option within the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. The topographic index variable here is directly comparable to the compound topographic index available from United States Geological Survey's Hydro1K at 30 sec resolution.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey in each of those years, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as the estimated mean length of linear features (hedgerows, walls, fences, banks, grass strips and tree lines) per 1km square within 45 different Land Class types based on the ITE Land Classification.  The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedgerows</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-10T14:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d774f98f-030d-45bb-8042-7729573a13b2\">     <title>Biodiversity, environmental and social data 2007-2008 for the project Improving the Success of Agri-environment Schemes (FarmCAT)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d774f98f-030d-45bb-8042-7729573a13b2</link>     <description>This dataset consists of butterfly and bumblebee counts, winter bird counts, number of flowering units, and seed mass data, along with categories of soil type and quality, and temperature data. Data were collected from arable farms under the English Entry Level agri-environment Scheme (ELS) for two options: Nectar Flower Mixture option (NFM) and Wild Bird Seed Mixture (WBM). Surveys were carried out in 2007 and repeated in 2008. All data were collected using standardised protocols: butterfly and bumblebee counts were collected from transects in the NFM options during summer; flowering units were counted within quadrats along the same transects in summer; bird counts were made in winter within the whole WBM areas; seed resource was calculated for the WBM areas from seeds collected in quadrats along transects.  The dataset also contains results from farmer interviews. The interviews were designed to explore farmer attitudes towards, and history of, environmental management and their perceptions and understanding of the management requirements. Three measures of farmer attitude were then calculcated from their responses: experience (4-point scale), concerns (5-point scale) and motivation (3-point scale).  All data were collected as part of the FarmCAT project, the principal aim of which was to develop a holistic understanding of the social and ecological factors which lead to the successful delivery of agri-environmental schemes. This project was funded as part of the ESRC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter birds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bumblebees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>flowers</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>seeds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>agri-environment schemes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>AES</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nectar Flower Mixture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EF4</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wild Bird Seed Mixture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EF2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>environmental management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-06T15:36:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a384bdfb-0bf2-4c3e-80ab-e171f38d503d\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from transects within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, between 2010 and 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a384bdfb-0bf2-4c3e-80ab-e171f38d503d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, between 2010-2011. A long term landscape scale grassland restoration and re-creation project has been underway at the site since 2000). 200m long transects located in the centre of different grassland re-creation fields of different ages, arable land, chalk grassland fragments on slopes and on ancient burial mounds, and semi-improved pasture. Transects were surveyed on three occasions spread across the field season (June to September), and throughout the day and were selected ad-hoc for survey in order to minimise the effect that the time of year and day would have on results. During the survey, the transect was walked at a slow, steady pace allowing five minutes for each 20m section of transect and the number and species of Lepidoptera present 5m either side and ahead were recorded. If Lepidoptera were observed feeding, then the nectar plant species was also recorded. Habitat quality, defined in terms of vegetation characteristics and nectar resources, was quantified throughout each transect by sampling quadrats in each 20m segment of the transect. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae). The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the National Trust.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>day flying moths</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland restoration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wiltshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stonehenge</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-30T09:12:02Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from chalk grassland fragment boundaries within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, in 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera from chalk grassland fragments at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, in 2011. The landscape consists of small fragments of ancient chalk grassland on slopes and groups of burial mounds (barrows) which have retained many of the characteristic chalk grassland plant and butterfly species. Surveys were located at four of these chalk grassland fragments. At each chalk grassland fragment, four 20 m long survey boundaries, were set up on boundaries with adjacent land cover of either arable land or new grassland re-creation sown in the years 2009 or 2010. Control surveys were also carried out in areas of continuous habitat within the chalk grassland fragment and in the adjoining land cover type. Surveys of Lepidoptera behaviour were carried out from May to July between 10am and 4pm and effort was taken to survey the same site at different times of the day in order to minimise the effect of survey time on behaviour. Standing at the chalk grassland fragment edge the flight path of individual Lepidoptera was tracked in the survey area for up to three minutes. Measures of vegetation characteristics and nectar flower availability were recorded for each plot. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae).

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from up to 591 1km squares and scaling up to a national level. The data are summarized as percentage increase or decrease in habitat area per Land Class (areas of similar environmental characteristics) and are in a vector format. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB and using the 'ITE Land Classification' as a method of stratification. The data were collected as part of Countryside Survey, a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978 by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. In addition to habitat areas, vegetation species data, soil data, linear habitat data, and freshwater habitat data are also gathered by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Broad Habitats</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T11:26:03Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e54069b6-71a9-4b36-837f-a5e3ee65b4de\">     <title>Arable crop yield data for the Hillesden Experimental Platform, UK, collected between 2006 and 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e54069b6-71a9-4b36-837f-a5e3ee65b4de</link>     <description>This dataset contains yield data for wheat, oilseed rape and field beans grown in fields under different agri-environment practices. The fields were located at the Hillesden Estate in Buckinghamshire, UK, where a randomised block experiment had been implemented to examine the effects of converting differing proportions of arable land to wildlife habitat. The fields were planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) followed by break crops of either oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) or field beans (Vicia faba L.). Three treatments were applied at random: a control (\"business as usual\"), Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) treatment and ELS Extra treatment. The ELS treatment involved removing 1% of land to create wildlife habitats. The ELS Extra had a greater proportion of land removed (6%) and additional wildlife habitats included. The total yield of each crop was measured at the time of harvesting using a yield meter attached to the combine harvester. From these values, yield per hectare and the ratio of crop yield to regional average yield were calculated.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>OSR</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>field beans</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter wheat</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brassica napus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vicia faba</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Triticum aestivum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hillesden</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Buckinghamshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T10:48:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7e2981e7-bd4c-4992-b7b0-1b1253bfd20d\">     <title>Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1990,1998 and 2007</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7e2981e7-bd4c-4992-b7b0-1b1253bfd20d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of change data for areas of Broad Habitats across Great Britain between 1990 and 1998, between 1990 and 2007, and between 1998 and 2007.
