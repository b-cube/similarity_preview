In 1824, he married Marinda Adkins, and the couple had eleven children,     including Thomas Eskridge (1832-1901) and Sebron Graham, Jr. (1836-1894). Moving to     Fayetteville, Arkansas, in 1830, Sneed opened a law partnership with Williamson     Simpson Oldham. He also served as the Fayetteville district\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds prosecuting attorney     (1831-1833), registrar of the United States Land Office (1839), district judge of     Fayetteville District Court (1839), and judge of the Fourth Judicial District Court     (1844-1848). </p>    <p>In 1848, the family moved to Austin, Texas, where Sneed helped organize the Travis     County Democratic Party in 1857. The following year, he and William M. Walton formed     a law firm, which Sneed\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds son Thomas later joined. At the beginning of the Civil     War, after the law firm dissolved, Thomas and Sebron, Jr., joined the Confederate     Army, while Sneed, Sr., served as a Confederate provost marshal and volunteered his     home as a recruiting station and military hospital. After the war, Sneed operated a     farm until his death in 1879.</p>    <p>Source:</p>    <p>Koch, Mary Wilcox. <title render=\"doublequote\">Sneed, Sebron Graham.</title>     <title render=\"italic\">Handbook of Texas Online</title>.
