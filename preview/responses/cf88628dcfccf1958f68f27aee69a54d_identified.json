Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.</abstract> <purpose>The mission of the National Ocean Service, Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services is to provide the national infrastructure, and the scientific and technical expertise to monitor, assess, and distribute tide, current, water level, and other coastal oceanographic products and services necessary to support NOAA's mission. An important aspect of this mission is promoting safe navigation and improving the efficiency of the maritime industry and the economic productivity of U.S. ports by providing real-time current observations, predictions, forecast, and other coastal oceanographic information</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>1840</begdate> <enddate>Present</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>In work</progress> <update>Continually</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-168.3</westbc> <eastbc>-67.3</eastbc> <northbc>70.4</northbc> <southbc>29.4</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>tidal currents</themekey> <themekey>current</themekey> <themekey>currents</themekey> <themekey>flood current</themekey> <themekey>ebb current</themekey> <themekey>observations</themekey> <themekey>safe navigation</themekey> <themekey>navigation</themekey> <themekey>coast</themekey> <themekey>ports</themekey> <themekey>Tides/Currents</themekey> <themekey>oceans</themekey> <themekey>Tides and Currents</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>oceans</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>NOS Data Explorer Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>Tides and Currents</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Coastal United States</placekey> <placekey>San Francisco Bay</placekey> <placekey>Tampa Bay</placekey> <placekey>New York/New Jersey Harbor</placekey> <placekey>Chesapeake Bay</placekey> <placekey>Los Angeles/ Long Beach</placekey> <placekey>Houston/Galveston</placekey> <placekey>Narragansett Bay</placekey> <placekey>Delaware River and Bay</placekey> <placekey>Soo Locks</placekey> <placekey>Port of Anchorage</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>Preliminary data have not been subjected to the National Ocean Service's quality control or quality assurance procedures and do not meet the criteria and standards of official National Ocean Service data.

The Stand-Alone ADP instrument uses an external power supply and outputs serial data that can be captured or relayed. It is commonly used for monitoring currents near underwater structures such as piers. They are also used for 2D vertical profiling in narrow channels to avoid interference with channel walls. Accuracy: +/- 0.5 cm/s speed; +/- 2 degrees direction.RD Instruments manufactured the Workhorse Monitor Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) to measure water currents. It is usually bottom mounted and stores it's data internally. The instrument is retrieved after a certain amount of time and the data is downloaded to a PC where it is processed and loaded into a database. Accuracy: +/- 0.5 cm/s speed; +/- 2 degrees direction.</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Ocean Service (NOS), Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntpos>CO-OPS, Products and Services Division</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>1305 East West Highway N/OPS</address> <city>Silver Spring</city> <state>MD</state> <postal>20190</postal> <country>U.S.A.</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>301-713-2981</cntvoice> <cnttdd>301-713-0296</cnttdd> <cntfax>301-713-4392</cntfax> <cntemail>co-ops.userservices@noaa.gov</cntemail> <hours>0900 - 1700, Monday to Friday, EST</hours> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc> <distliab>Preliminary data have not been subjected to the National Ocean Service's quality control or quality assurance procedures and do not meet the criteria and standards of official National Ocean Service data.
