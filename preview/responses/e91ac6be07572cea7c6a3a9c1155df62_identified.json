applies real scientific principles to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdoff the wall\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd subjects</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><b>Issued by University of Leicester Press Office on 11 March </b></p> <p> <p>Four University of Leicester physics students have co-written a paper which highlights a problematic concept when planning a human colony on Mars.</p> </p> <p>Colonising the Red Planet is exactly the kind of goal that the privately funded Mars One programme has set for itself and hopes to achieve by 2025.</p> <p>It has recently announced the penultimate stage of its colonist selection programme.</p> <p>So undergraduates Alex Longman, 22, Kieran Flatt, 21, Sam Turnpenney, 32, and Maria Garreffa, 22, got together to look at the possibility of terraforming Mars in preparation for its first human settlers.</p> <p>As part of a course module which invites them to consider alternative and off-the-wall suggestions based on real scientific principles, the groups looked at burning copious amounts of coal on Mars to create enough carbon dioxide to alter the Martian atmosphere.</p> <p>The process would increase the atmospheric density and eliminate the need for pressurised spacesuits \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd making the Red Planet more habitable.</p> <p>However, the group performed some short calculations to demonstrate that, unsurprisingly, there are some major difficulties with this proposal.</p> <p>Lead author Alex said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe paper found that terraforming Mars was unfeasible and unlikely to happen any time soon due to the large values of coal being needed to produce a greenhouse effect.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis means that the Mars One explorers require the present need for pressure spacesuits to live on Mars due to its hostile environment.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis reminds us of how unfriendly Mars is compared to Earth and a fact the Mars One explorers would need to be aware of before going.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The group found that the problem is not the amount of coal itself, but the transportation logistics of such a large quantity.</p> <p>They calculated that using the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds most powerful rocket, the SpaceX Falcon Heavy, it would take 2,390,000,000,000,000 trips to ship the required amount.</p> <p>Alex said there are also other issues with colonisation, including being exposed to dangerous cosmic rays.</p> <p>He said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere would also be the problem of radiation from the sun and our solar system when travelling to Mars for around 300 days.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCosmic rays can damage the DNA of the Mars One explorers which could lead to cancer or other diseases although this can be lessened by shielding the spacecraft.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSecondly, the Mars surface is hostile to life. It too receives large amounts of radiation due to a lack of a magnetic field as well as being extremely cold, a low pressure atmosphere and having potential problems of Martian dust.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis could create health problems if inhaled, damage electronics through charge build up and contaminate the Mars One habitat.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Course tutor Dr Mervyn Roy said although the concepts conceived as part of the special topics were often rather abstract, it gave students valuable experience when it came to writing academic papers.</p> <p>He said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAs part of the physics special topics module students are encouraged to use simple physics to investigate problems that are a bit unusual, and need some estimation, approximation, and imagination to solve.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWhen students are thinking up new problems they\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre always creative \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds great to see them take inspiration from something as exciting as the Mars One programme.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Ends</b></p> <p><b>NOTE TO EDITORS:</b></p> <p><b>For more information contact student Alex Longman via <a href=\"mailto:whal1@student.le.ac.uk\">whal1@student.le.ac.uk</a></b></p> <p>Course tutor, Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer in the University of Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Department of Physics and Astronomy, can be contacted via: <a href=\"mailto:mr6@le.ac.uk\">mr6@le.ac.uk</a><br /><br />Please note:</p> <ul> <li>The papers that the students write are often based on very short calculations. </li> <li>The important things for the module are not the calculations or the new results - it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds that students are thinking of new problems, trying to communicate their solutions, and judging the quality of other students\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd work.

They include academics in areas as diverse as Medicine, Engineering, Archaeology and Education, as well as highly achieving members of the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds professional services and administration.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The gallery will be revealed today at an awards ceremony at the University, introduced by President and Vice-Chancellor Professor Paul Boyle and with a speech by Dr Angela Lennox, University of Leicester academic and Associate Medical Director for NHS England. Fitness entrepreneur Rosemary Conley will give closing remarks for the event.</p> <p>Staff at the University were invited to celebrate the achievements of women at Leicester by nominating candidates who work or have a link with the University.\\ufffd\\ufffd Over sixty nominations were received.</p> <p>The twelve selected nominations are:</p> <ul> <li>Professor Liz Anderson (Department of Medical and Social Care Education)</li> <li>Professor Helen Atkinson CBE, FREng (Department of Engineering)</li> <li>Rajinder Bhuhi (Career Development Service)</li> <li>Professor Hilary Burgess (School of Education)</li> <li>Professor Mary Dixon-Woods (Department of Health Sciences)</li> <li>Professor Lin Foxhall (School of Archaeology and Ancient History)</li> <li>Dr Turi King (Department of Genetics)</li> <li>Philippa Lambden (Stanhope House Day Nursery)</li> <li>Dr Emma Parker (School of English)</li> <li>Professor Catrin Pritchard (Department of Cancer Studies)</li> <li>Frances Stone (Residential and Commercial Services)</li> <li>Bridget Towle (Chair of Council)</li> </ul> <p>You can access their biographies here: <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/cr9ro3dhu15cs4s/Inspirational%20Women%20Gallery%20biographies.docx?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/cr9ro3dhu15cs4s/Inspirational%20Women%20Gallery%20biographies.docx?dl=0</a></p> <p>The gallery will also be displayed in the windows of the University Bookshop and on television display screens across campus from 11 March. Each gallery entry will include a photograph and brief profile of the award recipient.</p> <p>The campaign has been spearheaded with the image of Professor Olive Banks (1923-2006) who was the first woman to be awarded a Chair at the University in 1972. She was the trailblazer for women at the University of Leicester and led the way for future generations of women at the University. Like Olive, all of these women have broken through in their chosen fields and have also supported others to make progress.</p> <p>Professor Henrietta O\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdConnor, co-Chair of the Equality and Diversity Committee and organiser of the event, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThese women are all role models in their particular fields and the final twelve includes women from a range of backgrounds and career stages.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAll of these women have worked hard to help others achieve in their careers which is why many of them were nominated. Some have also juggled complex domestic responsibilities with their own career and managed to maintain a work-life balance.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe hope that people will join us in celebrating the achievements of all women at the University of Leicester and that others, both men and women, staff and students, will find the event and the gallery inspirational.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMany universities have begun to celebrate the achievements of women because often, for historical reasons, it is men who tend to have a higher profile within universities.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAt senior levels, universities remain male-dominated institutions. Fewer than 20% of Vice-Chancellors are women and nationally only around 20% of professors are women. For this reason it is important to mark International Women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Day by recognising the achievements of the talented women who work at the University and to celebrate their success.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis gallery goes some way in beginning to balance the representation of university staff to be more inclusive of today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds workforce.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The online gallery will be accessible from 12.30pm on 11 March at: <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/womenatleicester/international-womens-day/gallery\">http://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/womenatleicester/international-womens-day/gallery</a></p> <p align=\"center\"><strong>Ends</strong>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p><b>Notes to editors:</b></p> <p>For more information please contact Professor Henrietta O\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdConnor on <a href=\"mailto:hso1@le.ac.uk\">hso1@le.ac.uk</a></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-11T12:40:14Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/2018beyond-reasonable-doubt2019-the-official-behind-the-scenes-story-of-one-of-the-most-important-archaeological-discoveries-in-recent-history\">     <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdBeyond reasonable doubt\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: The official behind-the-scenes story of one of the most important archaeological discoveries in recent history</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/2018beyond-reasonable-doubt2019-the-official-behind-the-scenes-story-of-one-of-the-most-important-archaeological-discoveries-in-recent-history</link>     <description>The Grey Friars research team with Professor Lin Foxhall and Maev Kennedy to publish book exploring for the first time the complete story behind the identification of Richard III </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><b>Issued by Wiley Blackwell in March 2015</b></p> <p>THE BONES OF A KING: RICHARD III REDISCOVERED</p> <p>By the Grey Friars Research Team with Maev Kennedy and Lin Foxhall</p> <p>Publishing: 20th March 2015</p> <p>WITH MORE THAN 40 ILLUSTRATIONS, MAPS &amp; PHOTOGRAPHS INCLUDING COVERAGE OF THE DIG, THE KING\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdS REMAINS &amp; RECONSTRUCTION</p> <p>The dramatic story of Richard III, England\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds last medieval king, captured the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds attention when an archaeological team, led by the University of Leicester, identified his remains in February 2013.

a powerful woman ruling over houses at Grimsthorpe and Tattershall in Lincolnshire and a friend of Catherine Parr, Henry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds sixth wife - wielded subtle influence through her proximity to the king and became the focus of his affections.</p> <p>Before her romance with Henry, Katherine was married to his close friend Charles Brandon. The pair tied the knot in 1533, when Katherine was 14 and Charles almost 50. But in 1534 she and Henry began to exchange New Year gifts, and four years later, after the death of the king\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds third wife Jane Seymour, it was reported that they were enjoying one another\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds company.</p> <p>Katherine was appointed a lady-in-waiting to Henry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds last three queens, and in February 1546, six months after Charles Brandon\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds death, it was rumoured that Henry intended to wed her himself if he could end his present marriage to Catherine Parr. But the king passed away in January 1547 and the proposal was never made.</p> <p>David said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere can be little doubt that King Henry VIII remained prepared to change his wife, perhaps in the hope of begetting a second son, well into old age.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>David based much of his research on more than 40 letters Katherine sent to William Cecil, Lord Burghley, who she relied on for advice.

This is the first time such a behind-the-scenes insight has been revealed into the archaeological process.</p> <p>Mathew Morris, the Grey Friars Site Director from the University of Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Archaeological Services (ULAS) narrates the video to describe the archaeological process of excavating the car park.</p> <p>He said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis is a bit of the excavation that you don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt often get a chance to see. The video shows all aspects of the dig. This was a much bigger excavation than our first on this site when we discovered Richard III, and was our last chance to document the archaeology before the Visitor Centre was built on top of the car park.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis second dig was key to providing us with more information about the relationship of Richard III\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds grave to the rest of the church. We were able to excavate the additional graves we had identified during the first dig and also found evidence of a new friary building. This film footage is a great way to capture all of the aspects of the dig.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The footage was taken from a camera positioned looking down onto the dig from the old school building which is now the Richard III Visitor Centre. At the time the building had no electrical power so the camera was run from a car battery which was changed every four days. Over the 28 day period, the camera took more than 50,000 individual still images which were then rendered into the final clip, a process that took over 40 hours.</p> <p>Carl Vivian, Video Producer explained: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe University of Leicester has always been keen to record and make all aspects of the Richard III project freely available, and when the second dig was announced, it was suggested immediately that a time-lapse recording should be made to allow for the whole process to be viewed. This is another fascinating insight into the hard work that has underpinned the search and discovery of the remains of Richard III.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The University is releasing 26 video sequences to illustrate the key events in the discovery, science and reburial of the last Plantagenet King. These sequences are accessible to the media by contacting Carl Vivian (details below).</p> <p>Carl added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe search and discovery of Richard III has been an extraordinary adventure and part of why it has been so unique is the fact that the archaeologists and scientists have allowed every step of the journey to be recorded, so everyone can see and share the moments of each discovery being made.

The Leicester team found genetic links via a chain of male ancestors to both Genghis Khan and Giocangga, in addition to nine other dynastic leaders who originated from throughout Asia and date back to between 2100 BC and 700 AD.</p> <p>The project\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds leader, Professor Mark Jobling from the University of Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Department of Genetics, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe youngest lineages, originating in the last 1700 years, are found in pastoral nomadic populations, who were highly mobile horse-riders and could spread their Y chromosomes far and wide. For these lineages to become so common, their powerful founders needed to have many sons by many women, and to pass their status - as well as their Y chromosomes - on to them. The sons, in turn, could then have many sons, too. It\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds a kind of trans-generation amplification effect.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>First author of the study, Patricia Balaresque (now at Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd Paul Sabatier in Toulouse), added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIdentifying the ancestors responsible for these lineages will be difficult or impossible, as it would rely on finding their remains and extracting and analysing ancient DNA.

They were developed as part of a four-year collaboration between the Natural Environment Research Council\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (NERC) Co-ordinated Airborne Studies in the Tropics (CAST) project and NASA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment (ATTREX).</p> <p>The uninhabited aircraft, based at NASA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Armstrong Flight Research Centre, California, can fly at twice the height of Mt. Everest and double the altitude of a commercial jet for more than a day at a time, travelling the equivalent of half of Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds circumference in a single flight in an atmosphere where the air pressure is less than a tenth of that at sea level.</p> <p>The aircraft is flying above the equatorial regions of the Pacific Ocean at an altitude of 20km, where the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, meets the stratosphere above.\\ufffd\\ufffdScientists believe this area, known as the tropopause, plays a critical role in Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds climate.</p> <p>The first of the instruments, GHOST (Greenhouse Observations of the Stratosphere and Troposphere), was developed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds UK Astronomy Technology Centre in Edinburgh, in a joint effort with the Universities of Edinburgh and Leicester.</p> <p>Dr Hartmut Boesch, the science lead at the University of Leicester, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Global Hawk is an ideal vehicle for our GHOST instrument and thanks to its long duration, we can obtain an unique dataset of atmospheric greenhouse gases that will help us to better understand the drivers for the variability of these key gases. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Sitting in the belly of the Global Hawk, GHOST behaves like a sub-orbital satellite instrument, measuring greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane across large regions but in fine detail. This will allow scientists to produce precise maps of where greenhouse gases are being released and taken up at the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds surface \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd vital information for international climate negotiations.</p> <p>The second instrument, AIITS (the Aerosol Ice Interface Transition Spectrometer), measures particles like dust, water droplets, and ice crystals. The transport of particles and pollutants between the troposphere and stratosphere plays a crucial role in the climate system and the health of the ozone layer. AIITS was\\ufffd\\ufffdjointly developed by the universities of Hertfordshire and Manchester.</p> <p>The two UK pieces of kit are joined onboard by instruments from the ATTREX project. These focus on the transport of water vapour and other trace gases into the stratosphere. Studies show that even slight changes in the amount of water vapour in the stratosphere can warm temperatures by absorbing heat rising from the surface. \\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Dr Neil Harris at the University of Cambridge, science lead for the NERC CAST project, said:</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThese are important issues for climate science. The chance to fly two new UK instruments on the Global Hawk is very exciting. We are flying at temperatures below -80C in the equatorial East Pacific to investigate how thin cirrus clouds form. We then track back below the new NASA OCO-2 satellite to provide more detailed measurements where the satellite measures.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Andy Vick, Innovations Manager at STFC\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds UKATC facility and the lead investigator for the GHOST project celebrated the successful first flight of GHOST and said:</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThese incredibly sensitive instruments, that were originally developed to meet major astronomical challenges by dealing with very low levels of light, are now being used to instead accurately measure the incredibly tiny fluctuations in the levels of greenhouse gases. This new information will allow us to better understand these changes and the data collected will be used to evaluate and improve global models used to predict future climate change.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p style=\"text-align: center; \"><strong>ENDS</strong></p> <p><b>Further information:</b></p> <p><b>NERC media office</b></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:pressoffice@nerc.ac.uk\">pressoffice@nerc.ac.uk</a></p> <p><b>STFC media office</b></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Jake.gilmore@stfc.ac.uk\">Jake.gilmore@stfc.ac.uk</a></p> <p><b>UKATC:</b></p> <p>Dr A J Vick</p> <p><b>An image of the Global Hawk with instruments on board (CREDIT: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdJames Ross / NASA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) is available at:\\ufffd\\ufffd</b><b><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/rc61b9whf7sz01y/NASA%20Global%20Hawk%20%28Photo%20-%20James%20Ross%20%20NASA%29.jpg?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/rc61b9whf7sz01y/NASA%20Global%20Hawk%20%28Photo%20-%20James%20Ross%20%20NASA%29.jpg?dl=0</a></b></p> <p><b>Further images are available from the NERC and STFC media offices</b></p> <p><b>NERC</b>\\ufffd\\ufffdis the UK's main agency for funding and managing research, training and knowledge exchange in the environmental sciences.

The findings, which appear in an upcoming issue of the <i>Journal of the American Society of Nephrology</i> (JASN), provide new insights into how phosphate in the diet can impact heart health.</p> <p>Inorganic phosphate is a nutrient in nearly all diets. Because patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) lose the ability to excrete excess phosphate in their urine, the nutrient accumulates in their blood and cells. Such \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhyperphosphatemia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is thought to be an important contributor to CKD patients\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd increased risk of cardiovascular disease.</p> <p>To investigate this link, a team led by Alan Bevington, BA, DPhil and PhD student Nima Abbasian, BSc, MSc\\ufffd\\ufffd (University of Leicester, UK) examined the effects of hyperphosphatemia on the cells that form the lining of blood vessels. The researchers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experiments revealed a mechanism by which an excess of inorganic phosphate\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsimilar to levels found in the blood of CKD patients\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcauses a stress signal inside these cells. In cells that are stressed in this way, fragments known as microparticles break off from the cells and can promote the formation of blood clots. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis is important because blocking of blood vessels by blood clots\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda process known as thrombosis\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdis a common cause of injury and death, occurring in a wide range of human illnesses including CKD,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd said Dr Bevington.</p> <p>While the effects described in this study are especially relevant to patients with kidney dysfunction who lose the ability to excrete excess phosphate in their urine, nearly all modern Western diets are rich in phosphate, so even healthy individuals with normally functioning kidneys may experience some elevation of\\ufffd\\ufffd blood phosphate levels. In addition, there are a number of metabolic disturbances that can raise phosphate levels inside cells. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIt\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds possible therefore that the results of this study will also be relevant in other situations in addition to CKD,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd said Abbasian.</p> <p>Study co-authors include James Burton, BA, MBChB, MRCP, DM, Karl Herbert, BSc, PhD, Barbara-Emily Tregunna, BSc, MSc, Jeremy Brown, BSc, MSc, Maryam Ghaderi-Najafabadi, BSc, MSc, Nigel Brunskill, MBChB, ECFMG, PhD, FRCP, and Alison Goodall, BSc, PhD.</p> <p>Disclosures: The authors reported no financial disclosures.</p> <p>The article, entitled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHyperphosphatemia, Phosphoprotein Phosphatases, and Microparticle Release in Vascular Endothelial Cells,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd will appear online at <a href=\"http://jasn.asnjournals.org/\">http://jasn.asnjournals.org/</a> on 5 March, 2015.</p> <p><i>The content of this article does not reflect the views or opinions of The American Society of Nephrology (ASN).

Some parts of the Congo, Nigeria and Madagascar appear to receive much less rainfall now compared to 10 years ago. This is an issue even in the wet tropics of the Congo, where low rainfall means restrictions to ship movements on the rivers there, which are the main transport routes in the dense jungle.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLarge parts of the Sahel zone, which suffered from intense famine in the past, has greened up over the past decade, probably because of wetter weather. We know that rainfall in this region depends highly on the African monsoon. The weather systems can change a lot on the time-scales of tens of years. This means that our maps cannot be regarded as maps of long-term climate change impacts. They merely reflect climatic impacts over the past ten years. We know that this period is too short to relate it to the global warming debate.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFuture satellite observations will allow us to extend the time-series and observe large-scale changes in Africa.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Regions where more rainfall led to greener plants were mapped in West Africa, Central African Republic, West Cameroon and north-eastern part of South Africa. Areas of climatic vegetation degradation were located in Southern Madagascar, Nigeria, Kenya and the Garden Route region of South Africa.</p> <p>Meteorological stations in Africa are far and between. Satellites can fill in the gaps in weather observations. The researchers used a rain dataset that is produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (NOAA) Climate Prediction Centre and combined the best qualities of local rain gauge stations with the satellite data. The system is used by the US for a famine early warning system.</p> <p>The findings highlight areas where climatic changes are the likely cause of greener or browner vegetation. More rain can lead to a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgreening up\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of large regions, as was the case in the West African Sahel zone. If rains become scarcer, in dry areas the plants cannot \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgreen up\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd as much. This effect is large enough to be observed from satellite.</p> <p>The new concept developed by the research team interprets satellite observations of rainfall and vegetation greenness at the same time. If the plants lost some of their greenness over time, then the researchers checked for climatic changes, meaning reduced rainfall. If reduced rains coincide with browner plants, the chances are that the climatic change causes the changes in the plants.</p> <p>If there was more rain and the plants greened up over the ten years of data, the researchers think that there was a positive impact of climatic change on the plants. However, in areas where the weather got wetter but plants were browning, non-climatic factors are likely behind the change. Such factors can be human land use change, agricultural expansion, overgrazing or ecological disturbances.</p> <p>With over 30 million km<sup>2</sup> in size, Africa is a vast continent with over 200 times the area of England. Many countries are plagued by armed conflicts, water scarcity, diseases such as Ebola and HIV, slow economic development and high dependence on natural resources. Africa\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds vegetation plays a vital role in securing livelihoods and providing a basis of living for local communities.</p> <p>Dr Agata Hoscilo, the postdoctoral researcher responsible for producing the satellite maps, added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe results have shown that spatial patterns of different change processes can be detected in specific regions of Africa, which are generally consistent with independently reported literature on longer-term trends, El Ni\\ufffd\\ufffdo effects and decadal-scale climate oscillations.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis study confirms that most of the vegetation in sub-Saharan Africa depends on rainfall variability, particularly in the semi-arid and arid environments; however, there are areas where degradation of vegetation condition is driven by other anthropogenic or natural factors. The concept proved to be less reliable in the wet tropics. Use of coarse resolution satellite data can be a valuable source of information leading to better understanding of the drivers of change.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The study \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdA conceptual model for assessing rainfall and vegetation trends in sub-Saharan Africa from satellite data\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is published in the top-rated <i>International Journal of Climatology</i>, and is already available online.

The \\ufffd\\ufffd42 million Centre, which represents the largest investment in applied research and medical teaching by any UK university in the last decade, will have a significant impact on the training of future doctors, the fight against chronic disease, and revolutionising patient care in Leicester and beyond.</p> <p>The sculpture, by artist Diane Maclean, was commissioned by the University as the symbol of the Appeal. Utilising Diane\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds existing sculpture \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOvum\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, which was previously displayed at the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds 2013 Sculpture in the Garden exhibition at the Botanic Garden, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRenewal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd has a snake as its central element, symbolising healing and medicine. The periodic renewal of a snake\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds skin has long associated snakes with healing, making the sculpture a fitting symbol for the \\ufffd\\ufffd10 million public fundraising appeal.</p> <p>Professor Nick London, Head of the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Department of Medical and Social Care Education explained: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe new Centre for Medicine will have a tremendous impact on patients and students alike, the educational environment is critical to how well we educate our doctors and in turn care for patients and their families \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd transforming patient care locally, nationally and around the world. By 2018 the doubling time for medical knowledge will be 80 days, we will certainly need therefore to regularly renew our curriculum \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd just like the snake\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds skin.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRenewal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd will be unveiled by Professor London to an audience of supporters, academics, patients, students as well as some Leicester Tigers rugby players in support of the Appeal. The sculpture will remain at the upper mall of Highcross by John Lewis until moving to its permanent home at the Centre for Medicine, which is set to open on Lancaster Road in the autumn.</p> <p>Mark Colton, Deputy General Manager at Highcross said:\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre thrilled to be able to host the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRenewal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd sculpture at Highcross in support of the Centre for Medicine Public Appeal and help raise awareness of the work that it will do when the Centre is complete. It\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds a real honour to be a part of such a worthwhile appeal, to work with the University of Leicester and help them achieve their fundraising goal of \\ufffd\\ufffd10 million.\"</p> <p>Diane previously created \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStranded Heart\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd for the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Cardiovascular Research Centre Appeal, which now sits above the entrance of the \\ufffd\\ufffd12.6 million research centre at Glenfield Hospital.</p> <p>Diane said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI was delighted and challenged when asked to design a sculpture for fundraising for the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds new Centre for Medicine. I feel a special pleasure in being able to contribute in my own way to this wonderful project. The challenge was in finding a symbol for the very wide range of medical skills the new Centre will embody. 'Renewal' is a rethinking in a contemporary sculpture of the renowned symbol for medicine and healthcare, familiar throughout the world. Here it is enclosed within an egg, a symbol itself of new life.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI am privileged to have been connected to the University of Leicester over many years through exhibiting my sculpture in the University's Botanic Garden and having previously contributed to the appeal for the Cardiovascular Research Centre with \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStranded Heart\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. My best wishes go to the fundraising enterprise.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Steve O\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdConnor, Director of Development at the University of Leicester added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe are delighted with the support we have already received for the Centre for Medicine from individuals, trusts, community groups and organisations, all of which will help us to complete and equip this wonderful facility.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Centre for Medicine is giving the University the opportunity to train future generations of doctors to improve patient care and fight chronic disease. It is great that Diane has been able to capture with her symbolic sculpture the essence of the project which will save many lives in Leicester and beyond.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>To make a \\ufffd\\ufffd5 donation to the Centre for Medicine Appeal, text TMRW15 \\ufffd\\ufffd5 to 70070, to watch the Appeal fundraising video, visit <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS1UkZNNEwI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS1UkZNNEwI</a> or for more information about the Appeal, visit <a href=\"http://www.le.ac.uk/savinglives\">www.le.ac.uk/savinglives</a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center; \"><b>\\ufffd\\ufffd</b><b>ENDS</b></p> <p><b>NOTES TO NEWSDESKS<br /></b><br />For more information about the Centre for Medicine Appeal and the sculpture unveiling, please contact Laura Woodhouse, Development Executive via 0116 252 5132 or <a href=\"mailto:lw234@le.ac.uk\">lw234@le.ac.uk</a></p> <ul> <li>Please note Diane will be available for interview after the unveiling event</li> </ul> <p><b>About Highcross Leicester</b></p> <p>Highcross Leicester opened on September 4 2008 with a dazzling display of light, music and entertainment, which attracted over two thirds of Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds population, 125,000 people</p> <ul> <li>As Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds biggest ever redevelopment project, the \\ufffd\\ufffd350 million Highcross development is now one of the most exciting retail dining and entertainment destinations in the East Midlands, boasting: </li> <li>An unrivalled retail mix \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd led by a four-storey John Lewis department store</li> <li>Numerous exciting cafes and restaurants, including the world renowned Carluccio\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds, Yo!
