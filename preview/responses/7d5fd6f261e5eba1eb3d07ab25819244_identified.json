In January 1983 operations of the Landsat system were transferred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA).  In October 1985 the Landsat system was commercialized.  After that date, all Landsat commercial rights became the property of Space Imaging, with exclusive sales rights to all U.S. thematic mapper (TM) data.  Throughout these changes, the USGS retained primary responsibility as the Government's long-term archive of Landsat data.  As of July 1, 2001, Space Imaging relinquished their commercial right to Landsat  data.  The Land Remote Sensing Policy Act of 1992  (Public Law 102-555) officially authorized the government and assigned responsibility to the Department of Interior delegated down to the USGS.</othercit>                 <onlink>https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/GLS </onlink>             </citeinfo>         </citation>         <descript>             <abstract>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) collaborated on the creation of eight global land survery (GLS) data collections: GLS1975, GLS1990, GLS2000, GLS2005, GLS2005-Islands (EO-1), GLS2010, GLS2010 Islands (EO-1) and GLSLIMA (Antarctica) . Each of these global data sets was created from the primary Landsat sensor in use at the time for those periods of time: the Multispectral Scanner in the 1970s, the Thematic Mapper (TM) in 1990's, and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with TM data in 2000, 2005, and 2010.  Direct downlink to a ground station was the only way to acquire Landsat 5 TM data, because unlike Landsat 7, the Landsat 5 satellite did not have an onboard solid-state recorder. To obtain Landsat 5 TM imagery for areas outside the United States, the USGS negotiated agreements with ground stations around the globe to downlink and send data to USGS. These agreements made thousands of additional Landsat 5 TM scenes available for GLS consideration.  The GLS datasets are scene-based.  Other decadal mosaics are available in the Landsat Legacy collections.</abstract>             <purpose>The USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center has managed the Landsat data archive since the launch of Landsat 1. This archive provides a rich collection of information about the Earth's land surface. Major characteristics and changes to the surface of the planet can be detected, measured, and analyzed using Landsat data.  The effects of desertification, deforestation, pollution, cataclysmic volcanic activity, and other natural and anthropogenic events can be examined using data acquired from the Landsat series of Earth-observing satellites. The information obtainable from the historical and current Landsat data play a key role in studying changes to the Earth's surface.  Landsat data have been used by government, commercial, industrial, civilian, and educational communities in the US and worldwide. They are being used to support a wide range of applications in such areas as global change research, agriculture, forestry, geology, resources management, geography, mapping, water quality, and oceanography.  The types of changes that can be identified include agricultural development, deforestation, natural disaster, urbanization, and the development and degradation of water resources.</purpose>             <supplinf>GLS 1975 Landsat data is available from the USGS.  In addition to its Landsat data management responsibility, the USGS investigates new methods of characterizing and studying changes on the land surface with Landsat data.</supplinf>         </descript>         <timeperd>             <timeinfo>                 <sngdate>                     <caldate>19751126</caldate>                 </sngdate>             </timeinfo>             <current>Ground condition</current>         </timeperd>         <status>             <progress>In work</progress>             <update>Continually</update>         </status>         <spdom>             <bounding>                 <westbc>-180</westbc>                 <eastbc>180</eastbc>                 <northbc>90</northbc>                 <southbc>90</southbc>             </bounding>         </spdom>         <keywords>             <theme>                 <themekt>None</themekt>                 <themekey>Global Land Survey</themekey>                 <themekey>Global  </themekey>                 <themekey>Landsat</themekey>                 <themekey>MSS</themekey>                 <themekey>TM</themekey>                 <themekey>ETM+</themekey>             </theme>         </keywords>         <accconst>None</accconst>         <useconst> There is no guarantee of warranty concerning the accuracy of these data.
