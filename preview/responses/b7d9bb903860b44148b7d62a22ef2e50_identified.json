of CSCST-UK&lt;br&gt;for many years. Recently, RSC has decided to dedicate two RSC Travel Grants&lt;br&gt;awards (up to \\ufffd\\ufffd800 each) to CSCST-UK members. The Grant is designed to&lt;br&gt;assist UK-based young researchers who seek or have collaboration with&lt;br&gt;universities or research organisations in China. The 2014 RSC-CSCSTUK&lt;br&gt;Travel Grants is now open for application to all CSCST-UK members. The&lt;br&gt;prospective candidates need fill in the application form (attached) and&lt;br&gt;send it along with his/her CV and a letter from the Chinese host&lt;br&gt;university/institute to cscstuk@gmail.com .
