Brown from Miami, took place in the Gulf of Mexico and then along the East US coast to Boston. The effort was in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP). The cruise was designed to obtain a snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm. This was the second occupation, with the first occurring in 2007, and complemented mooring time series and other regional OA activities. The cruise included a series of 8 transects approximately orthogonal to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts and a comprehensive set of underway measurements along the entire transect.</abstract>     <purpose>To measure key carbon, physical and biogeochemical parameters in coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and eastern coast of the US in relation to Ocean Acidification.</purpose>     <startdate>2012-07-21</startdate>    <enddate>2012-08-13</enddate>     <westbd>-90.809</westbd>    <eastbd>-68.515</eastbd>    <northbd>43.032</northbd>    <southbd>26.006</southbd>     <spatialReference></spatialReference>     <geographicName>U.S. East Coast</geographicName>    <geographicName>Gulf of Mexico</geographicName>      <fundingAgency>       <agency>NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program</agency>       <title>East coast observing support/prep for GOMECC cruise/ship of opportunity (SOOP) efforts</title>       <ID>OAPFY13.03.AOML.001</ID>    </fundingAgency>     <researchProject></researchProject>     <Platform>       <PlatformName>RV Ronald H.

CTD/rosette casts were performed with a package consisting of a 24-place, 10-liter rosette frame (AOML white frame), a 24-place water sampler/pylon (SBE32) and 24, 10-liter Bullister/Niskin-style bottles. This package was deployed on all stations/casts. Underwater electronic components consisted of a Sea-Bird Electronics (SBE) 9 plus CTD with dual pumps and the following sensors: dual temperature (SBE3), dual conductivity (SBE4), dual dissolved oxygen (SBE43), and a Simrad 807 altimeter. The CTDs supplied a standard Sea-Bird format data stream at a data rate of 24 frames/second. The SBE9plus CTD was connected to the SBE32 24-place pylon providing for single-conductor sea cable operation. Power to the SBE9plus CTD, SBE32 pylon, auxiliary sensors, and altimeter was provided through the sea cable from the SBE11plus deck unit in the computer lab.

The on deck pressure before and after the cast were stable at 1.67 +/- 0.081 db, and 1.68 +/- 0.087 db respectively. Near surface pressure values (which are taken as the near-surface pressure at the markscan and the last fired bottle pressure) showed relatively small variability (4.41+/- 0.40 db before and 4.54+/- 0.33 db after). </uncertainty>       <flag></flag>       <methodReference>http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/gcc/GOMECC2/Cruise_Report.pdf.</methodReference>       <biologicalSubject></biologicalSubject>       <speciesID></speciesID>       <researcherName>Molly Baringer</researcherName>       <researcherInstitution>Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</researcherInstitution>    </variable>     <variable>       <abbrev>te</abbrev>       <fullname>CTD temperature</fullname>       <controlledName></controlledName>       <observationType>profile</observationType>       <insitu>In-situ observation</insitu>       <unit>degree C</unit>       <measured>Measured</measured>       <samplingInstrument>CTD</samplingInstrument>       <analyzingInstrument>Sea-Bird SBE-911plus CTD system</analyzingInstrument>       <duration></duration>       <detailedInfo>A detailed and more complete description is available in the cruise report at: http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/gcc/GOMECC2/Cruise_Report.pdf.

Both sensors tracked each other very well, with no noted problems. The DO sensors were calibrated to dissolved O2 check samples by matching the up cast bottle trips to down cast CTD data along isopycnal surfaces, calculating CTD dissolved O2, and then minimizing the residuals using a non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. The fitting determined calibration coefficients for the sensor model conversion equation and proceeded in a series of steps. Each sensor was fit in a separate sequence. The first step was to determine the time constants for the exponential terms in the model. These time constants are sensor-specific but applicable to an entire cruise. Once the time constants had been determined, casts were fit individually to O2 check sample data. The resulting calibration coefficients were then smoothed and held constant during a refit to determine sensor slope and offset. Calibration accuracy was examined by comparing O1-O2 over a range of station numbers and pressures (bottle trip locations) for each cast. For the entire cruise, only one set of oxygen sensors were used, both tracked each other extremely nicely. The two sensors show a median difference of -2.96 micro-mol/kg and a pseudo standard deviation of 1.21 micro-mol/kg.</uncertainty>       <flag></flag>       <methodReference>http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/ocd/gcc/GOMECC2/Cruise_Report.pdf.</methodReference>       <biologicalSubject></biologicalSubject>       <speciesID></speciesID>       <researcherName>Molly Baringer</researcherName>       <researcherInstitution>Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</researcherInstitution>    </variable>     <submissionDate>28-Apr-2014</submissionDate>        <update>30-Oct-2014</update>  </metadata> ",
