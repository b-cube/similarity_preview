Six certified observers were placed on vessels from seven different ports located in Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas. There were a total of 17 trips ranging from 4 to 64 sea da onboard 11 different vessels with a total of 691 tows sampled in water depths ranging from nearshore to over 300 ft in fifteen different statistical zones. Data collected during this project was used to conduct a formal cohort analysis (VPA) and compute mortality estimates for all Foundation collected red snapper data (both past and present). Results were used to validate ELB landings estimates by region (statistical zone) and to assist fisheries managers in the assessment of the red snapper stock. The analysis suggests that natural mortality for age-0 red snapper may be higher than that previously considered in past stock assessments and therefore may have implications for future management. These results are currently under review in an article submitted to the North American Journal of Fisheries Management and are presently in press, but will appear in Volume No. 28.</abstract>          <relation-note>Report Produced From This Dataset</relation-note>       </item>    </related-items>    <fgdc-contacts>       <fgdc-contact role=\"Distributor\">          <contact-type>cntper</contact-type>          <contact-person-name>Brown-Eyo, Pamela </contact-person-name>          <contact-org-name>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</contact-org-name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>75 Virginia Beach Drive</street-address>          <city>Miami</city>          <state-prov>FL</state-prov>          <zip>33139</zip>          <email>pamela.brown-eyo@noaa.gov</email>          <voice>305-361-4565</voice>          <fax>305-361-4460</fax>          <org-business-hours>8:00 AM - 4:30 PM EST/EDT</org-business-hours>       </fgdc-contact>    </fgdc-contacts>    <fgdc-time-period>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>2005-04-01</begdate>                <begtime/>                <enddate>2008-12-31</enddate>                <endtime/>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current>Ground condition</current>       </timeperd>    </fgdc-time-period>    <publisher>       <person-contact-info>          <name>Brown-Eyo, Pamela </name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>75 Virginia Beach Drive</street-address>          <city>Miami</city>          <state-prov>FL</state-prov>          <zip>33139</zip>          <country/>          <email>pamela.brown-eyo@noaa.gov</email>          <phone>305-361-4565</phone>          <fax>305-361-4460</fax>       </person-contact-info>    </publisher> </catalog-item> ",
