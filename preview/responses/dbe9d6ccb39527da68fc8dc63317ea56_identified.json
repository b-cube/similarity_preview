Goliath grouper has been overfished to the extent that the IUCN (World Conservation Union) has classified it as \"critically endangered\". The species was protected in the southeastern U.S. in 1990 through action by Gulf of Mexico and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Councils and the National Marine Fisheries Service. Since that time there has been a steady recovery. The primary purpose of these goliath grouper studies was to provide an understanding of adult ecology and behavior so that the population could be managed sustainably. Investigations involved; 1) distribution throughout the southeastern U.S., 2) regional densities in Florida, 3) habitat characteristics, 4) movement patterns, 5) regional size distributions, 6) diet and trophic patterns, and 7) spawning biology. The autors found that the vast majority of the goliath grouper population of the southeastern U.S. is restricted to Florida waters, mostly south Florida. Population recovery began off southwest Florida in the area of abundant juvenile habitat, the Ten Thousand Islands, and expanded to the north and east to southeast Florida, especially off Palm Beach County where spawning aggregations now exist. Goliath grouper prefer high relief habitat with extensive holes and caves large enough to accommodate adults, except in coral reef habitat where population densities are relatively sparse. Except for spawning migrations they display strong site fidelity. Goliath grouper feed mostly on crabs (over 60% of the diet) and especially mud crabs and swimming crabs. Fishes dominating the diet are mostly sedentary species such as toadfish, boxfish, and burrfish. They are not apex predators, but instead feed at a relatively low trophic level, similar to that of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides). According to the bioenergetics model adult goliath grouper food consumption per day is very low, but additional data are needed to reduce uncertainty. Spawning occurs in aggregations during the late summer through early fall (August through October). Night-time sounds produced by goliath grouper during this period (and no other) appear directly related to spawning and may be useful in determining spawning areas, spawning season, and frequency. The researchers confirmed night-time spawning by collecting goliath grouper eggs (verified genetically) in the late evening and early morning downstream from spawning aggregations during the last quarter moon in the Atlantic and during the new moon in the Gulf. Quantitative reef survey data on the regional population densities of goliath grouper in Florida was concordant with semi-quantitative Reef Environmental Education Foundation (REEF) data; this result will reduce uncertainty about the use of REEF's population density data for future stock assessments.   </abstract>          <purpose>To estimate the regional population densities of goliath grouper managed by the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council and the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council in the southeastern United States, emphasizing those populations occurring on the West Florida Shelf and the Atlantic coast of Florida.  Five major questions we addressed were: (1) What is the current distribution of goliath grouper in the southeastern United States and the current regional population densities along Florida?s coasts?  (2) What are the regional demographic patterns of the recovering goliath grouper population?  (3) What habitat constitutes essential habitat for adult goliath grouper?  (4) What are the spawning characteristics of goliath grouper?  (5) What are the dominant prey species of goliath grouper and what is the direct impact of the recovering goliath grouper population on those species? </purpose>          <supplinf/>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>20061001</begdate>                <enddate>20080930</enddate>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current>                                     ground condition                                 </current>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>Complete</progress>          <update/>       </status>       <spdom>          <bounding>             <westbc/>             <eastbc/>             <northbc/>             <southbc/>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>None</themekt>             <themekey>Goliath Grouper</themekey>             <themekey>Jewfish</themekey>             <themekey>Abundance</themekey>             <themekey>population density</themekey>             <themekey>demographics</themekey>             <themekey>predation effects</themekey>             <themekey>christopher koenig</themekey>             <themekey>cooperative research</themekey>             <themekey>ecology</themekey>             <themekey>na05nmf4540045</themekey>             <themekey>felicia coleman</themekey>             <themekey>fsu</themekey>             <themekey>florida state university</themekey>          </theme>          <place>             <placekt>None</placekt>             <placekey>west florida shelf</placekey>             <placekey>atlantic ocean</placekey>             <placekey>florida</placekey>             <placekey>gulf of mexico</placekey>             <placekey>gom</placekey>          </place>          <temporal>             <tempkt>None</tempkt>             <tempkey>2006-2009</tempkey>          </temporal>       </keywords>       <accconst>A requester must submit a written request via email to the Regional CRP coordinator whom will review the request in consultation with the NMFS project partner for appropriate release of the data.
