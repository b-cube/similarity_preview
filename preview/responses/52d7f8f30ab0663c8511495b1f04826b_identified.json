The first is a legacy shapefile of subdivision boundaries which was created and edited separately from the subdivision lots and ownership parcel layers. Due to the independent creation and maintenance of these layers, it is common to see line data separation between subdivision boundaries, lots, and parcels where no legal separation exists. Editing of this dataset more or less ceased at the end of 2010.Beginning in January 2011, new subdivisions have been created and maintained using the ESRI Parcel Fabric data model. In addition, as conditions permit, older subdivisions are re-drawn to original plat and/or City-resurveyed dimensions, and added to the Parcel Fabric dataset. When these older subdivisions are added to the Parcel Fabric, the legacy shapefile representation of the subdivision boundary is deleted.For display on the City website and download from the Open Data Catalog, these two sources are combined into one subdivision layer. Subdivisions based on the Parcel Fabric data model will have a SYSTEM_START_DATE value of January 2011 or later, and will be consistent with underlying lot and parcel data.</abstract>       <purpose>This layer portrays boundaries of subdivided lands within the City and County of Denver.  Denver-owned lands in other counties are not included in this dataset.</purpose>       <supplinf>This dataset is considered to be complete. Errors and omissions should be brought to the attention of the contact person for the metadata. The dataset is updated when new subdivisions are recorded by the Clerk and Recorder, or when older subdivisions are re-digitized to plat or City-resurvey dimensions.</supplinf>     </descript>     <status>       <update>Daily</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-105.109967</westbc>         <eastbc>-104.734490</eastbc>         <northbc>39.827270</northbc>         <southbc>39.614309</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>None</themekt>         <themekey>survey</themekey>         <themekey>property</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt>         <themekey>boundaries</themekey>         <themekey>planningCadastre</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>None</placekt>         <placekey>Denver</placekey>         <placekey>Denver County</placekey>         <placekey>Colorado</placekey>         <placekey>USA</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>None</accconst>     <useconst>ACCESS CONSTRAINTS:   None.
