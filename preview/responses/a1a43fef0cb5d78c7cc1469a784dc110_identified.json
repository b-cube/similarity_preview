This is a speech that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> composed for delivery at a meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>. The subject of the speech is a treaty of peace between <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> and <name type=\"person\">Philip</name> of <placeName key=\"Macedon\">Macedon</placeName>, which was established in <date value=\"-346\">346 BCE</date> after <name type=\"person\">Philip</name> had captured <placeName key=\"Amphipolis\">Amphipolis</placeName>, a city allied to <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, and the Athenians were eager to prevent his taking more of their possessions (See <bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 2\" n=\"Aeschin. 2\">Aeschin. 2</bibl>;<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 19\" n=\"Dem. 19\"> Dem. 19</bibl>). In this speech <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> argues that &#8212; although he opposed this treaty earlier, and still thinks that it was a bad idea &#8212; <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> should accept it as an accomplished fact, do nothing to undermine it for the time being, and look for other ways to advance Athenian interests. There is a problem, though regarding this speech. The speech was written in <date value=\"-346\">346 BCE</date> (source for date: <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 5\" n=\"Dem. 5.14\">Dem. 5.14</bibl>; <bibl>Raphael Sealey, <title>Demosthenes and his Time: a study in Defeat</title> (Oxford, 1993) 157-158</bibl>), which makes it earlier than <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>&#8217; <title>On the Embassy</title> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 19\" n=\"Dem. 19\">Dem. 19</bibl>), which was delivered before a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> in <date value=\"-343\">343 BCE</date> (Source for date: <bibl>E. M. Harris, <title>Aeschines and Athenian Politics</title> [Oxford, 1995]</bibl>). In that later speech, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> claims that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>, alone, spoke in favor of allowing <name type=\"person\">Philip</name> to become a member of the Amphictyonic Council, the body that governed the shrines at <placeName key=\"Delphi\">Delphi</placeName> and that was composed of representatives of various states (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 19\" n=\"Dem. 19.113\">Dem. 19.113</bibl>). But here, in <title>On the Peace</title>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> says that to oppose <placeName key=\"Philip\">Philip</placeName> in this would be dangerous. Because of this, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Libanius</name>, a <dateRange from=\"300\" to=\"399\">4th century CE </dateRange>scholar who wrote extensively on <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, says: <cit><bibl author=\"Libanius\" n=\"Libanius, Hypothesis to the Speech 'On the Peace' 6\"></bibl><quote>It seems to me that this speech was composed, but never delivered</quote></cit> (<cit><bibl author=\"Libanius\" work=\"Lib. Hyp. 6\" n=\"Libanius, Hypothesis to the Speech 'On the Peace' 6\"></bibl><quote lang=\"grc\">ou(=tos de\\\\ o( lo/gos pareskeua/sqai me/n, ou) mh\\  ei)rh=sqai/ moi dokei=</quote></cit>) (<title><bibl author=\"Libanius\" work=\"Lib. Hyp. 6\" n=\"Libanius, Hypothesis to the Speech 'On the Peace' 6\">Hypothesis to the Speech &#8217;On the Peace&#8217;</bibl></title><bibl author=\"Libanius\" work=\"Lib. Hyp. 6\" n=\"Libanius, Hypothesis to the Speech 'On the Peace' 6\">, 6</bibl>). Would Demosthenes try to get away with such an obvious lie? Modern scholars do not agree on an answer to this question, although Sealey&#8217;s recent study assumes that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> did deliver the speech (<bibl>Raphael Sealey, <title>Demosthenes and his Time: a study in Defeat</title> (Oxford, 1993) 157-158</bibl>). </p> <byline>Christopher Blackwell</byline> </div0>    </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
