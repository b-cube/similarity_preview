It highlights USGS current conditions water data. For example, you can use it to monitor conditions at a favorite river or stream. Any USGS current conditions\\ufffd\\ufffdwater data is available.</p> <p>There is nothing to install. Simply use any browser to go to <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://m.waterdata.usgs.gov\">m.waterdata.usgs.gov</a>. While the site was designed for smartphones, it may work fine on tablet computers, most other mobile devices and desktop computers. The site may not work on older devices or older browsers.</p> <p>The site is not designed for cell phones with tiny screens, that are text-oriented or that are not \"smart\". In general, you must be able to install an app on your mobile device to use the site acceptably. You may notice quirks and issues with older mobile devices or the latest mobile devices.</p> <p>Since the content on the site is for current conditions only, you may want to access the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/\">full USGS Water Data for the Nation</a>. An easy link is provided to take you to the full site.</p> <p>This site is new so the USGS expect some issues to be noticed. Hence, this is a beta release. See <a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Problems\">reporting problems</a> if you want to report recurring issues.</p> <h2><a name=\"Initial\"></a>Initial access</h2> <p>When you first connect to the site, you will be required to acknowledge that the data are provisional before proceeding.\\ufffd\\ufffd<span>After pressing OK, you are asked if you are willing to share your current location. This is useful to show USGS current conditions sites near you. Sharing your location is not required.</span></p> <p>Typically you will share your location. The screen should be zoomed in to a comfortable magnification level at or near the location of your device and look similar to this:</p> <p><img src=\"http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/mobile/images/mmap.PNG/@@images/eeb15a00-62cb-407e-8f0d-6bbd8c5dae4c.png\" title=\"\" class=\"image-inline\" alt=\"\" /></p> <h2><a name=\"Symbology\"></a>Symbology</h2> <p>Upside down raindrops point to the location of USGS current condition sites. If you shared your location then you will see a glowing brown dot that indicates the position of your device.</p> <p>The color of the raindrops indicate the kind of site. Most are gray raindrops and indicate surface water sites such as rivers, streams and lakes.\\ufffd\\ufffdFull explanations of all the symbols used can be accessed through the <a class=\"anchor-link\" href=\"#Special\">menu button</a> in the top left corner of this screen.</p> <h2><a name=\"Using\"></a>Using the mapper</h2> <p>Use the + button to zoom in and the - button to zoom out. If you zoom out too far, sites will disappear from the map or no new sites may appear. You will also see a warning message. For performance reasons, if the scale is too large\\ufffd\\ufffdit is impractical to show all possible sites on the device. Zoom in to an appropriate zoom level and sites will reappear.</p> <p>You can navigate east, west, north or south using your device. With most mobile devices this is done by dragging your finger across the map in the direction you want the map to move.</p> <p>There is also a search bar. Type \"Albany\" in the search box and execute the query and you are likely to see Albany, New York. If you are in Georgia, you may see Albany, Georgia, as it is closer to you. A sophisticated map search engine is integrated into the product. While sophisticated, you cannot use it to search by USGS site number of site name. If you type a geographical name there is a good chance you will see USGS sites near it.</p> <h2><a name=\"Special\"></a>Special access buttons</h2> <p>There are two useful buttons:</p> <ul> <li>The <strong>compass button </strong>allows you to quickly return to the location of your device <img src=\"http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/mobile/images/mlocation.PNG\" title=\"\" class=\"image-inline\" alt=\"\" /></li> <li>The <strong>menu button</strong> in the top left corner takes you to a menu with additional options\\ufffd\\ufffd<img src=\"http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/mobile/images/mmenu.PNG\" title=\"\" class=\"image-inline\" alt=\"\" /></li> </ul> <h2><a name=\"Getting\"></a>Getting site details</h2> <p>To see details on a site, simply select the upside down raindrop, usually by pressing on it.

Where water  completely fills an aquifer that is overlain by a confining bed, the aquifer is  referred to as a confined (or artesian) aquifer. When a confined aquifer is  penetrated by a well, the water level in the well will rise above the top of the  aquifer (but not necessarily above land surface).

This article describes the nomenclature used in establishing site numbers.</p> <h3>Surface water sites</h3> <p>Stations are assigned numbers according to a downstream order system.\\ufffd\\ufffd In assigning station numbers in downstream order, no distinction is made between partial-record stations and other stations; therefore, the station number for a partial-record station indicates downstream-order position in a list made up of both types of stations. Gaps are left in the series of numbers to allow for new stations that may be established; hence, the numbers are not consecutive. An eight-digit number for a station, such as 03171000 includes the two-digit part number \"03\" plus the six-digit downstream-order number \"171000.\" The part number is derived from Water Supply Paper (WSP) publication volumes or \"Parts\" and designates the major river basin; for example, part \"03\" is the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee River Basins.\\ufffd\\ufffd In areas of high station density, more than eight digits may be used for a station number.</p> <p>The following is a summary table of the Part numbers and the associated areas:<br />01\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd North Atlantic slope basins <br />02\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd South Atlantic slope basins <br />03\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee River basins <br />04\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd St. Lawrence River basin <br />05\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Hudson Bay and Upper Mississippi River basin <br />06\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Missouri River basin <br />07\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Lower Mississippi River basin <br />08\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Western Gulf of Mexico basins <br />09\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Colorado River basin <br />10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The Great Basin <br />11\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Pacific slope basins in California <br />12\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Pacific slope basins in Washington and upper Columbia River basin <br />13\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Snake River basin <br />14\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Pacific slope basins in Oregon and lower Columbia River basin <br />15\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Alaska <br />16\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Hawaii <br /><br />Further detail regarding downstream order number can be found in multiple USGS documents, the most comprehensive\\ufffd\\ufffd being in WSPs 1721 through 1740.\\ufffd\\ufffd For example, page one of WSP 1722 the Description of Data section contains a verbose description.\\ufffd\\ufffd A PDF version of that document can be found <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://pubs.usgs.gov/wsp/1722/report.pdf\">here</a>.</p> <h3>Wells and miscellaneous sites</h3> <p><br /> The USGS well system is based on the grid system of latitude and longitude. The system provides the geographic location of the well and a unique number for each site. The number consists of 15 digits. The first 6 digits denote the degrees, minutes, and seconds of latitude, and the next 7 digits denote degrees, minutes, and seconds of longitude; the last 2 digits are a sequential number for wells within a 1-second grid. In the event that the latitude-longitude coordinates for a well are the same, a sequential number such as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd01,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd02,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and so forth, would be assigned as one would for wells (see fig. 4). This system may also be used for random water-quality miscellaneous sites. (A local well-numbering system is also used. It is a 2-part identifier, consisting of the abbreviation of county name and the serial number within the county.)</p> <p><b>It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the site ID, once assigned, is used as a pure number and has no locational significance beyond representing the best location available at the time the site ID was assigned.</b> The latitude and longitude fields for the site should be used for the site's location.</p> <p><img src=\"http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/faq/sites/images/sites1.PNG\" title=\"\" class=\"image-inline\" alt=\"\" /></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mark Hamill</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Sites</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stations</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-02-23T18:05:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/site-information/what-is-my-watershed-address-and-how-will-it-help-me-find-usgs-data\">     <title>What is my watershed address and how will it help me find USGS data?

This system provides what is essentially a watershed address, and in many cases provides a convenient way to locate USGS water data for your area of interest. In addition to a number, a formal name is also assigned to each HUC, but it is important to be aware that formal names can sometimes differ from a name used locally. For example, Hydrologic Unit number 02080206 is named the Lower James, for the downstream part of the James River watershed in Virginia. The first 2-digits of the code indicate that the Hydrologic Unit is part of the Mid Atlantic Region, as shown on the map below.</p> <p>USGS Water Data for the Nation can be searched using either the 2-digit HUC or the 8-digit HUC for regional and local perspectives.</p> <p><img src=\"http://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/tutorials/site-information/images/HUCregions.gif\" title=\"\" class=\"image-inline\" alt=\"\" /></p> <p><b>To find a HUC for your area of interest, follow these steps:</b></p> <hr /> <h2><b>Step 1</b></h2> <p>Go to the Watersheds web page at <a href=\"http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/\" target=\"_blank\">http://water.epa.gov/type/watersheds/</a>.
