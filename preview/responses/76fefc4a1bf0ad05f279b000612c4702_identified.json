The   purpose of the study was to examine price trends of a major food   commodity within an important agricultural market in Western Europe   and, in particular, to measure the correlation between wheat price   fluctuations and demographic fluctuations in France. Prices and   quantities of wheat were recorded, either fortnightly or monthly, by   local officials in the major wheat-growing areas and subsequently   relayed to higher levels of the French government. These tables of   information were finally copied and maintained by the Ministry of   Interior and the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture and ultimately  deposited in the French National Archives.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1486-01\" cycle=\"P1\">1486-01</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1913-12\" cycle=\"P1\">1913-12</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1986-09\" cycle=\"P1\">1986-09</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1987-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1987-06</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>France</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>All wheat markets in France for which prices and quantities   sold were recorded by the French administration in the nineteenth  century.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data, and event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A representative sample of wheat markets covering every   part of France, with the exception of Alsace-Lorraine, were chosen.   After eliminating those with imprecise or incomplete information, 53   markets comprised the final list. The northern half of France is more   heavily represented since wheat production is more extensive there than   in the south. Usually one market per \"departement\" (administrative   area), either that of the largest city or of the center with the   largest quantity of sales, was chosen for inclusion in the collection.   In addition, several large ports, such as Cherbourg and Dieppe, and  other cities, such as Chateaudun and Albi, were also included.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          Archives Nationales (Paris): F*11 1779-2678, F*11  2887-2984             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 These data are stored in a machine-readable tabular   format with blanks used to separate elements within the tables.
