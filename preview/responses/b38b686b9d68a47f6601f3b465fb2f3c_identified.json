While acknowledging the historical, industrial and aesthetic features that have contributed to their success, my argument is that the continuing fascination of these films is in large part attributable to the manner in which they engage the spectator and evoke unconscious concerns about family cohesion, interpersonal conflicts and the death of parents.&#xD; &#xD; My investigation begins with an analysis of the films\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd prefilmic provenance and narrative characteristics, placing an emphasis on the role of their narrative and extra-narrative components as embodying social, pedagogical and psychological meanings. In order to explore how the films engage with the spectator\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds unconscious mind, I employ a number of Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalytic concepts. The post-Freudian models include that of Jacques Lacan and those based on object-relations theory, particularly as developed by Melanie Klein and Donald Winnicott. These conceptual models are used to explore the content of the films, while that of Winnicott is also used to explore the visual fascination of the form Disney gave them.&#xD; &#xD; Although these films were designed for family viewing, and many of the more distressing aspects of their original stories were toned down in Disney\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds adaptations, the films portray a remarkably dystopic version of family life, of childhood and of growing up. Moreover, psychoanalytic investigation suggests that concealed within the films\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd attractive animation, music and humour, there lie recurrent ruminations on anxieties about death caused by germs (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs) and old age (Pinocchio) and about culpability for injury (Dumbo) and death of mothers (Bambi). I conclude that the films reward the spectator by offering her/him the opportunity to engage with, fantasise about and work through the problems encountered by the films\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd protagonists.

Tetrahydrocurcumin (THU), a major metabolite of curcumin, has been demonstrated to be an antioxidant, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory agent. In this study, we investigated the protective effect of THU against Cd-induced hypertension, raised arterial stiffness and vascular remodeling in mice. Description: Copyright: 2014 Sangartit et al.

Authors: Hermann, PC; Trabulo, SM; Sainz, B; Balic, A; Garcia, E; Hahn, SA; Vandana, M; Sahoo, SK; Tunici, P; Bakker, A; Hidalgo, M; Heeschen, C Abstract: In spite of intense research efforts, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains one of the most deadly malignancies in the world. We and others have previously identified a subpopulation of pancreatic cancer stem cells within the tumor as a critical therapeutic target and additionally shown that the tumor stroma represents not only a restrictive barrier for successful drug delivery, but also serves as a paracrine niche for cancer stem cells. Therefore, we embarked on a large-scale investigation on the effects of combining chemotherapy, hedgehog pathway inhibition, and mTOR inhibition in a preclinical mouse model of pancreatic cancer.

The sphere has two surface zones: a soft surface of zero acoustic impedance and a hard surface of infinite acoustic impedance. The zones are arranged such that axisymmetry of the sound field is preserved. The equivalent source method is used to compute the sound field. It is shown that, by varying the sizes of the soft and hard zones on the sphere, a significant reduction can be achieved in the scattered acoustic power and upstream directivity when the sphere is near a free surface and its soft zone faces the incoming wave and vice versa for a hard ground. In both cases the size of the sphere\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds hard zone is much larger than that of its soft zone. The boundary location between the two zones coincides with the location of a zero pressure line of the incoming standing sound wave, thus masking the sphere within the sound field reflected by the free surface or the hard ground. The reduction in the scattered acoustic power diminishes when the sphere is placed in free space. Variations of the scattered acoustic power and directivity with the sound frequency are also given and discussed Description: Copyright \\ufffd\\ufffd 2014 Delyia Kim et al.
