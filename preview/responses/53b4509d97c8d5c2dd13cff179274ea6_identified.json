The entire central part of the country is occupied by  one of the largest sand  deserts in the world, the Garagum. About  four-fifths of the country is <i>steppe</i> (semiarid grassy plain) that is part of the southern portion of the vast Turan  lowland.</p> <div align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"turk2.jpg  turk2.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"turk2.jpg\" />Most of Turkmenistan  lies at an elevation of  500 m (1,640 ft) or less. The Akdzhakaya Depression,  located in the  north central part of the country, is the lowest point in the  republic  at 110 m (360 ft) below sea level. The Kopetdag mountains, which are   prone to violent earthquakes, fringe the Garagum desert along the  <img alt=\"turk3.jpg  turk3.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"turk3.jpg\" />country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  southern border with Iran.  Along the <img alt=\"turk4.jpg  turk4.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"98\" src=\"turk4.jpg\" width=\"147\" />mountain foothills is a  belt of oases, which are fed by mountain  streams.</div> <p align=\"justify\">Water  Resources</p> <p>Rivers</p> <p align=\"justify\">The Amu Darya, which originates in the  mountainous Pamirs region of Tajikistan east of <img alt=\"turk5.jpg  turk5.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"99\" src=\"turk5.jpg\" style=\"float: left; \" width=\"149\" />Turkmenistan  and forms  part of the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds border with Uzbekistan,  and the Murgap, which  originates in Afghanistan, are the two largest  permanent rivers. Water  from the Amu Darya and the Murgap is diverted into the GaragumCanal   (built during the Soviet period) to supply water to the arid <img alt=\"turk6.jpg  turk6.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"turk6.jpg\" />southern  portions  of Turkmenistan.  Other canals divert water from the Amu Darya   in the northern part of the country.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Groundwater  resources</p> <p align=\"justify\">The  renewable groundwater resources are  estimated at 3.36 km3/year, of  which about 3 <img alt=\"turk8.jpg  turk8.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"turk8.jpg\" />km3/year are estimated to  be infiltration from rivers,  including surface water resources  generated in upstream countries. In 1994, the  existing equipment  enabled a groundwater abstraction of 1.22 km3/year.</p> <p>Lakes and Dams</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"turk7.jpg  turk7.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"turk7.jpg\" />There are 18 artificial reservoirs with a  total  capacity of about 2.89 km3: 8 on the Murghab River; 3 on the  Tedzhen  River; 3 on the Atrek River; and 4 on the Kara Kum Canal. The largest   reservoir is the Hauz-Khan Reservoir on the Kara Kum Canal with a total  capacity of 0.875 km3.  All the reservoirs were been designed and  constructed mainly for irrigation  purposes, and are affected by heavy  siltation. <br /> The gross hydropower potential of the  country is estimated at 5.8  gigawatt hours (GWh), while the total installed  capacity was about 0.7  GWh in 1993. The construction of the Puli Hatum  reservoir on the  Tedzhen River on the border between Iran and Turkmenistan has been  planned but  is awaiting agreement between the two countries. Its total  capacity would be  1.3 km3, and it has been designed for flood control,  hydropower  generation, and flow regulation purposes.</p> <div align=\"justify\">The outflow of  drainage water has led to the  creation of artificial lakes in natural  depressions. The largest one is  Lake   Sarakamysh with a storage  capacity of about 8 km3. A major  environmental issue in Turkmenistan is  the permanent accumulation of  pollutant salt in these lakes, as this leads to  the degradation of  their flora and fauna.</div> <p align=\"justify\">Plants  and Animals</p> <p align=\"justify\">Plant life is sparse in the vast, arid desert,  where only  drought-resistant grasses and desert scrub grow. The  mountain valleys in the  south support wild grapevines, fig plants, and  ancient forests of wild walnut  trees. The mountain slopes are covered  with forests of juniper and pistachio  trees. Dense thickets called <i>tugai</i> grow along riverbanks. The wildlife  in the mountains of Turkmenistan   includes the caracal (or Persian lynx), goats, cheetahs, and snow  leopards. In  the desert, gazelles, foxes, and wildcats thrive. In the  tugai live jackals,  wild boar, and the rare pink deer. Reptiles are  abundant and include the  Central Asian cobra, the desert monitor (a  large lizard), several species of  gecko (a small lizard), and the  tortoise. Migratory birds, such as ducks,  geese, and swans, inhabit the  Caspian shore during winter.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Natural  Resources</p> <p>Turkmenistan has substantial reserves of oil and natural gas in  the Caspian Sea area and in the Garagum desert. Other natural  resources  include deposits of coal, sulfur, magnesium, and salt. Only 5 percent   of the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds total land area is cultivated, nearly all of which  (23,000 sq  km; 8,880 sq mi) is irrigated.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Vassiliy Sokolov</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-10-21T08:40:26Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://caspian.iwlearn.org/caspian-1/countries-1/pix/russia\">     <title>Russia</title>     <link>http://caspian.iwlearn.org/caspian-1/countries-1/pix/russia</link>     <description>Info about Russia</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Land</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"rus1.jpg  rus1.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"rus1.jpg\" />In both total area and geographic extent Russia  is the  largest country in the world. With an area of 17,075,400 sq km  (6,592,800 sq  mi), Russia  constitutes more than one-ninth of the  world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds land area. From north to south Russia extends more than 4,000 km  (2,400 mi)  from Arctic islands in the Barents Sea to the southern  border along the <img alt=\"rus2.jpg  rus2.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"203\" src=\"rus2.jpg\" width=\"137\" />Caucasus Mountains. From the coast of the Baltic Sea to   Big Diomede Island (Ratmanov Island) in the Bering Strait, Russia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds   maximum east-west extent is almost 10,000 km (6,200 mi), a distance   encompassing 11 time zones and spanning nearly half the circumference of  the  Earth. Russia stretches  across parts of two continents, Europe  and Asia, with the Ural Mountains and Ural River marking the boundary  between them.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Water  Resources</p> <p>Rivers</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"rus3.jpg  rus3.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"rus3.jpg\" />Russia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  longest rivers are all located in  Siberia. The  Ob\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and Irtysh rivers form Russia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  largest river system.  The Amur and its headwaters, the Onon and the Shilka,  form Russia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds   second longest system, with a total length of 4,416 km (2,744 mi). <br /> Among  individual rivers, the Lena River is longest; <img alt=\"rus4.jpg  rus4.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"102\" src=\"rus4.jpg\" width=\"137\" />it flows  through Siberia to the  Arctic Ocean from its <img alt=\"rus5.jpg  rus5.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"179\" src=\"rus5.jpg\" width=\"134\" />source near Lake Baikal.  The next longest individual  rivers are the Irtysh and the Ob\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The  Volga River,  located in European Russia, is the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds fourth  longest river and the longest  river in Europe. The fifth longest river,  the  Yenisey, flows north from Mongolia  through central Siberia to the  Arctic Ocean.  The Yenisey River carries more water than any other   stream system in the country.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Groundwater  resources</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"rus6.jpg  rus6.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"103\" src=\"rus6.jpg\" width=\"137\" />The renewable groundwater resources are   estimated at 788 km3/year. This figure, however, does not include   resources in the form of inland ice, glaciers, and pergelisol  (permafrost). For  the regions of western and eastern Siberia  alone,  the quantity of ice of the Arctic islands is estimated at 5,000 km3  and  that of the mountain glaciers at 170 <img alt=\"rus7.jpg  rus7.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"rus7.jpg\" />km3. The resources in the  form of  pergelisol are even larger. The overlap between surface water and   groundwater resources has been estimated at 512 km3/year.</p> <p>Lakes and Dams</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"rus8.jpg  rus8.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"103\" src=\"rus8.jpg\" width=\"134\" />There are about two million fresh- and   saltwater lakes in the Russian    Federation. The largest saltwater lake  is  the Caspian Sea. The largest freshwater lake  is Lake Baikal,   located entirely within the Russian Federation  in the southeast of  eastern Siberia.        Dams have been constructed on most large rivers  in the Russian  Federation,  mainly <img alt=\"rus9.jpg  rus9.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"rus9.jpg\" />for electrical energy production, but also for  irrigation. There are 330  large reservoirs in use at present and about  3,000 medium-sized reservoirs.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Plants  and Animals</p> <p align=\"justify\">Russia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds forests, located mostly in  Siberia,  cover more than two-fifths of the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds total territory,  and account for  nearly one-fourth of the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds total forested area.  The forest zone has two  distinct areas: a large, mainly coniferous  forest, or taiga, lies in the north,  and a much smaller area of mixed  forest lies in the south.      The  taiga occupies two-fifths of  European Russia and extends across the Urals to  cover much of Siberia. A  mixed forest, containing both coniferous and broad-leaved  deciduous  trees, occupies the central portion of the Great European Plain  between  Saint Petersburg  and the Ukrainian border. <br /> Animals are abundant and varied throughout Russia. The tundra  is home  to polar bears, seals, walruses, arctic foxes, lemmings, reindeer, and   arctic hares. Birdlife includes white partridges, snowy owls, gulls, and  loons.  Geese, swans, and ducks migrate into the region during summer, a  time when huge  swarms of mosquitoes, gnats, and other insects emerge.  \\ufffd\\ufffdSouth of the tundra, the  taiga is a habitat for moose, brown bears,  lynx, sables, and a variety of  forest birds, including owls and  nightingales. The broad-leaved forests of the  Great European and West  Siberian plains contain boars, deer, wolves, foxes, and  minks. There  are also a variety of birds, snakes, lizards, and tortoises.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Natural  Resources</p> <p align=\"justify\">Russia contains the greatest  reserves of  mineral resources of any country in the world. Russia is  especially  rich in mineral fuels. The country may hold as much as one-half of  the  world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds potential coal reserves and may hold larger reserves of  petroleum  than any other nation. Russia is also well endowed with  most  of the nonferrous metals: aluminum, copper, lead, zinc. The aluminum  ores Russia does have are found primarily in the  Urals, northwestern  European Russia, and south central Siberia.  Raw materials for the  manufacture of chemicals are also abundant. These include  potassium and  magnesium salt deposits in the Kama River  district of the western  Urals. Some of the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds largest deposits of apatite  (a mineral from  which phosphate is derived) are in the central Kola Peninsula; other  types of phosphate ores are found  in other parts of the country. Common  rock salt is found in the southwestern  Urals and southwest of Lake    Baikal. Surface deposits  of salt are derived from salt lakes along the  lower Volga Valley.  Sulfur is found in the Urals and the middle Volga  Valley.  High-grade limestone, used for the production of cement, is  found in many parts  of the country, but particularly near Belgorod   near the border with Ukraine,  and in the Zhiguli Hills area of the  middle Volga Valley.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Vassiliy Sokolov</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-10-21T06:16:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://caspian.iwlearn.org/caspian-1/countries-1/countries\">     <title>Countries</title>     <link>http://caspian.iwlearn.org/caspian-1/countries-1/countries</link>     <description>Short description of the littoral countries.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><img alt=\"az.gif  az.gif \" class=\"image-inline\" src=\"../environmental-issues/documents/az.gif\" style=\"float: left; \" /></p> <p><b><span class=\"internal-link\">Azerbaijan Republic:</span><span class=\"internal-link\"></span><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"pix/azerbaijan\"> <span class=\"style9\">(more info)</span></a> </b></p> <p><b>Location:</b> Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan is bordering with Russia, Turkey, Iran, Armenia and Georgia<br /> <b>Area:</b> <i>total:</i> 86,600 sq km<br /> <b>Caspian coastline:</b> aprox. 800 km<br /> <b>Climate:</b> dry, semiarid steppe<br /> <b>Population:</b> 8,238,672  (July 2009 est.)<br /> <b>Languages:</b> Azerbaijani  90.3%, Lezgi 2.2%, Russian 1.8%, Armenian 1.5%, other 3.3%, unspecified 1%  (1999 census)<br /> <b>Capital:</b> Baku<br /> <b>GDP:</b> purchasing power parity - $73.65  billion (2008 est.)<br /> <b>GDP - per capita:</b> purchasing power parity - $9,000  (2008 est.)<br /> <b>Inflation rate (consumer prices):</b> 21.6%  (2008 est.)<br /> <b>Labor force:</b> 5.782  million (2008 est.)<br /> <b>Unemployment rate: </b>0.8%  official rate (2008 est.) <br /> <b>Exports:</b> $38.28  billion f.o.b.

It was the second largest republic of the former Soviet Union,  after Russia. Although  high mountain ranges fringe <img alt=\"kaz2.jpg  kaz2.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"kaz2.jpg\" />the republic\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds eastern and  southeastern borders,  the terrain of Kazakhstan consists mostly of  deserts, steppes (vast, semiarid  grassy plains), and hilly upland  areas. Deserts and semideserts (such as stone,  salt, and sand  wastelands) cover more than two-thirds of Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  surface area.  <img alt=\"kaz3.jpg  kaz3.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"135\" src=\"kaz3.jpg\" width=\"152\" />The most expansive deserts in the republic are the sandy, barren   Qyzylqum, which also occupies part of Uzbekistan, and the clay-crusted   Betpak-Dala; both are located in the southern portion of the republic.</p> <div align=\"justify\">Kazakhstan contains  extreme variations in  elevation. The Tian Shan mountains contain the <img alt=\"kaz4.jpg  kaz4.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"kaz4.jpg\" />country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  highest point,  Hantengri (6,398 m/20,991 ft), which lies in the extreme  southeast  where the borders of Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, and China  meet. The Altay  Mountains along the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  eastern border also contain high peaks.  Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  lowest elevation is found in the extreme southwest, just  east of the Caspian Sea, where the <img alt=\"kaz5.jpg  kaz5.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" height=\"93\" src=\"kaz5.jpg\" width=\"157\" />Karagiye Depression lies 132 m  (433  ft) below sea level. The area north of the Caspian, in northwestern  Kazakhstan, is occupied by the Caspian  Depression, which also extends  into Russia.</div> <p align=\"justify\">Water  Resources</p> <p>Rivers</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"kaz6.jpg  kaz6.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"kaz6.jpg\" />Kazakhstan  contains an extensive network of  rivers. Many of Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  rivers drain within the republic, although  the Ishim, Irtysh, and Tobol rivers  flow north into Russia and   eventually drain into the Arctic Ocean. Due to  dry weather conditions,  the riverbeds of most of the republic\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds small and  <img alt=\"kaz7.jpg  kaz7.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"kaz7.jpg\" />medium-sized rivers  remain dry for much of the year.          One  of Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds largest  rivers, the Syr Darya, enters  Kazakhstan  in the south and follows a northwesterly course toward the  northern portion of  the Aral Sea, a saltwater lake that straddles  Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  border with Uzbekistan.</p> <p><img alt=\"kaz8.jpg  kaz8.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"kaz8.jpg\" />The Ural River, which  flows south from Russia,  enters  northwestern Kazakhstan  and drains into the Caspian Sea, a saltwater   lake that is the largest inland body of water in the world.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Lakes and Dams</p> <p align=\"justify\"><img alt=\"kaz9.jpg  kaz9.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"kaz9.jpg\" />There  are more than 17,000 natural lakes in  Kazakhstan, with a total area of about  45,000 km2 and a total volume of  water estimated at about 190 km3.  Salinity varies from 0.12  grams/liter in east Kazakhstan to 2.7 grams/liter in  the central part  of the country. More than 4,000 lakes are inventoried as  saline. The  largest lakes are: Lake Balkhash, with an area of 18,000 km2  and a  volume of 112 km3; Lake  Zaisan, with an area of about 5,500 km2;  and  Lake Tengiz, with an area of 1,590 km2.  Irrigation development in the  last 20 years in the basin of the Ili River,  which flows into Lake  Balkhash, has led to ecological  problems in the region, notably the  drying up of small lakes. For the whole  country, it is estimated that  about 8,000 small lakes have dried up in the  recent past due to  overexploitation of water resources.</p> <p align=\"justify\">Plants  and Animals</p> <p align=\"justify\">Forested  areas amount to only 1 percent of  Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds territory, as the steppes and  deserts are virtually  treeless. Drought-resistant plants such as wormwood,  tamarisk (salt  cedar), and feather grass are native to the steppes, although  grain  crops have largely supplanted native vegetation in the northern steppes.   Scrub plants are common in the Qyzylqum desert. Thickets of elm,  poplar, reeds,  and shrubs grow along the banks of rivers and lakes.  Coniferous trees, such as  spruce, larch, cedar, and juniper, grow in  thick forests on the mountain slopes  in the extreme east and southeast.</p> <div align=\"justify\">Animal life in  Kazakhstan varies by region.  The republic is home to the extremely rare saiga  antelope, which is  protected by government decree. The saiga inhabits the  steppes, as do  roe deer, wolves, foxes, and badgers. Various animals thrive in  the  deserts, including gazelles; rodents, such as gophers, sand rats, and  jerboas;  and reptiles, such as lizards and snakes. Wild boars, jackals,  and deer are  found near the rivers and lakes. The mountains are home  to ibex (wild goats),  lynx (wildcats), wolves, wild boars, and brown  bears. The endangered snow  leopard, which has long been illegally  hunted for its fur, also lives in the  mountains, preying on ibex.  Kazakhstan\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  many different species of birds include ring-necked  pheasants, partridges,  black grouse, bustards, hawks, and falcons, all  of which are native to the  steppes. Eagles and lammergeyers (a type of  vulture) nest mostly in the  mountainous regions.</div> <p align=\"justify\">\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p align=\"justify\">Natural  Resources</p> <p align=\"justify\">Only 8 percent of Kazakhstan is cultivated, and  the northern steppes are  the most intensely farmed area. Kazakhstan   contains vast mineral resources, with significant deposits of coal, iron  ore,  manganese, bauxite, chromium, tungsten, uranium, and other  minerals. Kazakhstan also has large reserves of petroleum  and natural  gas in the western Caspian Sea  area.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Vassiliy Sokolov</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-10-19T10:27:22Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://caspian.iwlearn.org/caspian-1/countries-1/pix/iran\">     <title>Iran</title>     <link>http://caspian.iwlearn.org/caspian-1/countries-1/pix/iran</link>     <description>Short description of Iran</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Land</p> <p><img alt=\"iran1.jpg  iran1.jpg \" class=\"image-left\" src=\"iran1.jpg\" />Iran  is the second largest country in the  Middle East, after Saudi Arabia.

Iran also has one of the world's largest  reserves of copper;  deposits are located throughout the country, but the major  lode lies in  the central region between the cities of Yazd  and Kerman.  This region  also serves as a center for the mining of bauxite, coal, iron ore,   lead, and zinc. Additional coal mines operate throughout the Elburz  Mountains;  iron ore mines also exist near Zanjan in the northwest, near  Mashhad in the  northeast, and on Hormuz Island in the Strait of  Hormuz.  Iran  also has valuable deposits of chromite, gold, manganese,  silver, tin, and  tungsten, as well as various gemstones, such as amber,  agate, lapis lazuli, and  turquoise. <br /> Although  about one-third of Iran\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  total land area is  cultivable, only 9.8 percent is under cultivation. An  additional 6  percent of the total land is used for pasture.

Iran also has one of the world's largest  reserves of copper;  deposits are located throughout the country, but the major  lode lies in  the central region between the cities of Yazd  and Kerman.  This region  also serves as a center for the mining of bauxite, coal, iron ore,   lead, and zinc. Additional coal mines operate throughout the Elburz  Mountains;  iron ore mines also exist near Zanjan in the northwest, near  Mashhad in the  northeast, and on Hormuz Island in the Strait of  Hormuz.  Iran  also has valuable deposits of chromite, gold, manganese,  silver, tin, and  tungsten, as well as various gemstones, such as amber,  agate, lapis lazuli, and  turquoise. <br /> Although  about one-third of Iran\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds  total land area is  cultivable, only 9.8 percent is under cultivation. An  additional 6  percent of the total land is used for pasture.

Although plastic materials are light and could easily be  formed into various shapes and sizes, their disposal is rather  difficult and unlike regular household garbage, it will take a  long  time to disintegrate.  Burning is an alternative method of plastic-waste  disposal, but this would release considerable amounts of hazardous  substances into the environment like carbon monoxide, which prevents  oxygen to reach our heart and brain. Some plastics even have materials  which could harm people with asthma and bronchitis. The urban wastes in  Turkmenbashi City are either land filled, dumped or burned. Currently,  plastic wastes are burned along with other domestic wastes. The  predominant winds worsen the situation by bringing the hazardous fumes  and plumes toward the city and the sea shores. As a result, the  population of Turkmenbashi City and the coastal environment suffer the  most. So, one of the best alternatives is the recycling of used  plastics.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <table align=\"left\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"image/MSGPV-TK01-05-2.jpg\" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\">A project was developed to  protect the people\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds health and the environment by reducing hazardous  toxic substances resulting from plastic incineration.

To achieve this  goal, it is necessary to sort the garbage, and in particular, take  plastic waste materials out of garbage and process them into plastic  goods for every day uses like clothing hangers. The decision to make  plastic hangers for clothes was made after conducting a marketing  research in Turkmenistan; especially in the city of Turkmenbashi . As a  result of this project, at least 100 tons of plastic waste products will  be collected and utilized annually. This will be carried out by  gathering plastic wastes with the assistance of the municipality. Then  the sorting, processing and manufacturing of plastic products will be  conducted.

As the population living in the Volga-Caspian basin was traditionally engaged in fishing and fish processing,  decline in fish stocks leads to overexploitation of existing fish stocks, halting or even closing of fish  processing plants. This leads to the loss of jobs, social tension and unsustainable development of territories.  In particular in the Tumak village there are no lands for agricultural production. Due to the lack of proper  conditions for agriculture, the population is occupied by poaching in the Volga River delta and the Northern  Caspian Sea. The above mentioned problems have resulted in decrease of employment from 1200 to 200 people.  Similar situation is observed throughout the Astrakhan oblast.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <table align=\"left\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"image/MSGPV-RU02-05-2.jpg\" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\">This project facilitates the establishment of a fish-farm for intensive  growing of marketable fish species in closed pools and ponds through the usage of existing idle waste water  treatment plant in the Tumak village.

When a flood occurs, the loose soil and rocks of the banks slip into the water stream and subsequently,  the trees with weakened roots and foundations fall into the river as well. During the spring season, the flooding is a  prevalent phenomenon and the fallen debris and broken trunks of the trees clog the river flow and intensify the impact  of flooding on adjacent lands. The fallen wreckage gradually sinks to the bottom of the river and produces hydrogen  sulphide, which greatly worsens the hydrological regime of the river. The other adverse effect of the sunken trees is  their blockage of river routes used by important fish species like sturgeon to reach their spawning areas at river  upstreams.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <table align=\"left\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"image/MSGPV-KZ-01-05-2.jpg\" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\">The Ural River Bottom-cleaning project intends to collect the snags and logs,  and other undesirable objects out of the river-bed within the territories of West-Kazakhstan oblast.

Apart from this, the genetic quality and diversity of  these species have also suffered. During the catch season, the sturgeon hatcheries are faced with the problem of  obtaining suitable male breeders. On the other hand, there are times when the male breeders are sufficient, but  the number of female breeders is insufficient and thus, the harvested sperms from these breeders are not used  properly.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <table align=\"left\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"image/MSGPV-IR12-05-2.jpg\" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\">This project aims to collect the excess sperm from sturgeon hatcheries,  preserve them for long periods of time and make them available to sturgeon hatcheries when required.

This approach has not only failed to protect  the crops in the past 60 years, but also has led to many negative impacts, such as pest breakouts and threats to  the human health and environment. The more pesticides used, the more farmlands had to be sprayed.  In some provinces,  where the intensity of agriculture is quite high, there is a very dangerous concentration of pesticides. About 60  percent of the total pesticides sprayed in Iran, are used only in the 3 Iranian Caspian coastal provinces. About 26,000  tons of different pesticides are distributed between the farmers each year. Also, substantial amounts of pesticides are  imported illegally, some of which are included in the list of banned chemicals. A similar spraying intensity occurs for  certain fruits and vegetables, in particular in summer crops and greenhouses, where the number of applications is as  high as 6-12 times a season. Since 1994, the Government of Iran has started a number of programs to reduce the use of  pesticides. But many of them are not sustained, mainly due to the fact that they did not fully incorporate bottom-up  participatory approaches and the relevant stakeholders failed to set in place an appropriate model for sustainable  plant management at the farm level.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <table align=\"left\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"image/MSGPV-IR10-05-2.jpg\" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\">The objective of this project is to introduce the Farmers Field School (FFS)  approach to the rice paddy fields in Iranian Caspian Provinces.

However, these practices negatively impact biological diversity and resources  of the region. Given the perspectives of population growth, increase of the energy costs for gas and electricity  and inflation, this impact will increase in the future. However the intensification of these negative impacts will  lead to desertification and reduction in fishing resources at the local level. As a good indicator, illegal poaching  by the local population constitutes annually over 1000 kg of fish and 1500 heads of waterfowls.

The groundwater is scarce and the average annual precipitation  is about 150 mm. So, the region always feels a deficit of potable and irrigation water.  Goyudjik settlement is  located in this region.  Near the settlement, there is a manganese mine.  There are wells near this mine, where  water is extracted. There is no drinking water in the area around the settlement.  The inhabitants of the settlement  consume potable water delivered by trucks.  One truck of water with a volume 5 cubic meters costs 250 000 manats,  which is very expensive for ordinary families.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <table align=\"left\"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align=\"absmiddle\" src=\"image/MSGP-TK02-04-2.jpg\" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\">The objective of this project is to provide potable water either from the  mining area or from the sea in order to combat the shortage of drinking water in the region. Originally, it was  planned to extract potable and irrigated water from a well at the manganese mining area. However, the water  analysis showed that the mining water had too much impurity; so the attention was turned to the distillation of  sea water. The project aims to obtain potable and irrigation water for the inhabitants of a settlement and to  supply drinking-water to 500 families by collecting and cleaning the brackish water and then desalinating the  water with the use of the electrical dialysis unit. Thus, the necessary equipment like water tank, tubes, pumps  and the distilling plant was purchased. Then the equipment was transported and installed at the project site.  The sea water and the distilled water samples are being analyzed regularly and the distilled water samples have  passed the stated standards for irrigation and drinking water. Currently, the project is at its final stages to  operate at full capacity and deliver the much needed potable water to the settlement. It is hoped that with the  successful implementation of this project, the other settlements in the area could use the same procedure for  obtaining drinking water.</p> <p align=\"center\" class=\"TextContent\"> </p> <p align=\"justify\" class=\"TextContent\"><b>Project Budget:</b> 58,475 USD  <b>Total Grant:</b> 28,995 USD</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nuttapong</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-10-03T09:51:33Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
