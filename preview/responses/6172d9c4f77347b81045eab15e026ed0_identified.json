Data was collected from 1993-1995 primarily on BLM lands to compare past thinnings (10-25 years old) to immediately adjacent unthinned stands and nearby old-growth where available.  Data is focused on overstory trees, saplings, seedlings, shrubs and herbaceous plant cover in the various stand types.</abstract> <purpose>The BLM was interested in whether thinning was an effective tool in creating old-growth-type stand conditions - which stand characteristics, how fast, and which qualities in the thinnings appear to be most effective.  This retrospective analysis would help guide new experimental thinnings being planned.</purpose> <supplinf>Science Information System Project #: 703</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>199306</begdate> <enddate>199509</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <descgeog>Western Oregon, Columbia River to the Medford area in both the Coast Range and Cascades.</descgeog> <bounding> <westbc>-124</westbc> <eastbc>-122</eastbc> <northbc>46</northbc> <southbc>42</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>none</themekt> <themekey>thinning</themekey> <themekey>old-growth</themekey> <themekey>stand structure</themekey> <themekey>density management</themekey> <themekey>regeneration</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>none</placekt> <placekey>Western Oregon</placekey> <placekey>BLM - Coos Bay District</placekey> <placekey>BLM - Medford District</placekey> <placekey>BLM - Eugene District</placekey> <placekey>BLM - Salem District</placekey> <placekey>BLM - Roseburg District</placekey> <placekey>Coast Range</placekey> <placekey>Cascade Range</placekey> </place> </keywords> <taxonomy> <keywtax> <taxonkt>none</taxonkt> <taxonkey>Douglas-fir</taxonkey> <taxonkey>western hemlock</taxonkey> </keywtax> <taxonsys> <classsys> <classcit> <citeinfo> <origin>C.

They were able to check measurements of their work since many technicians returned for a second year.  Data was collected on electronic data recorders (CMT MC-III) that only accepted certain data in certain fields, and allowed them to avoid data entry mistakes back at the office.  Data were also validated using internal consistency checks (e.g. Comparing total heights with height to live crown).  Along with this, impossible data were changed to missing values.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>Refer to Attribute and Accuracy section</logic> <complete>Refer to Methodology</complete> <lineage> <method> <methtype>Field</methtype> <methdesc> Field data collection:  We inventoried stands from mid-June to September in 1993-5 (10 to 25 years following thinning), sufficient time after thinning for changes in the overstory and understory to develop.  Pairs and triads were inventoried within days of one another to minimize the likelihood of observing differences due to time of year.  A stand entry location, direction and distance was pre-assigned on each stand map considering boundaries only (points were located 75 meters from any stand edge), ensuring an unbiased sample of a homogenous, interior area.  Six to twelve (typically ten) points followed a systematic grid on 50-75 meter intervals depending on total stand size.  We recorded data directly into electronic spreadsheets. Trees were sampled using a modified ORGANON sampling template of variable- and fixed-radius plots (Hester et al. 1989).  Live dominant and codominant overstory trees &gt; 20.3 cm (8 inches) were sampled with variable-radius points; we recorded species, DBH, height, height to live crown, crown radius, and any damage for each tree.  We tallied number of dead overstory trees and snags (larger, well-decayed legacies of the previous stand) which fell within the point.  Five-year radial growth and incremental growth since the year of thinning was determined for three trees per point via increment coring from a range of tree sizes.  Total tree age was assessed only for a subset of dominant trees sufficient to assign a site index value (King 19xx).  We recorded the same tree information for living intermediate and suppressed trees (2.54 to 20.3 cm DBH) sampled on five 4.75m-radius (15.56 ft) circular plots, one at the point center and four 15 m distant in each cardinal direction.  Radial growth rates were assessed on a subset of these smaller trees using a crosscut of their stems.  Tree seedlings and saplings (&lt;2.54cm DBH but &gt; 15cm in height) were sampled on five 2.37m-radius (7.78 ft) subplots at the same locations.  We recorded seedling species, height, and age (but only for a subsample of those species which required destructive age determination). Understory non-tree vegetation data were recorded on each 2.37m-radius  subplot, segregated into three layers: (tall shrubs) - typically greater than 1.5 meters,  (small shrubs) - typically 50 to 150 cm in height; and (herbs) - up to 50 cm (after MacLean &amp; Wein, 1977).  Herb sampling protocols and data analyses are presented in Bailey et al (1996).  Although shrubs by definition have woody, above-ground stems, we included sword fern (Polystichum munitum) and bracken fern (Pteridum aquifolium) in the small shrub layer given its apparent functional influence.  We recorded the number, species, height and average crown radius of individual stems of all tall shrubs (e.g., vine maple, Acer circinatum).  Percent cover of small shrubs Oregon grape (Berberis nervosa), salal (Gaultheria shalon), sword fern, bracken fern and all other observed species were recorded by visual estimate in 10% classes on these same subplots.  Actual height of the small shrub layer was recorded. Small shrub cover could total one hundred percent, but typically included some empty space or bare ground. Diameter and decay class for all downed woody debris &gt; 2.5 cm were recorded along a 15m (50 ft) transect at each point and summed to calculate a stand average volume (Hazard and Pickford 1979).  Leaf Area Index (LAI) for the overstory canopy (above the tall shrubs), tall shrubs, and small shrub layers was measured at each point with a LICOR 2000 canopy area meter (LICOR Inc, Lincoln NE).   We also recorded slope, aspect, and the presence of major topographic or management features (e.g., roads) for interpretation. </methdesc> </method> <procstep> <procdesc>Original data - no processing</procdesc> <procdate>Unknown</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> <cloud>0</cloud> </dataqual> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>shrubcov.wq1, herbcov.wq1</enttypl> <enttypd>Quattro Pro spreadsheets containing herb and shrub cover data</enttypd> <enttypds>Borland/Corel</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>&lt;SPECIES COVER&gt;</attrlabl> <attrdef>Cover of individual &lt;species&gt; coded according to Plants Database</attrdef> <attrdefs>data developer</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <rdom> <rdommin>0</rdommin> <rdommax>100</rdommax> <attrunit>percent</attrunit> </rdom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>HERB</attrlabl> <attrdef>Total herb cover</attrdef> <attrdefs>data developer</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <rdom> <rdommin>0</rdommin> <rdommax>100</rdommax> <attrunit>percent</attrunit> </rdom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>MOSS</attrlabl> <attrdef>Total moss cover</attrdef> <attrdefs>data developer</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <rdom> <rdommin>0</rdommin> <rdommax>100</rdommax> <attrunit>percent</attrunit> </rdom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>PLOTS</attrlabl> <attrdef>Point/Plot number</attrdef> <attrdefs>Data developer</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>List of plot numbers</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>SHRUB</attrlabl> <attrdef>Total shrub cover</attrdef> <attrdefs>data developer</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <rdom> <rdommin>0</rdommin> <rdommax>100</rdommax> <attrunit>percent</attrunit> </rdom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>SITE</attrlabl> <attrdef>Study Site</attrdef> <attrdefs>data developer</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>List of study site identification values</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> </detailed> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>USGS Forest &amp; Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center (FRESC)</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing and Physical Address</addrtype> <address> 777 NW 9th St. Ste. 400 </address> <city>Corvallis</city> <state>Oregon</state> <postal>97330</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(541) 750-1030</cntvoice> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc>s:\\\\projects\\\\metadata\\\\project_files\\ appeiner\\\\bailey thinning study\\\\herb and shrub data</resdesc> <distliab>Although these data have been processed  successfully on a computer system at the U.S.  Geological Survey, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the accuracy or utility of the data on any other system or for general or scientific purposes, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty.
