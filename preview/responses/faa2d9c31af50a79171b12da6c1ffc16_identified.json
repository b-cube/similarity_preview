Fixed-transit stations were placed at existing rail and bus transfer points or downtown commercial districts as well as locations in suburban, high-growth areas. The areas surrounding these stations accommodate a significant amount of future population, housing, and employment investment. The overall transportation network in Option B represents a balanced investment in roadways and transit.  The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan process study area includes the 35 southernmost parishes of Louisiana. </abstract> <purpose> The Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan developed transportation networks based on three alternative community growth options for planning districts in South Louisiana. Each option represents a distinct way for South Louisiana to accommodate an estimated 1.4 million new people and 1.1 million new jobs during the next 50 years.  The transportation networks are a fundamental component of the growth scenarios. The dispersed-development option (Option A) reflects an emphasis on roadways accessed by automobile, while the hybrid (Option B) and compact-development (Option C) scenarios feature greater transit infrastructure. The structure of each transportation option was based on the state DOTD network and further refined using input from the public and from regional MPO&apos;s.  Through the scenario-planning process, the people of Louisiana were given clear choices about their future, including comparisons between the costs and benefits of different futures. Armed with this concrete information, they made the meaningful choices that drive the Louisiana Speaks Regional Plan. </purpose> <supplinf> The development of the options for the Louisiana Speaks Regional Vision relies on scenario planning, which is widely used in business and military settings. Scenario planning was pioneered by Royal Dutch Shell in the 1970s and 1980s. Prior to that time, planners working for business and government spent much of their time trying to predict the future. Given the complexity of the business environment, the number of variables that deserve consideration, and the long time frame of many plans, it became apparent that getting the right prediction really wasn&apos;t possible or even necessary. What was needed was a way to put forth possible future options.  Scenarios illustrate what might be. They are not forecasts or predictions. Scenarios represent possible futures based on historic patterns and emerging trends. The Louisiana Speaks Regional Planning Team uses scenarios to evaluate a series of variables related to community growth, transportation systems, storm protection, and coastal restoration.  Three alternative community growth and transportation options integrated input from extensive research, Louisiana Speaks neighborhood planning charrettes, Louisiana Speak/FEMA ESF14 parish planning process, and six Louisiana Speaks regional planning workshops. The project team analyzed these future community growth and transportation options in concert with the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority&apos;s Preliminary Draft Master Plan for storm protection and coastal restoration. For more information on the CPRA plan, go to http://www.louisianacoastalplanning.org.  The planning team input scenarios into models resulting in detailed technical indicators. Indicators measured a series of possible outcomes ranging from the area of farmland developed to the estimated costs of building a transportation network. This technical information was presented as Louisiana citizens made decisions during the January/February 2007 Louisiana Speaks Regional Vision poll.
