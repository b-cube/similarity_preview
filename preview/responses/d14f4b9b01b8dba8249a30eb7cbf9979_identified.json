The study examined crime displacement and potential diffusion of benefits in and around five public housing developments that, since 2000, had been redeveloped using funds from HUD's HOPE VI initiative and other sources. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, three sites were selected for inclusion in the study. However, due to substantial overlap between the various target sites and displacement zones, the research team ultimately decided to aggregate the three sites into a single target area. A comparison area was then chosen based on recommendations from the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee (HACM). In Washington, DC, two HOPE VI sites were selected for inclusion in the study. Based on recommendations from the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), the research team selected a comparison site for each of the two target areas. Displacement areas were then drawn as concentric rings (\"buffers\") around the target areas in both Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Washington, DC. Address-level incident data were collected for the city of Milwaukee from the Milwaukee Police Department for the period January 2002 through February 2010. Incident data included all \"Group A\" offenses as classified under National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The research team classified the offenses into personal and property offenses. The offenses were aggregated into monthly counts, yielding 98 months of data (Part 1: Milwaukee, Wisconsin Data). Address-level data were also collected for Washington, DC from the Metropolitan Police Department for the time period January 2000 through September 2009. Incident data included all Part I offenses as classified under the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) system. The data were classified by researchers into personal and property offenses and aggregated by month, yielding 117 months of data (Part 2: Washington, DC Data). Part 1 contains 15 variables, while Part 2 contains a total of 27 variables. Both datasets include variables on the number of personal offenses reported per month, the number of property offenses reported per month, and the total number of incidents reported per month for each target site, buffer zone area (1000 feet or 2000 feet), and comparison site. Month and year indicators are also included in each dataset.         </abstract>                 <abstract>                                                <p>The purpose of this project was to conduct an evaluation of the impact on crime of the closing, renovation, and subsequent reopening of selected public housing developments under the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) initiative. Towards that end, the research team collected address-level incident data for Milwaukee, Wisconsin for 2002-2010 and Washington, DC for 2000-2009 in order to investigate three central research questions:</p> <list type=\"ordered\"> <itm>Does the closing of a large high-poverty public housing development under HOPE VI influence patterns of crime in and around that development and if so, how?</itm> <itm>Does crime displacement or diffusion of benefits result during the time that the development is closed for rebuilding and does crime return to previous levels when the development reopens? </itm> <itm>Do different methodologies for examining crime displacement and diffusion of benefits from public housing developments yield similar results, and which is most appropriate for studying displacement in this context?</itm> </list>                                    </abstract>                             <abstract>                                                <p>The study examined crime displacement and potential diffusion of benefits in and around five public housing developments that, since 2000, had been redeveloped using funds from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE VI) initiative and other sources.</p> <p> In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, three sites were selected for inclusion in the study: Cherry Court, Highland Gardens/Highland Homes and scattered public housing sites in the city's Midtown neighborhood. The \"scattered sites\" consisted of single and multifamily homes located near other public housing redevelopment sites. However, due to substantial overlap between the various target sites and displacement zones, the research team ultimately decided to aggregate the three sites into a single target area. A comparison area, Westlawn, was then chosen based on recommendations from the Housing Authority of the City of Milwaukee (HACM) of sites with similar housing stock, populations, residency requirements, and crime levels.</p> <p>In Washington, DC, two HOPE VI sites were selected for inclusion in the study: Capitol  Gateway and Arthur Capper/Carrollsburg. Both redevelopment sites had clearly delineated boundaries. Based on recommendations from the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA), the research team selected Barry Farms and Syphax/Greenleaf Gardens as the comparison sites for Capitol Gateway and Arthur Capper/Carrollsburg, respectively. Census data (not included in this dataset) revealed that the comparison sites had demographic and socioeconomic characteristics similar to those of their respective HOPE VI counterparts.</p> <p>Displacement areas were then drawn as concentric rings (\"buffers\") around the target areas in both Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Washington, DC. Specifically, two zones for displacement were delineated for each site: one ring that was 1000 feet from each site, and a circle that was 2000 feet from each site. The two buffer areas were mutually exclusive; that is, the area contained in the 2000 foot buffer did not include the area captured by the 1000 foot buffer. In Milwaukee, because the aggregated target zone was so large, the area contained in a 3000 foot buffer surrounding Westlawn, the comparable public housing development, was used as the comparison area. In Washington DC, only the actual areas of the comparison public housing sites were used.</p> <p>Address-level incident data were collected for the city of Milwaukee from the Milwaukee Police Department for the period January 2002 through February 2010. Incident data included all \"Group A\" offenses as classified under National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Addresses were then geocoded using a streetfile provided by the City of Milwaukee with a 100 percent match rate. The research team classified the offenses into personal (violent) and property offenses. Personal offenses included homicide, sexual offenses, assault offenses and kidnapping. The offenses were aggregated into monthly counts, yielding 98 months of data (Part 1).</p> <p> Address-level data were also collected for Washington, DC from the Metropolitan Police Department for the time period January 2000 through September 2009. Incident data included all Part I offenses as classified under the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) system. All data were provided with X and Y coordinates, so no geocoding was necessary. The data were classified by researchers into personal and property offenses and aggregated by month, yielding 117 months of data (Part 2).</p>                                    </abstract>                             <abstract>                    Part 1 contains 15 variables, while Part 2 contains a total of 27 variables. Both datasets include variables on the number of personal (violent) offenses reported per month, the number of property offenses reported per month, and the total number of incidents reported per month for each target site, buffer zone area (1000 feet or 2000 feet), and comparison site. Month and year indicators are also included in each dataset.           </abstract>                       <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2002-01\" cycle=\"P1\">2002-01</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2010-02\" cycle=\"P1\">2010-02</timePrd>                                                   <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2000-01\" cycle=\"P2\">2000-01</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2009-09\" cycle=\"P2\">2009-09</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2007-10\" cycle=\"P1\">2007-10</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2010-03\" cycle=\"P1\">2010-03</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>District of Columbia</geogCover>             <geogCover>Milwaukee</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>             <geogCover>Wisconsin</geogCover>                   <geogUnit>none</geogUnit>                   <anlyUnit>month/year</anlyUnit>                     <universe>All reported 'Group A' offenses as classified under the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) between January 2002 and February 2010 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (Part 1).
