This release of the data  includes members of the 104th Congress. Approximately 11,455  individuals are represented in this file, each identified by a unique  five-digit identification number. A data record exists for every  Congress in which an individual served, as well as for each chamber in  which a person may have served in a given Congress. To illustrate, a  member of the House of Representatives who is appointed to fill a  vacancy in the Senate during a term of service will have two data  records for that Congress. The congressional service variables include  political party affiliation, district, state and region represented,  and exact and cumulative dates of service in each Congress and each  chamber, as well as total congressional service. The biographical  variables cover state and region of birth, education, military  service, occupation, other political offices held, relatives who also  have held congressional office, reason for leaving each Congress, and  occupation and political offices held subsequent to service in  Congress. Many of these specific variables are summarized in a collapsed variable.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1789-03-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1789-03-04</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1996-11-27\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-11-27</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>All persons who have served in the United States Congress  from 1789 to November 27, 1996.</universe>                      <dataKind>biographical data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) BIOGRAPHICAL DIRECTORY OF THE AMERICAN CONGRESS,   1774-1989, (2) CONGRESSIONAL DIRECTORY, 1969-1988, (3) WEEKLY REPORT,   1979-1989, (4) Carroll McKibbin.
