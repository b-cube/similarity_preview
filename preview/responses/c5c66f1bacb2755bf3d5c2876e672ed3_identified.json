CaseRe3 is a resource for practitioners, educators, and researchers in the integrative healthcare disciplines. Practitioners can locate case reports on particular health conditions and find descriptions and results of treatment approaches across disciplines. Educators can find a rich source of teaching cases for problem-based learning and access a community of learning resources for teaching students about developing case reports.  Researchers can group case reports to develop virtual case series, estimate sample sizes, or find qualitative data on patient experience.</subtitle> <id xmlns=\"http://apache.org/cocoon/i18n/2.1\">https://casere3.dspacedirect.org:443</id> <updated>2014-10-21T18:09:53Z</updated> <dc:date>2014-10-21T18:09:53Z</dc:date> <entry> <title>Management of non-cardiac chest pain with chiropractic care: A case report and brief review</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/11106/40\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Cooper, Stephen R.</name> </author> <author> <name>Pfefer, Mark T.</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/11106/40</id> <updated>2014-09-25T03:32:06Z</updated> <published>2011-09-30T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Management of non-cardiac chest pain with chiropractic care: A case report and brief review Cooper, Stephen R.; Pfefer, Mark T. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this report is to discuss the outcome of a patient with non-cardiac chest pain treated with chiropractic spinal manipulation combined with instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization. INTRODUCTION: Chest pain is the fourth most common presentation in emergency rooms in the United States. The direct and indirect costs of chest pain are high in terms of disability, medication, repeated hospital admissions and physician visits, and costly diagnostic procedures. CLINICAL FEATURES: The case of a 45 year-old male presenting to a chiropractic clinic with complaints of chest pain is discussed. Although the source of this chest pain was likely non-cardiac, cardiac risk factors were present and were addressed as well. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was treated with manual thoracic spinal manipulation and instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization with complete resolution of chest pain at 3 weeks and no chest pain at 1 month and 3 month follow-up visits. Conservative cardiac prevention approaches were encouraged with good outcome. CONCLUSION: This case points out the promising role the combination of chiropractic manipulation and instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization may have in the management of non-cardiac chest pain arising from musculoskeletal dysfunction.

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how BJHS was diagnosed in two female patients with chronic pain and to present other associated history and examination findings on these same two patients. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two female patients, 27 and 32 years of age, with normal body mass indexes presented with a history of chronic spinal pain transiently lessened by multi-modal manual therapy. Each patient was diagnosed with BJHS. Both patients displayed joint hypermobility in the thumb(s), the fifth metacarpophalangeal joint and the lumbopelvic joints by having greater than normal range of motion in specific pre-determined directions. The 27 year old also had hyperextension of her elbows and myopia, while the 32 year had varicose veins and skin striae. Both had a history of back pain for greater than 3 months, key postural abnormalities and significant muscle imbalances. No treatment was administered to either patient since both patients were already currently receiving chiropractic treatment separate from this study.&#13; DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of BJHS can be challenging due to no gold standard test, however it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds an important entity to consider because of its unique characteristics and management implications. CONCLUSION: A detailed description of two patients with BJHS is presented. It is important for doctors to be aware of BJHS and to be able to diagnose it so these types of patients can be managed appropriately.

Rupture of the quadriceps tendon is an uncommon but severe injury that&#13; has a long recovery period and risk of sequelae especially when repair is delayed.&#13; This article presents a case of ruptured quadriceps tendon complicated by a postoperative&#13; wound infection causing a six-month delay of definitive surgical&#13; treatment. This paper discusses therapy following resolution of the wound infection&#13; (to prepare the patient for definitive repair) and therapy following repair (to restore&#13; the subject to previous levels of competitive activity).

The goal of this&#13; study is a return to full ROM, decrease pain, as well as&#13; complete return to activity.&#13; CASE SELECTION: Individuals, males or females, between the&#13; ages of 18 and 40 with no history of an inversion ankle sprain&#13; in the past 24 months would be acceptable for this study. A&#13; 23 year old female with no prior inversion sprain in the past&#13; 36 months was used for this case report.&#13; METHODS: A protocol of five sixty minute treatments over a&#13; period of 21 days was strictly adhered to. Manual and&#13; Massage Therapy techniques were applied. The majority of&#13; each treatment was comprised of Active Myofascial Release,&#13; denoted as (AMR), and transverse frictions. The focus of the&#13; treatments was on the lateral ankle ligaments along with the&#13; tendons that cross the ankle complex. However, osseous,&#13; capsular, muscular, and superficial tissues in the area were&#13; also affected.&#13; RESULTS: Patient experienced an increase in dorsi and plantar&#13; flexion as well as an increase daily activities and decrease in&#13; pain in the affected limb.&#13; Conclusion: For this patient, manual and massage therapy&#13; techniques in conjunction with hydrotherapy and rehabilitation&#13; exercises are able to return lost range of motion (dorsi &amp;&#13; plantar flexion) to an ankle in the chronic stage of an inversion&#13; sprain injury. However, further research needs to be compiled&#13; to derive the efficacy of the protocol used on the pathology&#13; rather than the patient.
