Genetic variation is associated with differences in the function of the brain as well as its susceptibility to disease. The common H1 haplotypic variant of the microtubule-associated protein tau gene (MAPT) has been related to an increased risk for Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, among PD patients, H1 homozygotes have an accelerated progression to dementia. We investigated the neurocognitive correlates of MAPT haplotypes using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Thirty-seven nondemented patients with PD (19 H1/H1, 18 H2 carriers) and 40 age-matched controls (21 H1/H1, 19 H2 carriers) were scanned during performance of a picture memory encoding task. Behaviorally, H1 homozygosity was associated with impaired picture recognition memory in PD patients and control subjects. These impairments in the H1 homozygotes were accompanied by an altered blood-oxygen level-dependent response in the medial temporal lobe during successful memory encoding. Additional age-related differences in blood-oxygen level-dependent response were observed in the medial temporal lobes of H1 homozygotes with PD. These results suggest that common variation in MAPT is not only associated with the dementia of PD but also differences in the neural circuitry underlying aspects of cognition in normal aging.

We investigate the hypothesis that reactivation of plasticity can restore function in the presence of neuronal damage resulting from tauopathy. We investigated two models with tau hyperphosphorylation, aggregation and neurodegeneration: a transgenic mouse model in which the mutant P301S tau is expressed in neurons (Tg P301S), and a model in which an adeno-associated virus expressing P301S tau (AAV-P301S) was injected in the perirhinal cortex, a region critical for object recognition (OR) memory. Both models show profound loss of OR memory despite only 15% neuronal loss in the Tg P301S and 26% in AAV-P301S-injected mice. Recordings from perirhinal cortex slices of 3 month-old P301S transgenic mice showed a diminution in synaptic transmission following temporal stimulation. Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) can reactivate plasticity and affect memory through actions on perineuronal nets. ChABC was injected into the perirhinal cortex and animals were tested for OR memory 1 week later, demonstrating restoration of OR memory to normal levels. Synaptic transmission indicated by fEPSP amplitude was restored to control levels following ChABC treatment. ChABC did not affect the progression of neurodegenerative tauopathy. These findings suggest that increasing plasticity by manipulation of perineuronal nets offers a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of memory loss in neurodegenerative disorders.

L.; Kasis, A.; Yuan, Y.; Mason, S. L.; Lazar, A. S.; Barker, R. A.; Gon\\ufffd\\ufffdalves, J. Background The lack of reliable biomarkers to track disease progression is a major&#13; problem in clinical research of chronic neurological disorders. Using Huntington\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds&#13; disease (HD) as an example, we describe a novel approach to model HD and show that&#13; the progression of a neurological disorder can be predicted for individual patients.&#13; Methods Starting with an initial cohort of 343 HD patients that we have followed since&#13; 1995, we used data from 68 patients that satisfied our filtering criteria to model disease&#13; progression, based on the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), a&#13; measure that is routinely used in HD clinics worldwide.&#13; Results Our model was validated using: a) extrapolating our equation to model the age of&#13; disease onset, b) testing it on a second patient dataset by loosening our filtering criteria,&#13; c) cross-validating with a repeated random sub-sampling approach, and d) holdout&#13; validating with the latest clinical assessment data from the same cohort of patients. With&#13; UHDRS scores from the past four clinical visits (over a minimum span of two years), our&#13; model predicts disease progression of individual patients over the next two years with an&#13; accuracy of 89-91%. We have also provided evidence that patients with similar baseline&#13; clinical profiles can exhibit very different trajectories of disease progression.&#13; Conclusion This new model therefore has important implications for HD research, most&#13; obviously in the development of potential disease-modifying therapies. We believe that&#13; similar approach can also be adapted to model disease progression in other chronic&#13; neurological disorders.

Using cerebral impedance methodology, we sought to assess the behavior of CrCP during CVS. As CrCP expresses the sum of intracranial pressure (ICP) and vascular wall tension, we also explored its role in reflecting changes in vascular tone occurring in small vessels distal to spasm. &#13; &#13; This retrospective analysis was performed using recordings from 52 patients, diagnosed with CVS through transcranial Doppler measurements. CrCP was calculated non-invasively using arterial blood pressure and blood flow velocity. Outcome was assessed at both discharge and 3 months after ictus with the Glasgow Outcome Scale.&#13; &#13; The onset of CVS caused significant decreases in CrCP (p=0.025), without any observed significant changes in ICP (p=0.134). Vasospasm induced asymmetry, with CrCP ipsilateral to CVS becoming significantly lower than contralateral (p=0.025). Unfavorable outcomes were associated with a significantly lower CrCP after the onset of CVS (discharge: p=0.014; 3 months post SAH: p=0.020).&#13; &#13; CrCP is reduced in the presence of CVS in both temporal and spatial assessments. As ICP remained unchanged during CVS, reduced CrCP most probably reflects a lower wall tension in dilated small vessels distal to spasm. This is the accepted manuscript.
