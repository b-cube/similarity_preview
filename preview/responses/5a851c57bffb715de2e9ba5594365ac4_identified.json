The occupancy rate is calculated as a ratio between transport performance (passenger-kilometres) and the supplied vehicle kilometres. A vehicle-kilometre is a unit of measurement representing movement of a vehicle over one kilometre.    Percentage (%) of available seats occupied, passenger-kilometres and vehicle-km.    Vehicle occupancy rates can be used to explain changes in levels of vehicle ownership and to illustrate changes in the efficiency of mass passenger transport. Efficient usage of passenger vehicles results in the need for less vehicle-kilometres to transport the same number of passengers. Utilisation efficiency is one of the main parameters that determine energy and emissions efficiency, meaning that the vehicle occupancy indicator is important in relation to the environmental impact of different transport modes.   Passenger transport occupancy rate (%) is monitored for air, cars, bus/coach, and train. Car occupancy rate is assessed by the number of passengers per vehicle. Other relevant indicators are passenger km: cars, bus/coach, air, train, tram, metro, vessel (inland and sea); and vehicle km: cars, bus/coach, air, train, tram, metro, vessel (inland and sea). Inland and sea transport occupancy is not monitored.    No uncertainty has been specified.    The total number of vehicle-kilometres can be significantly reduced if the efficiency of passenger transport (in terms of vehicle occupancy rates) increases. Consequently, fewer vehicles would be needed to transport the same number of persons, which would help to combat congestion and avert environmental damage. A potential downside is reduced passenger comfort due to fuller vehicles.   Measures to increase occupancy rates for cars include schemes for favouring vehicles with more than one occupant (through-traffic privileges and financial incentives). There are no explicit targets for this indicator at EU level, and neither are there any policy targets for car sharing programs. There are, however, a number of different initiatives in place to increase levels of car occupancy. Private companies are, for example, increasingly promoting car sharing. Some member states have also developed policies for improving transport occupancy rates.    No targets have been specified.
