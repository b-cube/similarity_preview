The Concept Journal offers a lively independent forum for critical debate and exchange of ideas in contemporary Community Education. Community Education is seen in the broadest sense to include community work, adult education and youth work and takes place in a range of settings and agencies. We see the concept of community education as dynamic and diverse and do not seek to reflect a fixed view.</description>              <dc:language>en-US</dc:language>      <prism:publicationName>Concept</prism:publicationName>               <prism:issn>1359 1983</prism:issn>         <prism:copyright>&lt;p&gt;Authors who publish with this journal agree to the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a.

Allied to this, there is a growing movement to privatise those areas of public services that could be run for profit, including higher education.&lt;p&gt;New managerialism represents the organisational arm of neoliberalism. It is the mode of governance designed to realize the neoliberal project through the institutionalising of market principles in the governance of organizations. While Taylorism and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdscientific management have been employed extensively to for-profit businesses for many decades, what makes new managerialism \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnew\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is the deployment of managerialist principles in both public sector bodies (Lynch, Grummell and Devine, 2012), and, increasingly, in non-governmental organisations (McCrea, 2014).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Kathleen Lynch</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-24</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-24</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>5</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://concept.lib.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Concept/article/view/272\">        <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRight, I can do this now\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. Community Based Adult Learning, Health and Well-being</title>    <link>http://concept.lib.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Concept/article/view/272</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article explores the experiences of participants in community based adult learning (CBAL) in relation to health and well-being. It draws on data from a small-scale life history study undertaken with 10 adult learners in two local authority areas in Scotland. The article concludes that, for some learners, participation in CBAL had contributed to a sense of well-being and was seen by them as supporting their capacity to cope with ill-health.\\ufffd\\ufffd In addition, it is suggested that community based adult learning can play a role in the recovery from mental ill-health and depression.\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Janis McIntyre</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-24</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-24</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>5</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://concept.lib.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Concept/article/view/273\">        <title>Imagining a different future</title>    <link>http://concept.lib.ed.ac.uk/index.php/Concept/article/view/273</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most providers engage in evaluation but, often, there is little opportunity to record in any depth the experience of returning to learning and the difference it has made to learners.
