The scale of source material is 1:2,500,000 and these data are not intended for use at a larger scale.</purpose>    <supplinf>    The Ada-Vamoosa aquifer underlies an area of about 2,300 square miles in east-central Oklahoma. The aquifer is in the Central Lowland Physiographic Province and underlies parts of Creek, Lincoln, Okfuskee, Osage, Pawnee, Payne, Pontotoc, Pottawatomie, and Seminole Counties. The aquifer extends in a band about 10 to 20 miles wide from northern Pontotoc County northward into Kansas. Several towns in the area rely entirely or in part on ground water for municipal supply.     HYDROGEOLOGY The Ada-Vamoosa aquifer, also cited in the literature as the \"Vamoosa-Ada aquifer,\" consists mainly of layers of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone irregularly interbedded with shale and limestone. The rocks are in the Ada and the Vamoosa Groups of Pennsylvanian age. The maximum thickness of the aquifer is about 900 feet. Aggregate thickness of the more permeable water-yielding sandstones in the aquifer is greatest south of the Cimarron River, where the maximum thickness is 550 feet. North of the river, the average aggregate thickness of sandstones is about 100 feet. The aquifer is unconfined in the east where it is near land surface; in downdip areas to the west, it is confined.     The regional dip of the Ada-Vamoosa aquifer is toward the west at about 30 to 90 feet per mile. The regional easterly slope of the water table is similar to that of the land surface. The approximate maximum thickness of the zone thatcontains water with a dissolved-solids concentration of less than 1,500 milligrams per liter decreases from 900 feet in the southern part of the area to 400 feet in the northern part. The total amount of water with dissolved solids of less than 1,500 milligrams per liter that is stored in the sandstone layers is estimated to be 60 million acre-feet. The amount of water that is theoretically available from storage is estimated to be 36 million acre-feet.     Generally, the water in the Ada-Vamoosa aquifer is a sodium-potassium chloride-sulfate type with a concentration of dissolved solids of less than 500 milligrams per liter. Yields of wells completed in the aquifer are commonly 25 to 150 gallons per minute, and are as much as 300 gallons per minute.     GROUND-WATER DEVELOPMENT     The Ada-Vamoosa aquifer is an important source of water for several towns in the area, as well as for some industries. Excessive pumpage may cause upward movement of saline water from the deeper, confined part of the aquifer. Brines and wastes from past oil-field operations might have caused some local contamination of the freshwater in the aquifer.     During 1980, withdrawals from the Ada-Vamoosa aquifer totaled 10 million gallons per day and were mostly for public and industrial supplies. During 1985, the withdrawals were reported for the combined Ada-Vamoosa and Central Oklahoma aquifers. Withdrawals from the Ada-Vamoosa aquifer were about 12 million gallons per day during 1985.     The juxtaposition of regionally mapped aquifers has led to some instances where an aquifer outcrop or shallow subcrop is bounded by a State line. This is a result of the regional mapping and national categorization methods used and is not meant to imply a hydrogeologic change coincident with a State boundary.

Aquifer names and all or part of the outcrop line shown on the Nationwide 'Principal Aquifer' map (Miller, James A., 1998), were used with the extent of each aquifer from the various chapters of the 'Ground Water Atlas of the United States' to create this coverage. The largest scale map source available was used. Where the line defining the aquifer extent is the same as the outcrop, the data were copied from the Principal Aquifers data set. Otherwise data were traced from 1:7,500,000, 1:5,000,000, or 1:2,500,000 scale map sources onto a stable base material. Where the extent was defined by a coastline, the 1:2,000,000scale Hydrography Features of the U.S. was used. (The following steps were done using ARC/INFO 7.2.1 on Data General AViiON UNIX. Much of the terminology used will be specific to ARC/INFO).     b.) The aquifer extent lines were digitized into ARCEDIT using standard USGStolerances. After digitizing, a check plot was created and reviewed against the traced map. If a line was located more than a line weight (0.05\") from the digitized source, it was corrected during an ARCEDIT session.     c.) Using the TRANSFORM command, the coverage containing the digitized, aquifer extent lines was combined with the coverage containing registration tics, was rubbersheeted from geographic to Albers EqualArea Conic projection. An RMS error of less than 0.004 was accepted. If it was greater than 0.004 the location and values of the lat/long points were verified. Following this transformation, any aquifer lines from the aquifer extent coverage coincidental to aquifer lines from the 'Principal Aquifers' map data set were copied from the 'Principal Aquifers' map data set and put into the aquifer extent coverage. The aquifer extent coverage was cleaned, the topology was built, and labels were added.     d.) Four items were added to the .PAT file:  AQ_NAME (60 65 C)  AQ_CODE (4 5 I),  ROCK_NAME (40 45 C),  ROCK_TYPE (4 5 I).  ROCK_NAME comes from the Principal Aquifers Data set, 1998.     The first digit of the three digit aq_code, refers to aquifer lithology.  100 series are numbers for unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers  200 series are numbers for semiconsolidated sand aquifers  300 series are numbers for sandstone aquifers  400 series are numbers for carbonate-rock aquifers  500 series are numbers for sandstone and carbonate-rock aquifers  600 series are numbers for volcanic-rock aquifers  999 is given for non aquifer islands inside aquifer polygons     e.) The following items were verified:  --Digitizing RMS error (below 0.005)  --Transformation RMS error (below 0.004)  --Arcs match the traced mylar (no gaps between the plot and the compilation)  --Arc and polygon topology exists  --Coverage has a coordinate system defined  --Attributes aq_name and aq_code have been added and populated correctly  --Necessary files exist to redo any step</procdesc>     <procdate>19970331</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>This step was done on an NT workstation. After plotting the extent at 1:2,000,000, the lines were checked with the documented sources. If needed, the lines were corrected to better represent the source data. This process may have included one or more of the following steps: Reshaping the arc Replacing the arc from the outcrop data, --Digitizing new lines polygons --Deleting polygons.</procdesc>     <procdate>19991118</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Due to a computer problem final corrected files were lost, however hard copy plots of those files were retained. This file was recreated from those plots using a similar process to that described above. Where extent lines were equal to the outcrop, data were extracted from the Principal Aquifers Data Set. Otherwise data were digitized from the retained hard copy plots using the same tolerances and software described above. A check plot was created and compared to the hard copy plot. Significant deviations, greater than approximately a line weight (0.005\\ufffd\\ufffd), were corrected using ARCEDIT. Data were reviewed internally to assure compliance with original sources.</procdesc>     <procdate>20000712</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>First draft of metadata created by J.M.
