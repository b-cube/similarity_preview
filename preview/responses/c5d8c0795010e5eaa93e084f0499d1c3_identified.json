Data are derived from California Office of Drinking Water (ODW) Water Quality Monitoring Database (WQMD, also know as Water Quality Inventory or WQI) and Permits, Inspection, Compliance, Monitoring, and Enforcement (PICME) database. The data set contains one record for each Community Water System (CWS) and includes additional detail about how many retail connections and how many people are served by each CWS.</abstract> <purpose>This data set contributes to the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The EPHT cooperative agreement states that all grantees must track and make available core environmental health tracking measures on the State and National EPHT Network, including data/information on key water contaminants, as defined through the Content workgroup process. The Content Workgroup Water Team identified initial contaminants of concern for the national EPHT program, identified nationally consistent data sources, and developed nationally consistent indicators and measures. This data set can be used to enumerate all Community Water Systems in California. Using the Public Water System ID Number, it can be joined with any of the other 3 datasets that accompany this: Quarterly Indicators, Annual Indicators, and Facility Locations</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19990101</begdate> <begtime/> <enddate>20081231</enddate> <endtime/> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Two times per year</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.409721</westbc> <eastbc>-114.131208</eastbc> <northbc>42.009521999999997</northbc> <southbc>32.53416</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>NONE</themekt> <themekey>hazard</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California,CA,06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>none</accconst> <useconst> The principal county and city served variables designate the principal county or city which the community water system serves; Multiple CWS can serve the same county or city and multiple counties or cities can be served by a single CWS.

WQMD and PICME are coded logically to successfully ascertain active CWS, however, a small minority of active CWS only export drinking water to other CWS with a non-zero retail population. For this reason, the legal definition (i.e. serving 15 retail connections or 25 people, year-round) of a CWS was also used in populating the CWS inventory. 3070 CWS were enumerated by this logic.&#13;&#13; CWS-specific population-served estimates are often inaccurate, because individual water systems are given 3 options for performing this calculation:  1. using the US Census and/or CA Department of Finance, 2, multiplying the number of service connections by 3.3, and/or 3. estimating the population served for single connections that provide service to multiple dwelling establishments, such as mobile home parks, apartments, prisons, and other institutional facilities with permanent residents.  As of November 2009, according to PICME and reported through this dataset, the total CWS population served was 40,547,409, whereas the US Census reports the CA population in 2008 as 36,756,666. Moreover, estimates of public drinking water use by USGS and from the 1990 Census found that only 85-90% of the CA population is served by CWS. Statewide, this means that the population served estimate as reported by this dataset may be 20-25% higher than the true value. </logic> <complete>By definition, this dataset does not include unregulated drinking water providers, namely private drinking water wells or very small systems or mutuals in which there are less than 15 retail connections and less than 25 year-round residents. </complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>Developed SQL statement for creating CWS Inventory table.  Primary logic holds PICME_SYSNUM1.PWS_CLASS=&#39;C&#39; and PICME_SYSNUM1.P_M_STATUS=&#39;A&#39; and ((PICME_SYSNUM1.CONNECTIONS>=15 and PICME_SYSNUM1.POPULATION>0) or PICME_SYSNUM1.POPULATION>=25) to select only Community Water Systems that are Active and with either 15+ connections or 25+ population served, respectively.  The logic for determining optional Primary Source Code departs from EPA Surface Water Treatment Rule logic; If all the active sources contained in a water system are all of one source type (ie. GW, SWP, SW, GWP, GU, or GUP), then the system is attributed with that source type, otherwise it is attributed as missing.</procdesc> <procdate>20100501</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Downloaded Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) feature types and codes from geonames.usgs.gov and extracted feature ID based on joining the the county FIPS code and the city location name in PICME_SYNUM1 field.
