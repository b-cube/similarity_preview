The   1993 census included all locally administered confinement facilities   (3,287) that held inmates beyond arraignment and were staffed by   municipal or county employees. The census also included 17 jails that   were privately operated under contract for local governments and seven   facilities maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and functioning   as jails. For purposes of this data collection, a local jail was   defined as a confinement facility intended for holding adults, and in   some cases juveniles pending adjudication or having sentences of a year   or less. Jails were further defined as being administered by a local   law enforcement agency. Variables include information on jail   population by legal status, age, and sex of prisoners, maximum   sentence, admissions and releases, available services and programs,   structure and capacity, facility age and use of space, expenditure,   employment, staff information, and health issues, which include  statistics on drugs, AIDS, and tuberculosis.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1992-07-01\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-07-01</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1993-06-30\" cycle=\"P1\">1993-06-30</timePrd>                                                           <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1993-06-30\" cycle=\"P1\">1993-06-30</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>All locally-administered jails in the United States.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          official records             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to   these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><list type=\"bulleted\">  <itm>Performed consistency checks.</itm><itm>Standardized missing values.</itm><itm>Performed recodes and/or calculated derived variables.</itm><itm>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</itm>  </list>  </cleanOps>              </dataColl>       <notes>                 (1) Excluded from the census were temporary holding   facilities, such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold   persons after they are formally charged in court (usually within 72   hours of arrest). Also excluded were state-operated facilities in   Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which   have combined jail-prison systems. Five locally-operated jails in   Alaska were included. (2) The data collection instrument is provided as   an electronic file in Portable Document File (PDF) format. The PDF   format was developed by Adobe Systems Incorporated and can be accessed   using the Adobe Acrobat Reader. Information on how to obtain a copy of   the Acrobat Reader is provided in the README file on the diskette   version of this study and through the NACJD Website on the Internet.

Accordingly, any intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment may violate federal law as well as the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information. Therefore, users of data collected by or with the support from the U.S. Department of Justice and distributed by NACJD or other ICPSR archives must agree to abide by these regulations and understand that ICPSR may report any potential violation to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>                                    <p>AVAILABLE.
