Applicants are often extremely experienced, talented individuals who   are donating their time both \"on the clock\" and \"after hours\"   improving or extending the GNU software or other free software   projects that their employers depend on.  Additionally, applicants   are often more than willing to help their employers connect (or   remain connected) to the free software community so that further   contributions to enterprise-critical projects can be gained from a   network of thousands of people, from independent programmers to   other employers just like you. It is for this reason that I highly   recommend the GNU jobs page to employers serious about their   commitment to using and/or building upon free and/or GNU   software.</p> </blockquote>  <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <strong>Ready to list?</strong> Just email your listing to <a href=\"mailto:job-page@fsf.org\">&lt;job-page@fsf.org&gt;</a> and we'll post it just as soon as <a href=\"https://my.fsf.org/payment/job-payment\">payment is received</a>. </p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator></dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2008-03-24T20:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Document</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.fsf.org/resources/jobs/new/faq\">     <title>Frequently Asked Questions</title>     <link>http://www.fsf.org/resources/jobs/new/faq</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<dl>    <dt>How much does it cost to post a job?</dt>  <dd>USD 250 for 30 days.
