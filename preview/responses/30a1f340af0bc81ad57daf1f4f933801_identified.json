We examined the epidemiological and social impact of KA in an affected village in Bangladesh. A population-based survey of the village residents showed a case fatality rate of 14.7% among females and 5.3% among males. Before initiation of the study, female patients were ill longer than males before they received treatment. Future work needs to focus on understanding the implications of KA on women and to develop sustainable strategies for appropriate and timely access to treatment. &lt;br&gt;</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://dspace.icddrb.org:80/dspace/handle/123456789/5677\">     <title>The role of public health programmes in reducing socioeconomic inequities in childhood immunization coverage</title>     <link>http://dspace.icddrb.org:80/dspace/handle/123456789/5677</link>     <description>title: The role of public health programmes in reducing socioeconomic inequities in childhood immunization coverage authors: Bishai, David; Suzuki, Emi; McQuestion, Michael; Chakraborty, Jyostnamoy; Koenig, Michael &lt;br&gt;abstract: Abstract&#xD; OBJECTIVES:&#xD; &#xD; This paper asks whether intensive outreach services can eliminate socioeconomic differentials in vaccine coverage.&#xD; METHODS:&#xD; &#xD; In 1990, the Matlab Maternal and Child Health/Family Planning Project (MCH-FP) surveyed 4238 respondents in an intervention area that received outreach and 3708 respondents in a comparison area in rural Bangladesh. Interacted multiple regression methods assessed the degree to which various socioeconomic indicators predicted the probability of vaccine receipt in each area.&#xD; RESULTS:&#xD; &#xD; Low parental schooling, small dwelling size and female gender were significantly associated with incomplete vaccination in the comparison area, where only the limited government services existed. Residence in the MCH-FP outreach area greatly reduced, and in some cases eliminated, the effects of these socioeconomic barriers to vaccine receipt.&#xD; CONCLUSIONS:&#xD; &#xD; Public health programmes utilizing outreach can reduce prevailing gender and socioeconomic differentials in vaccine receipt. &lt;br&gt;</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://dspace.icddrb.org:80/dspace/handle/123456789/5676\">     <title>Prevalence of the pandemic genotype of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and significance of its distribution across different serotypes.</title>     <link>http://dspace.icddrb.org:80/dspace/handle/123456789/5676</link>     <description>title: Prevalence of the pandemic genotype of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and significance of its distribution across different serotypes. authors: Bhuiyan, N.A.; Ansaruzzaman, M.; Kamruzzaman, M.; Alam, K,; Chowdhury, N.R.; Nishibuchi, M.; Faruque, Shah M.; Sack, David A.; Takeda, Yoshifumi; Nair, G.Balakrish &lt;br&gt;abstract: Abstract&#xD; &#xD; Sixty-six strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus belonging to 14 serotypes were isolated from hospitalized patients in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from January 1998 to December 2000. Among these, 48 strains belonging to four serotypes had the pandemic genotype and possessed the tdh gene. A marker (open reading frame ORF8) for a filamentous phage previously thought to correspond to the pandemic genotype was found to have a poor correlation with the pandemic genotype &lt;br&gt;</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://dspace.icddrb.org:80/dspace/handle/123456789/5675\">     <title>Beneficial effects of a woman-focused development programme on child survival: evidence from rural Bangladesh</title>     <link>http://dspace.icddrb.org:80/dspace/handle/123456789/5675</link>     <description>title: Beneficial effects of a woman-focused development programme on child survival: evidence from rural Bangladesh authors: Bhuiya, Abbas; Chowdhury, Mushtaque &lt;br&gt;abstract: Abstract&#xD; &#xD; This paper reports results from a prospective study of the impact of a woman-focused development programme on child survival in Matlab, a rural area of Bangladesh. The programme was targeted to households owning less than 50 decimals of land and members selling more than 100 days of labour for living in a year. Programme components included formation of women's groups for saving and credit, training on skill development, functional literacy including legal and social awareness, and technical and marketing support to projects undertaken with the loan money from the organization. A total of 13,549 children born alive during 1988-97 in the study area were included in the study. Hazards of mortality during pre- and post-intervention periods were compared among the programme participants and non-participants controlling the effects of other relevant variables. There has been a substantial reduction in mortality during the post-intervention period; however, the reduction was much greater for infants whose mothers participated in the development programme compared to infants of non-participant mothers from similar socioeconomic background. In a relative sense, there has been a 52% reduction of the pre-intervention level hazard of death of children during infancy of participant mothers compared to 31% reduction for the infants of non-participant mothers from similar socioeconomic background. There had also been a substantial reduction in hazard of death during childhood (1-4 year age group), however, the reduction was statistically similar for all groups of children irrespective of their mothers' participation in the development programmes &lt;br&gt;</description>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
