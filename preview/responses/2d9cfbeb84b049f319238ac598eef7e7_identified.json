Following their endosymbiotic uptake, plastids undergo profound changes to genome content and to their associated biochemistry. I have investigated how evolutionary transitions in plastid genomes may impact on biochemical pathways associated with plastid gene expression, focusing on the highly unusual plastids found in one group of eukaryotes, the alveolates. The principal photosynthetic alveolate lineage is the dinoflagellate algae. Most dinoflagellate species harbour unusual plastids derived from red algae. The genome of this plastid has been fragmented into small, plasmid-like elements termed \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdminicircles\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. Transcripts of this genome receive a 3\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd poly(U) tail and, in some species, undergo extensive sequence editing. Some dinoflagellates have replaced their original plastids with others, in a process termed \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdserial endosymbiosis\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The major non-photosynthetic alveolates are the apicomplexans, which include the malaria parasite Plasmodium. Apicomplexans are descended from free-living algae and possess a vestigial plastid, which originated through the same endosymbiosis as the ancestral red dinoflagellate plastid. This plastid has lost all genes involved in photosynthesis and does not possess a poly(U) tail addition pathway.&#13; &#13; I have investigated the consequences of the fragmentation of the red algal dinoflagellate plastid genome on plastid transcription. I have characterised non-coding transcripts in plastids of the dinoflagellate Amphidinium carterae, including the first evidence for antisense transcripts in an algal plastid. Antisense transcripts in dinoflagellate plastids do not receive poly(U) tails, suggesting that poly(U) tail addition may play a role in strand discrimination during transcript processing.&#13; &#13; I have additionally characterised transcript processing in dinoflagellate plastids that were acquired through serial endosymbiosis. I have shown that poly(U) tail addition and editing occur in the haptophyte-derived serial endosymbionts of the fucoxanthin-containing dinoflagellates Karenia mikimotoi and Karlodinium veneficum. This is the first evidence that plastids acquired through serial endosymbiosis may be supported by pathways retained from previous symbioses. Transcript editing constrains the phenotypic consequences of divergent mutations in fucoxanthin plastid genomes, whereas poly(U) tail addition plays a central role in recognising and processing translationally functional fucoxanthin plastid mRNAs. I have additionally shown that certain genes within fucoxanthin plastids are located on minicircles. This demonstrates convergent evolution in the organisation of the fucoxanthin and red algal dinoflagellate plastid genomes since their endosymbiotic acquisition.&#13; &#13; Finally, I have investigated transcript processing in the algae Chromera velia and Vitrella brassicaformis. These species are closely related to apicomplexans but are still photosynthetic and apply poly(U) tails to plastid transcripts, as with dinoflagellates. I have shown that poly(U) tails in these species are preferentially associated with translationally functional mRNAs of photosynthesis genes. This is the first plastid transcript processing pathway documented to target a specific functional gene category. Poly(U) tail addition may direct transcript cleavage and allow photosynthesis gene transcripts to accumulate to high levels. The loss of this pathway from ancestors of apicomplexans may have contributed to their transition from photosynthesis to parasitism. </description> <dc:date>2014-10-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245345\"> <title>Preserving hyperpolarised nuclear spin order to study cancer metabolism</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245345</link> <description>Preserving hyperpolarised nuclear spin order to study cancer metabolism Marco-Rius, Irene Monitoring the early responses of tumours to treatment is a crucial element in guiding therapy and increasing patient survival. To achieve this, we are using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which can provide detailed physiological information with relatively high temporal and spatial resolution. In combination with the dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP) technique, high signal-to-noise is obtained, resulting in a powerful tool for in vivo 13C metabolic imaging. However, detection of hyperpolarised substrates is limited to a few seconds due to the exponential decay of the polarisation with the longitudinal relaxation time constant T1.&#13; This work aimed to improve the combination of hyperpolarisation and metabolic NMR/ MRI by extending the observation timescale of the technique. Working with quantum mechanical properties of the detected substrates, long lifetimes might be accessible by using the nuclear singlet configuration of two coupled nuclei. The singlet state is immune to intramolecular dipole-dipole relaxation processes, which is one of the main sources of signal decay in MRI. In favourable situations, the singlet relaxation time constant can be much longer than T1, so transfer of the polarisation into the singlet state may allow one to extend the usable time period of the nuclear hyperpolarisation.&#13; Here we studied the relaxation of hyperpolarised metabolites, including those found in the TCA cycle, and examined the possibility of extending their observation timescale by storing the polarisation in the long-lived singlet state. The polarisation remains in this state until it is eventually required for imaging. We also investigate how one may track polarised metabolites after injection into a subject due to the transfer of polarisation to the solvent by Overhauser cross-relaxation, so that the 13C polarisation remains untouched until imaging is required. In this way we should be able to interrogate slower metabolic processes than have been examined hitherto using hyperpolarised 13C MRS, and better understand metabolic changes induced in tumours by treatment. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245284\"> <title>The role of post-transcriptional regulators in pathogenesis and secondary metabolite production in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006.</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245284</link> <description>The role of post-transcriptional regulators in pathogenesis and secondary metabolite production in Serratia sp. ATCC 39006. Wilf, Nabil Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 (S39006) is a Gram-negative bacterium that is virulent in plant (potato) and animal (Caenorhabditis elegans) models. It produces two secondary metabolite antibiotics, prodigiosin and a carbapenem, and the plant cell wall degrading exoenzymes, pectate lyase and cellulase. A complex regulatory network controls production of prodigiosin, including a quorum sensing (QS) system, and the role of post-transcriptional regulation was investigated. It was hypothesized that Hfq-dependent small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) might also play a role. Hfq is an RNA chaperone involved in post-transcriptional regulation that plays a key role in stress response and virulence in other bacterial species. An S39006 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhfq mutant was constructed and in the mutants production of prodigiosin and carbapenem was abolished, while production of the QS molecule, butanoyl homoserine lactone (BHL), was unaffected. Using transcriptional fusions, it was found that Hfq regulated the QS response regulators, SmaR and CarR. Additionally, exoenzyme production and swimming motility were decreased in the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhfq mutant, and virulence was attenuated in potato and C. elegans. It was also shown that the phenotype of an hfq mutant is independent of its role in regulating the stationary phase sigma factor, rpoS. In order to define the complete regulon of Hfq and identify relevant potential sRNAs, deep sequencing of strand-specific cDNAs (RNA-seq) was used to analyse the whole transcriptome of S39006 WT and the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhfq mutant. The regulon of another post-transcriptional regulator, RsmA, also involved in regulating prodigiosin production, was investigated by performing RNA-seq on an rsmA mutant. Moreover, global changes in the proteome of the hfq mutant was analysed using an LC-MS/MS approach with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ). This study confirms a role for Hfq in pathogenesis and the regulation of antibiotic production in S39006, and begins to provide a systems-level understanding of Hfq and RsmA regulation using a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics. </description> <dc:date>2011-07-12T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245207\"> <title>Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245207</link> <description>Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity Shafee, Thomas The aim of this thesis is to investigate aspects of molecular evolution and enzyme engineering using the experimental evolution of Tobacco Etch Virus cysteine protease (TEV) as a model. I map key features of the local fitness landscape and characterise how they affect details of enzyme evolution.&#13; In order to investigate the evolution of core active site machinery, I mutated the nucleophile of TEV to serine. The differing chemical properties of oxygen and sulphur force the enzyme into a fitness valley with a &gt;104-fold activity reduction. Nevertheless, directed evolution was able to recover function, resulting in an enzyme able to utilise either nucleophile. High-throughput screening and sequencing revealed how the array of possible beneficial mutations changes as the enzyme evolves. Potential adaptive mutations are abundant at each step along the evolutionary trajectory, enriched around the active site periphery. &#13; It is currently unclear how seemingly neutral mutations affect further adaptive evolution. I used high-throughput directed evolution to accumulate neutral variation in large, evolving enzyme populations and deep sequencing to reconstruct the complex evolutionary dynamics within the lineages. Specifically I was able to observe the emergence of robust enzymes with improved mutation tolerance whose descendants overtake later populations. &#13; Lastly, I investigate how evolvability towards new substrate specificities changed along these neutral lineages, dissecting the different determinants of immediate and long-term evolvability. Results demonstrate the utility of evolutionary understanding to protease engineering.&#13; Together, these experiments forward our understanding of the molecular details of both fundamental evolution and enzyme engineering. </description> <dc:date>2014-02-04T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
