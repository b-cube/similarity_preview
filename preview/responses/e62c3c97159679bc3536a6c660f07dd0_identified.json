This poll oversampled Black respondents, providing an insight into the demographic characteristics and political perspectives of Blacks or African-Americans. Respondents were asked a series of questions about perceptions of racial relations, attitudes about integration of neighborhoods, the workplace, and schools, experiences with racial discrimination, knowledge of Black history, and the relevance and importance of engaging in race relations dialogues. Respondents were asked to compare the opportunities available to their generation to the opportunities of past and future generations and what was the most important problem for the next generation to solve. In addition, respondents were asked for their views on issues such as racial profiling, interracial relationships, community/law enforcement relationships, and the representation of Blacks in professional and leadership positions. Demographic information includes age, employment status, sex, race, education, household income, religious preference, voter registration and participation history, political party, political orientation, ethnicity, marital status, type of residential area, and whether respondents had any school-age children in the household.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"2000-06\" cycle=\"P1\">2000-06</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2000-06-21\" cycle=\"P1\">2000-06-21</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2000-06-29\" cycle=\"P1\">2000-06-29</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Adult population of the United States aged 18 and over having telephones at home.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    An oversample of Black respondents was conducted for this poll, for a total of 1075 interviews among this group. A variation of random-digit dialing using primary sampling units (PSUs) was employed, consisting of blocks of 100 telephone numbers identical through the eighth digit and stratified by geographic region, area code, and size of place. Within households, respondents were selected using a method developed by Leslie Kish and modified by Charles Backstrom and Gerald Hursh (see Backstrom and Hursh, SURVEY RESEARCH. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1963).          </sampProc>                                                  <collMode>telephone interview</collMode>                   <weight>               The variables WGHT (Final Weight) and WGT3 (Original Weight) are to be used in analyses.
