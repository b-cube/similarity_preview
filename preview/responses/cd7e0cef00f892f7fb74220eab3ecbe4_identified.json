The dataset runs from the breeding season in 1993 to the end of the breeding season in 2014. The first egg dates are presented as the number days from the start date which was set as the 1st April each year. Because the breeding of greats tits and blue tits is influenced in large part by ambient temperature and the phenology of their main prey, the data were collected as a measure spring phenology. These data comprise part of a larger long-term study of the influence of habitat (extent, structure and composition) and landscape factors on abundance, distribution and breeding success of woodland birds in English lowland deciduous woodland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cambridgeshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monks Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brampton Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wennington Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>blue tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Parus major</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cyanistes caeruleus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>breeding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deciduous woodland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable land management (en)</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-10T12:37:18Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/cca47088-8cdd-4d7a-86b4-90f0a1766364\">     <title>Integrated Hydrological Units of the United Kingdom View Service</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/cca47088-8cdd-4d7a-86b4-90f0a1766364</link>     <description>The Integrated Hydrological Units (IHU) of the United Kingdom (UK) define geographical reference units for hydrological purposes including river flow measurement and hydrometric data collection in the UK. The datasets in this series represent the following component polygon layers: Hydrometric Areas with Coastline, Hydrometric Areas without Coastline, Groups, Sections, and Catchments. Each layer represents a different level of spatial detail. The coarsest level, Hydrometric Areas, is provided in two versions to meet differing user needs. Each Hydrometric Area is made up of one or more Groups. Each Group carries a name constructed from names of the major river flowing through the Group, the major river flowing into the Group, the major river into which the Group flows, and in some cases also from local county names. Each Group is made up of smaller units called Sections. A Section is the drainage area of a watercourse between two confluences. Only confluences of named watercourses were considered. Similarly to Groups, each Section carries a name constructed from names of the major river flowing through the Section, the major river flowing into the Section, and the major river into which the Section flows. Catchments represent the full area upstream from an outlet of every Section. Polygons within each layer do not have gaps and, with the exception of Catchments, polygons within one layer do not overlap. Identifiers and attributes have been calculated so that direct upstream and direct downstream units within the same layer and also related units across layers can be easily selected. The Hydrometric Areas with Coastline layer covers Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but all other layers currently cover Great Britain only as no dataset with river geometries and names with suitable detail is available for Northern Ireland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>watershed</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>section</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>group</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometric area</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-05T15:15:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/10d419c8-8f65-4b85-a78a-3d6e0485fa1f\">     <title>Integrated Hydrological Units of the United Kingdom: Catchments</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/10d419c8-8f65-4b85-a78a-3d6e0485fa1f</link>     <description>This dataset is part of Integrated Hydrological Units (IHU) of the UK, a set of geographical reference units for hydrological purposes including river flow measurement and hydrometric data collection.

On the majority of these sites, recorders walk a fixed route (divided into up to 15 sections) at their site every week from 1st April to 29th September (total of 26 weeks), each year, counting butterflies within defined limits (5m box) when weather meets certain criteria. On some sites different survey techniques are employed to assess the abundance of species. These techniques include timed counts and larval web surveys in fixed areas. Weather data is recorded at the time of the count and habitat data is available for most transects. The surveys are undertaken by volunteers and other recorders, who contribute their data free of charge. The scheme is operated as a partnership between the Centre For Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC), and is jointly sponsored by a multi-agency consortium of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Natural Environment Research Council (through CEH), BC, Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Countryside Council for Wales, Natural England, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage. UKBMS data is widely used for research; a list of publications as well as downloadable PDF copies of past Annual Reports is made available via the UKBMS website. Datasets currently available for download are yearly calculations of species trends and collated indices of abundance, as well as yearly updated site data. Access to the full dataset should be requested directly from the UKBMS.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-06T09:13:09Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d</link>     <description>Collated indices are a relative measure of butterfly abundance across monitored sites in the UK, calculated from data collected by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Collated indices are calculated annually for each individual butterfly species that has been recorded on five or more sites in that year. Based on this criterion collated indices have been calculated for the entire UKBMS time series from 1976 to the current year for the majority of species. For some rarer species the time series starts in a later year due to lack of data. Collated indices are calculated using a statistical model that accounts for missing data. The number of sites for each species ranges from 5 to several hundred and varies from year to year. Since 2008 more than 1,000 sites have been monitored across the UK each year. Collated indices are calculated so that we can determine how butterfly populations are changing over time across the UK. This data can be used, for example, to determine where to target conservation efforts and to measure the condition of the UK countryside. Butterflies are recognised as important indicators of biodiversity and environmental change (e.g. as official UK Biodiversity Indicators), and have been used in numerous research studies to understand the impacts of changes in climate and the extent and condition of habitats. Although the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of the Collated indices, the collection of the data used in their creation is ultimately reliant on a large volunteer community. The UKBMS is funded by a consortium of organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-10-27T14:27:51Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/15b65cf5-d54a-43ff-9cd9-7483bea36ab3\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: species trends 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/15b65cf5-d54a-43ff-9cd9-7483bea36ab3</link>     <description>This dataset provides linear trends, over varying time periods, for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) Collated Indices of individual butterfly species across the UK. The main statistical values derived from a linear regression (slope, standard error, P-value) are presented for the entire time series for each species (1976 to 2013), for the last 20 years, and for the last decade. In addition a trend class, based on slope direction and its significance, and a percentage change for that time period are provided to describe the statistical trends. These trend data are provided for 59 UK butterfly species. Trends across different time series allow us to determine the long and short-term trends for individual species. This is enables us to focus conservation and research and also to assess species responses to conservation already in place. The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of this trend datasets.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 591 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths for 7 different feature categories within 45 different Land Class categories, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-24T09:35:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/73a7ae36-2882-434f-a206-76b848e22d82\">     <title>Total alkalinity data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/73a7ae36-2882-434f-a206-76b848e22d82</link>     <description>Discrete total alkalinity data for 13 sites in the Humber catchment sampled within the period 1993 to 1997 and 1996 to 1997 and for 3 sites from the Tweed catchment over the period 1994 to 1997, as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS).

The measurements were taken weekly during November 2009, once in March 2010 and once in May 2011, with the aim to quantify pharmaceutical usage during the influenza pandemic of 2009 and how this compares to inter-pandemic drug use. River samples were acquired by grab samples in glass jars and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS). Two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in southern England (Benson and Oxford) were also sampled during the peak of the second wave of the 2009 influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 pandemic (10-11 November 2009) and on 15 May 2011 using an automated sampler set to acquired hourly (time proportional) samples from the influent and effluent of the WWTPs. The WWTPs are the source for all the drugs found in the river, hence, these were studied to understand the differential fate of the analytes in the two very different WWTPs. Flows for the WWTP and River sampling locations are presented for each of the sampling times to allow for determining hourly loads for the WWTP and daily loads for the river.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pandemic</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>influenza</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>antibiotic</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>antiviral</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>decongestant</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wastewater treatment plant</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>River Thames</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wastewater epidemiology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Thames Catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Benson Sewage Works</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oxford Sewage Works</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-01T14:21:43Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
