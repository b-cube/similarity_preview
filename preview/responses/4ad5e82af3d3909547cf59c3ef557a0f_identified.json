Chum salmon spawners returning to Fish Creek, southeastern Alaska, were sampled yearly from 1972 through 1996. Spawners retuning to the Quilcene National Fish Hatchery in Hood Canal, Washington, were sampled yearly from 1973 through 1996. Size at maturity of both populations declined significantly from about 1980 to the mid-1990s. Age at maturity increased during this time. These changes were associated with a major ocean climate regime shift in the North Pacific Ocean that occurred in 1976-77. Population abundance of chum salmon increased greatly after the regime shift, especially in Asia. Similar changes in size and age at maturity occurred in Asian chum salmon; because the range of North American and Asian chum salmon overlaps on the high seas, these changes are discussed in relation to possible density-dependent population factors. Since the mid-1990s, size at maturity and population abundance have increased, possibly indicating another climate change in the North Pacific Ocean.</dcterms:abstract>    <dc:publisher>Alaska Fisheries Science Center</dc:publisher>    <dc:creator>Martinson, Ellen </dc:creator>    <dc:creator>Alaska Fisheries Science Center</dc:creator>    <dc:identifier xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/17278</dc:identifier>    <dcterms:isPartOf xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/12324</dcterms:isPartOf>    <dcterms:spatial xsi:type=\"dcterms:Box\">                         northlimit=60.80222;                         eastlimit=-122.8626639;                         southlimit=47.8187027;                         westlimit=-146.127222;                                              name=Fish Creek near Hyder, Alaska, Quilcene River near Quilcene Washington, Chilkat River near Haines Alaska, Olsen Creek near cordova Alaska.;                     </dcterms:spatial>    <dcterms:temporal xsi:type=\"dcterms:Period\">                             start=1959;                             end=2009;                         </dcterms:temporal>    <dcterms:accessRights>The data set is still being analyzed and will not be available for distribution until it has been finalized and all QA/QC practices have been performed.
