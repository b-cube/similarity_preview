Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.  In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.  In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. </abstract> <purpose>This sonar mosaic was generated from Klein 3000 sidescan-sonar data  collected by the U.S. Geological Survey during  USGS field activity 2005-004-FA within Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. These data are used to define the lake floor sediment distribution within Moultonborough Bay.  The sonar data will be correlated to sediment samples, bottom video and photographs  collected in the bay in order to interpret the acoustic facies.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20050726</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-71.395192</westbc> <eastbc>-71.353088</eastbc> <northbc>43.731992</northbc> <southbc>43.701454</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>General</themekt> <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey> <themekey>USGS</themekey> <themekey>Coastal and Marine Geology Program</themekey> <themekey>CMGP</themekey> <themekey>Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center</themekey> <themekey>WHCMSC</themekey> <themekey>Marine Geology</themekey> <themekey>field activity number 2005-004-FA</themekey> <themekey>USGS CMGP InfoBank ID R-1-05-NH</themekey> <themekey>sidescan</themekey> <themekey>sidescan-sonar</themekey> <themekey>sonar</themekey> <themekey>backscatter</themekey> <themekey>GeoTIFF Image</themekey> <themekey>gray scale</themekey> <themekey>mosaic</themekey> <themekey>Klein</themekey> <themekey>Klein 3000</themekey> <themekey>k3k</themekey> <themekey>R/V Rafael</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey> <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>General</placekt> <placekey>North America</placekey> <placekey>United States</placekey> <placekey>New Hampshire</placekey> <placekey>Lake Winnipesaukee</placekey> <placekey>Moultonborough Bay</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>none</accconst> <useconst>Public domain data from the U.S. Government are freely redistributable with proper metadata and source attribution.

Gaps generally occur in nearshore areas too shallow to successfully maneuver the R/V Rafael.</logic> <complete>Lines 43 - 112 were used to generate the final GeoTIFF mosaic. Gaps present in this data are generally in shallow-water areas where the system was not tracking bottom, or poor quality sonar returns precluded use in the completed mosaic.  Additionally, some lines were very noisy (e.g. l110f1) and were not included in the final mosaic.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>Navigation was acquired with Wide Area Augmentation System ( WAAS), which is accurate to + or - 1 to 2 meters, horizontally.  Navigation data were acquired with a LGBX Pro receiver and sent directly to the sidescan-sonar acquisition software, L3-Klein Associates, SonarPro. The LGBX Pro received WAAS positions from an antenna located on the port, aft roof of the cabin. The sidescan-sonar towfish was towed at a shallow depth, close to the lake surface due to the shallow waters of the survey area. Layback was measured upon deployment of the towfish. During data processing, layback was found to be negligible due to the shallow-tow of the vehicle. No significant offset of features was observed when mosaicking adjacent lines of sonar data. The following offsets are measured prior to deployment of the sidescan-sonar towfish and entered into SonarPro: height of the block, offset from DGPS (WAAS) antenna to the block, and height of the DGPS antenna above the waterline.  Considering errors in measuring towfish layback, as well as accuracy of WAAS, horizontal accuracy of the sidescan-sonar data are conservatively assumed to be + or - 10 meters.</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin> <pubdate>Unpublished Material</pubdate> <title>raw backscatter data</title> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>disc</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20050726</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition of field activity</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>none</srccitea> <srccontr>Data were acquired with an L3-Klein Associates 3000 digital, dual-frequency, sidescan-sonar (www.l-3klein.com). Dual frequencies are nominally 100 (132 kHz) and 500 (445 kHz) kHz. The sidescan-sonar was towed aft the R/V Rafael.  Line spacing was 50-meters throughout the survey area. Data files were recorded with SonarPro (2005) in XTF (extended-Triton Format) format at a 0.03-sec ping rate yielding a 50-meter range (100-meter swath). The 100 kHz data were used to generate the sidescan-sonar mosaic. The data range within the sidescan-sonar mosaic (digital number values (DN) of the 8-bit image) is 0 - 254, with the background value (i.e. No DATA) set to 255.</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> XSonar/ShowImage sidescan-sonar processing software was used to process the raw XTF sonar data following the methodology of Danforth, (1997). A 4 across track x 3 along track pixel median filter was applied to the raw sidescan-sonar data to remove speckle noise and a normalization of 4095 was applied to adjust the dynamic range within the output processed file. Processed data are stored as 8-bit. Navigation were also extracted from the raw data at  2-minute intervals and saved in an ASCII file. Quality checks were conducted on the navigation to eliminate spurious or duplicate navigation fixes. The sonar data were further processed to correct for towfish altitude (i.e. proper tracking of the lakefloor), and slant-range and beam pattern distortions inherent in the sonar data. Processed sonar files were then merged with the edited navigation. Processed sonar files were then mapped at a 1-meter resolution in UTM coordinates (UTM, Zone 19N, WGS 84, meters) and saved in two XSonar/ShowImage mosaic files representing odd and even (i.e. every other line) sonar tracklines, or files.  Below are the typical parameters for processing with XSonar: File Type: XTF, Low Frequency (132 kHz)  Setup Option: Navigation= Lat/Lon, Navigation Interval= 2 minute  Demultiplexing Range and Filter options: Across track=4 (pixels),  Along track= 3 (pixels),  Port/Starboard Normalize = 4095 (default), Port High Pass: 65535 (default,) Input= 16 bit, Normalize Image= yes.  Beam Pattern Correction options: Number of lines= 100, Ping overlap=50, Max beam angle= 90 (default), Response angle=55 (default), Data normalization (0-255)=1 (default), Port/Stbd Tone Adjustment= &quot;on&quot; and &quot;Normal&quot;  Jane F.
