These data will compose a complete, national-scale geochemical coverage of the US, and will enable construction of geochemical maps, refine estimates of baseline concentrations of chemical elements in the sampled media, and provide context for a wide variety of studies in the geological and environmental sciences.  The goal of the NGS is to analyze at least one stream-sediment sample in every 289 km2 area by a single set of analytical methods across the entire nation, with other solid sample media substituted where necessary. The NGS incorporates geochemical data from a variety of sources, including existing analyses in USGS databases, reanalyses of samples in USGS archives, and analyses of newly collected samples.  At the present time, the NGS includes data covering ~71% of the land area of the US, including samples in all 50 states. This version of the online report provides complete access to NGS data, describes the history of the project, the methodology used, and presents preliminary geochemical maps for all analyzed elements. Future editions of this and other related reports will include the results of analysis of variance studies, as well as interpretive products related to the NGS data. This database provides in digital form many geochemical analyses reported by USGS in its published literature.</abstract><purpose>These data will compose a complete, national-scale geochemical coverage of the US, and will enable construction of geochemical maps, refine estimates of baseline concentrations of chemical elements in the sampled media, and provide context for a wide variety of studies in the geological and environmental sciences.

Samples can easily be contaminated with Hg during handling, storage, and preparation for analysis. Mercury can also be lost from samples during the drying process or while in storage. Recently collected samples were handled and stored in a manner that should result in few such problems. However, many Hg data in the NGS are based on reanalyses of archival samples, e.g., NURE samples, that were neither collected using protocols appropriate for Hg analysis, nor stored under conditions that would necessarily preserve the original Hg concentrations. Some NURE samples in the eastern US were very likely contaminated by Hg at some point after collection (e.g., all samples from Allegany County, Maryland). At the present time, it is not known which archival samples may have been contaminated with Hg in the laboratory, and thus extreme caution should be exercised in interpreting NGS data.</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>Jeffrey N Grossman</cntper><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, ER</cntorg></cntperp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>Mail Stop 954 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive</address><city>Reston</city><state>VA</state><postal>20192</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>703-648-6184</cntvoice><cntfax>703-648-6383</cntfax><cntemail>jgrossman@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac><browse><browsen>http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geochem/doc/statusmaps/sample-types-09-08.jpg</browsen><browsed>The area of the United States currently covered by the NGS and for which data are available in this report.

Sample density is not uniform across the nation due to the incorporation of many different types of studies into the NGS, although a minimum density of ~1 sample per 289 km2 (dark blue) is maintained in all sampled areas (gray areas on the map, with lower densities, are not yet complete).  969x534 pixels, 243k bytes.</browsed><browset>JPEG</browset></browse><browse><browsen>http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geochem/doc/statusmaps/ngs-status-09-08.jpg</browsen><browsed>Plans for completing the NGS in the year 2008 For planning purposes, the nation was divided into ~33,000 cells, each with ~289 sq km area.

These sources can be placed in 5 broad categories based on who collected and analyzed the samples. The CATEGORY field of the database is used to store this information. Within each category, records can be broken down into a large number of datasets, each of which contains data on samples collected and analyzed together. The DATASET field of the database stores this information. Descriptions of Datasets and Categories in the NGS: http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geochem/doc/groups-cats.htm A limited number of analytical methods were used for samples in the NGS in order to provide the maximum level of internal consistency possible to the database. For every analytical data field in the NGS, there is an associated field pointing to information about the method used to make the analyses. These fields contain \"job numbers,\" which are names laboratories assigned to batches of samples that were all run together. Multi-element methods (all ICP and neutron activation methods, XRF, PGE analysis, and forms-of-carbon) each have a single field containing job information that is applicable to all analyzed elements. Single-element methods (As, Au, Hg, Sb, Se, Te, Tl, and W) each have their own field containing this information. Analytical Methods and Database Fields in the NGS: http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geochem/doc/analysis.htm</logic><complete>At the present time, the NGS includes data covering about 71% of the land area of the US, including samples in all 50 states. Four of the analytical methods are considered to be most important for general coverage of the subject: the ICP 40-element acid dissolution group, and determination of Arsenic, Mercury, and Selenium by hydride-generation atomic absorption.  Data from other analytical methods are provided when available but it was not the principal goal of the study to ensure that these analyses were completed on most samples.  Only about 5% of the samples lack data from the ICP 40-element methods, and 25% to 35% of samples lack data from the primary AA methods (for As, Hg, and Se).

Some general statements can be made, however. NGS Samples: For samples collected by the NGS (SW-ALASKA and State datasets) all coordinates were measured by handheld global positioning systems (GPS). Data were recorded in a variety of formats (decimal degrees, degrees plus decimal minutes, degrees-minutes-seconds, and UTM coordinates), and all were translated into decimal degrees. NURE samples: The coordinates of NURE samples (in all NURE datasets) , measured in the pre-GPS era, were digitized from field maps; a discussion of these methods and what datum was used may be found here. Other samples: The coordinates of all other samples (PLUTO and RASS datasets) were determined by unknown methods, unless specifically discussed in any primary publications on these datasets. Because most were collected in the pre-GPS era, most were probably digitized or otherwise read from field maps used during collection. It is likely that the NAD27 datum and Clarke 1866 ellipsoid were used on most such maps, but this is not known with confidence.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Smith, Steven M.</origin><pubdate>1997</pubdate><title>Reformatted data from the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) Hydrogeochemical and Stream Sediment Reconnaissance (HSSR) Program</title><serinfo><sername>U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report</sername><issue>97-492</issue></serinfo><onlink>http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-0492/</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>digital data</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>1975</begdate><enddate>1980</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><srccurr>Sample collection period</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>NURE-HSSR</srccitea><srccontr>Samples collected between 1975 and 1980 as part of the National Uranium Resource Evaluation (NURE) program.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Goldhaber, Martin B.</origin><origin>Irwin, Elise</origin><origin>Atkins, Brian</origin><origin>Lee, Lopaka</origin><origin>Black, Dee Dee</origin><origin>Zappia, Humbert</origin><origin>Hatch, Joe</origin><origin>Pashin, Jack</origin><origin>Barwick, Larry H.</origin><origin>Cartwright, Walter E.</origin><origin>Sanzolone, Rick</origin><origin>Ruppert, Leslie</origin><origin>Kolker, Allan</origin><origin>Finkelman, Robert</origin><pubdate>2001</pubdate><title>Arsenic in Stream Sediments of Northern Alabama</title><serinfo><sername>U.S. Geological Survey Miscellaneous Field Studies Map</sername><issue>MF-2357</issue></serinfo><onlink>http://pubs.usgs.gov/mf/2001/mf-2357/</onlink></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>digital data</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1998</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>Reanalysis of samples</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>Goldhaber and others (2001)</srccitea><srccontr>Data identified in the database where DATASET='NURE Alabama II' A suite of 1690 samples from northern Alabama (excluding the northeast corner), was pulled from the NURE archive and analyzed in 1998 for a project by M.

In addition, several quadrangles in north-central Alaska (Survey Pass, Wiseman, and Chandalar) were included in order to duplicate areas covered by the NURE program.</srccontr></srcinfo><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Thompson D.E.</origin><origin>Grosz A.E.</origin><origin>McNeal J.M.</origin><origin>Grossman J.N.</origin><pubdate>1998</pubdate><title>Surface geochemistry of Mississippi to be surveyed</title><serinfo><sername>Mississippi Geology</sername><issue>v. 19, no. 2</issue></serinfo></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>digital data</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>1998</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>Sample collection year</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>Thompson and others (1998)</srccitea><srccontr>A suite of 1421 stream sediments and soils was collected as part of a joint USGS-Mississippi Geological Survey project (Thompson and others, 1998, 2002).

Groups of samples collected by the same agency or research program are referred to in the documentation as separate \"datasets\", meaning the samples will have a common value for the fields CATEGORY and DATASET.  The CATEGORY field indicates the general type of research program collecting the samples, while the DATASET field identifies the specific project, state government, or investigator in whose effort the samples were collected.  These are described more fully in http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geochem/doc/groups-cats.htm</procdesc><procdate>1967 - 2002</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>National Geochemical Survey project By 1998-1999, it had become clear within the USGS Mineral Resources Prgram that there would be great benefits to combining earlier efforts in the southeastern states with other regional geochemical assessments being conducted by the program in the western US, and expanding to a national scale.  A new national effort comprising four interlinked regional \"Surveys and Analysis\" projects was begun, including a task to undertake a National Geochemical Survey (NGS). A complete national geochemical coverage was sought, using an internally consistent set of analytical methods and principally based on stream sediments.  The minimum sample density was planned to be 1 sample per 289 km2 in all land areas of the country (i. e., based on a 17x17 km sampling grid). Analytical methods were chosen to include a 40-element ICP package plus single-element determinations of As, Se, and Hg by atomic absorption for every sample.</procdesc><procdate>1999</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Field parties from 7 states collected samples in 2001-2003, and all were analyzed together, in random order, in 2004-2005.
