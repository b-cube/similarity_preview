Seventy-seven basement domains are represented as eighty-three polygons on the map. The domains are based on interpretations of basement composition, origin, and architecture and developed from a variety of sources. Analysis of previously published basement, lithotectonic, and terrane maps as well as models of planetary development were used to formulate the concept of basement and the methodology of defining domains that spanned the ages of Archean to the present but formed through different processes. The preliminary compilations for the study areas utilized these maps, national-scale gravity and aeromagnetic data, published and limited new age and isotopic data, limited new field investigations, and conventional geologic maps. Citation of the relevant source data for compilations and the source and types of original interpretation, as derived from different types of data, are provided in supporting descriptive text and tables. The tectonic settings for crustal types represented in the basement domains are subdivided into constituent geologic environments and the types of primary metals endowments and deposits in them are documented. The compositions, architecture, and original metals endowments are potentially important to assessments of primary mineral deposits and to the residence and recycling of metals in the crust of the United States portion of the North American continent. The databases can be configured to demonstrate the construction of the United States through time, to identify specific types of crust, or to identify domains potentially containing metal endowments of specific genetic types or endowed with specific metals. The databases can also be configured to illustrate other purposes chosen by users.</abstract><purpose>This map of basement domains of the conterminous U.S. and Alaska is intended for use as a base layer for national-scale mineral resource assessments. The compositions, architecture, and original metals endowments are potentially important to assessments of primary mineral deposits and to the residence and recycling of metals in the crust of the U.S. parts of the North American continent. The database can be used to demonstrate the construction of the U.S. through time, to identify specific types of crust, and to identify domains potentially containing metal endowments of specific genetic types or endowed with specific metals.</purpose><supplinf>Datasets in this geospatial database include \"Bsmnt_CONUS_AK\", the polygon feature class of basement domains, and \"tbl2_Environs_Deposits\", tabular data for additional geologic and deposit  information.
