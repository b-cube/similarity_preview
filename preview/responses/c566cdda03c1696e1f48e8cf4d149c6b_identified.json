Much archaeological pitchstone from the Scottish mainland is recovered from unsealed contexts of multi-period or palimpsest sites, and pitchstone artefacts from radiocarbon-dated pits therefore provide important dating evidence for this material group and its associated exchange network. In Scotland, all archaeological pitchstone derives from outcrops on the Isle of Arran, in the Firth of Clyde, and on the source island pitchstone-bearing assemblages include diagnostic types from the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Early Bronze Age period. Off Arran, pitchstone-bearing assemblages never include Mesolithic types, such as microliths, suggesting a post Mesolithic date. This suggestion is supported by worked pitchstone from radiocarbon-dated pits, where all presently available dates indicate that, on the Scottish mainland, Arran pitchstone was traded and used after the Mesolithic period, and in particular during the Early Neolithic period.</description>            <dc:creator>Torben Bjarke Ballin</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-15</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-15</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>2</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1171\">        <title>Lithic raw material procurement for projectiles points in the prehistory of Uruguay</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1171</link>            <description>&lt;p class=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;This paper focuses on current research on early colonisation of the Atlantic coast of South America during the early Holocene. We present advances in the investigation of raw material procurement at the &lt;em&gt;Rinc\\ufffd\\ufffdn de los Indios&lt;/em&gt; site, located in the eastern part of Uruguay. The technological studies suggest that some aspects of different styles of projectile points are related with environmental adaptation processes, experienced by the first American people in the New World. The occupation of new spaces and new forms of exploitation of resources changes the organisation of lithic technology. The distance to good quality rocks were critical for the opportunities and economic organisation of hunting groups. The study of changes in lithic procurement strategies for projectile points helps us develop a more comprehensive knowledge of this important social adaptation process which occurred during this period. These patterns started to become stabilised in the latter part of the early Holocene across the extended territory and confirm the efficient land occupation associated an intensive hunter-gatherer economies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Jos\\ufffd\\ufffd Mar\\ufffd\\ufffda L\\ufffd\\ufffdpez Mazz</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>\\ufffd\\ufffdscar Marozzi</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Diego Aguirrez\\ufffd\\ufffdbal</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-15</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-15</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>2</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1139\">        <title>Indexing Flakes According to their Mode of Creation</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1139</link>            <description>&lt;p class=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;The major dimensions of a flake are shown to accurately capture how a knapper&#039;s actions manage the impact dynamics responsible for flake formation. When weight and density are also known, those same dimensions convey essential information about the volumetric geometry of a flake, including basic flake shapes typically valued for tools or to control core morphology. Combining the complementary modes of information allows the culturally imbedded heritage of a removed flake to be sufficiently represented that lithic analysts can reliably evaluate the mechanisms of flake formation without needing to be skilled flintknappers themselves. Presuming that habits of making flakes are culturally determined, it should be feasible to distinguish signature traits between lithic traditions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Robert Patten</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-15</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-15</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>2</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1128\">        <title>Book review: The Emergence of Pressure Blade Making (Pierre M.

Although the papers are regionally specific, the examples and methods used provide ample reason for lithic analysts and interested archaeologists in any region to acquire a copy. The text is organized into thirteen chapters on topics of the individual author\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds choosing with the caveat that all papers relate to lithic research and analysis in the greater southeastern United States. The editors placed no theoretical or methodological constraints upon the contributors. Each paper follows an organization of technology approach in method and interpretation.</description>            <dc:creator>John Edward Dockall</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-15</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-15</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>2</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1163\">        <title>Book review: From the Yenisei to the Yukon: Interpreting Lithic Assemblage Variability in Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Beringia</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lithicstudies/article/view/1163</link>            <description>&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Yenisei to the Yukon: Interpreting Lithic Assemblage Variability in Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Beringia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;Edited by Ted Goebel and Ian Buvit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;noindent&quot;&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University Press, 2011, pp. 394.
