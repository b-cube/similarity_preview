Articles or graphics on the front and/or editorial pages of newspapers  appearing on ten sampled dates before and immediately after the  November 1974 congressional election were coded for this study. There  are 8,768 cases of front page data and 9,504 cases of editorial page  data. Each case is coded with a unit of analysis that could be any  combination of story text, headline, sub-headline, label, photograph,  and drawing or cartoon. Information collected about each case includes  specific newspaper, date, page, type of story or photo, and source of  item. In terms of content, both a first and a second problem are  identified (specific problems are classified in several major  categories, e.g., social welfare, agricultural, natural resources,  labor union/management, racial, public order, economic and business,  consumer protection, foreign affairs, national defense, government  function, and Watergate) along with corresponding descriptive  information in both their first and second mentions. Examples of such  content description are level of problem (e.g., international with no  United States connection explicit, international with United States  connection explicit, national, state, and local), person or actor  dimension (e.g., President Ford, specific political parties,  Democratic and Republican Senate candidates, specific areas of  government, specific government agencies and groups, and voters or  taxpayers in general), position of person or actor, agreement or  disagreement between persons or actors, the first and second mention  of criticism or praise dimension, and object of criticism or  praise. Additional data collected for this content analysis include  keywords (referring to a major news event), proposal method  (references to any proposed or enacted method, program, or policy to  deal with governmental, political, or social problems in the United  States), editorial endorsement of a candidate by the newspaper (coded  in categories such as experience, leadership ability, personal  qualities, party connection, government management, government  philosophy, and domestic and foreign policies), references to  Democratic and Republican senatorial races, and references to these  specific events: the textbook struggle in West Virginia, busing in  Boston, cattle killing, Nixon's resignation, Nixon's pardon, Nixon's  illness, the mastectomies, Watergate trial, Kissinger's Moscow trip,  United Nations World Food Conference, Arab and PLO summit conference, Rockefeller nomination, coal strike, and Patty Hearst.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1974\" cycle=\"P1\">1974</timePrd>                                         <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>The front page and editorial page contents of 96 daily  newspapers published in the United States on October 16, 17, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, and November 1, 3, 4, 1974.</universe>                      <dataKind>event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A network of correspondents in the primary sampling units  (PSUs) of the 1974 election study collected 160 newspapers appearing  on 16 days: October 2, 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, and  November 1, 3, 4, 6, and 10, 1974. The 16 days were selected according  to sampling procedures described in Carter, Roy E. Jr., and Robert  L. Jones. \"Some Procedures for Estimating 'News-Hole' in Content  Analysis.\" PUBLIC OPINION QUARTERLY 23 3 (1959), 399-404. Of the  newspapers collected, 96 were selected for coding, based on  availability and readership by at least seven of the  nationally-sampled respondents interviewed in the 1974 election  study. Because insufficient funds were available, only 10 of the 16 days were eventually coded for this study (Saturdays were excluded).          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          Associated Press (AP), United Press International  (UPI), New York Times Wire Service, Chicago Daily News Service, Los  Angeles Times/Washington Post Service, Foreign News Service, other  news services, and letters to the editor in any of 96 United States daily newspapers             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to   these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><list type=\"bulleted\">  <itm>Performed consistency checks.</itm><itm>Standardized missing values.</itm><itm>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</itm>  </list>  </cleanOps>              </dataColl>       <notes>                 (1) The file consists of two components: front page  data (appearing first), and editorial page data (appearing  thereafter). Front page data are indicated by unique case  identification code values below 10,000. Editorial page data are  indicated by unique case identification code values over  10,000. Within each component of the file, the cases appear in  ascending order, sorted by newspaper identification code, date, and  unit of analysis number. (2) Each newspaper's unique identification  code enables a user to merge the data in this study with that of  AMERICAN NATIONAL ELECTION STUDY, 1974 (ICPSR 7355). (3) The  frequencies used in the text of the codebook were taken from the front  page data. The frequencies addenda contain additional frequencies from  the front page data portion, as well as frequencies for the editorial page data.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR07586.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
