The survey data is a major resource for research into the nature and functioning of the innovation system and for policy formation. It is used widely across government, regions and by the research community. The UKIS also represents the UK's contribution to the Europe-wide &lt;i&gt;Community Innovation Survey&lt;/i&gt; (CIS). Like many innovation surveys across Europe, the UKIS follows general guidelines set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publication known as the Oslo Manual (OECD 2005). This manual provides guidelines on the conduct of innovation surveys, including statistical procedures and a review of the range of concepts that fall together under the umbrella term \"innovation\".&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Geographical references: postcodes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; The postcodes included in the first edition of these data (i.e. data files prior to 2008-2010) are pseudo-anonymised postcodes.  The real postcodes were not available due to the potential risk of identification of the observations.  However, these replacement postcodes retain the inherent nested characteristics of real postcodes. In the dataset, the variable of the replacement postcode is 'new_PC'.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The first two editions only include the first half of an observation's anonymised (or real) postcode (sometimes referred to as the postcode district).  Researchers who are interested in analysing data by more disaggregated geographies (e.g. ward, output area) are advised that this is not possible using the first half of the postcode. Full postcodes are available from the third edition onwards.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Linking to other business studies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; These data contain Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR) reference numbers.  These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations.  Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together.  Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For the fourth edition (January 2015), data and documentation for UKIS 8 (2010-2012) were added to the study.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>&lt;B&gt;Main Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The survey is based on a core questionnaire developed by Eurostat and Member States, and covers a broad range of policy interests including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;general business information&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;innovation activity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;goods, services and process innovation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;context for innovation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;general economic information&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;The purpose of the survey is to collect information about business innovation in the UK. An enterprise is defined as being active in innovation if it has:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;introduced a new or significantly improved good, service or process&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;engaged in innovation projects that are not yet complete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;engaged in longer term innovation activities such as basic Research and Development or technology watch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;had innovation related expenditure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;formally co-operated with other enterprises or institutions on innovation&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</abstract>       <sumDscr>         <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1994-01-01T00:00:00Z\">1994</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z\">2012</timePrd>         <nation>United Kingdom</nation>         <geogUnit>Government Office Regions</geogUnit>         <geogUnit>Postcode (Unit) [anonymised]</geogUnit>         <geogUnit>Standard Statistical Regions</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>Institutions/organisations</anlyUnit>         <universe>National</universe>         <universe>UK businesses with 10 or more employees in sections B-N of the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) 2007 (prior to 2008-2010, sections C-K of SIC 2003), registered for VAT and/or PAYE in 1994-2012.</universe>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <timeMeth>Repeated cross-sectional study</timeMeth>         <timeMeth>frequency increased from every four years to every two years in 2007; panel dataset for 2004-2008</timeMeth>         <dataCollector>Office for National Statistics</dataCollector>         <dataCollector>Northern Ireland.
