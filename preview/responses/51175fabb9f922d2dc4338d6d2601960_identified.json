A longitudinal cohort study of newborn calves was conducted in western Kenya between 2007 and 2009. Calves were randomly selected from all those reported in a 2 stage clustered sampling strategy. Calves were recruited between 3 and 7 days old. A team of veterinarians and animal health assistants carried out routine 5-weekly visits, plus clinical examinations when the calves were reported ill and post-mortem visits. Blood and tissue samples were collected in association with all visits and screened using a range of laboratory based diagnostic methods for over 100 different pathogens or infectious exposures. The study followed 548 calves over the first 51 weeks of life or until death. Full details are given in Bronsvoort et al.

Keb is a dance in which people dance without drum beats. But the person who leads the song must have a strong voice, sometimes the song is led by two people. This song shows that Papwojo Youth have increased in number, and they need more dancing mates, so the composer starts the song by asking permission from the youth leader to allow him to compose this song, because he knew that the song will motivate the youth. The composer says: Papwojo Youth dance well; small girls wish to grow up fast so that they dance with Papwojo Youth. The composer says that Papwojo is a strong village; it killed a lion alone while its neighbor, Ayijdhajo, feared to fight the lion. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-23T09:45:22Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/718\"> <title>LuciaOywalAtitker_songGovernanceInSouthSudanParts1&amp;2</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/718</link> <description>LuciaOywalAtitker_songGovernanceInSouthSudanParts1&amp;2 The recordings at the center of this item are two Shilluk songs.

Speaker input variability does not explain why larger populations have simpler languages: raw data for Experiments 1 and 2. Languages spoken by more people appear to be structurally more simple, but it is not clear why this would be the case. This study investigates one possible explanation. It has been proposed that learning in a larger community results in a learner receiving their input from a greater number of speakers. This will increase the variability of the input, and we test the proposal that this in turn may make more complex grammatical features more difficult to transfer from generation to generation. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-09T15:03:57Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/712\"> <title>Modulation of Genetic Associations with Serum Urate Levels by Body-Mass-Index in Humans</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/712</link> <description>Modulation of Genetic Associations with Serum Urate Levels by Body-Mass-Index in Humans </description> <dc:date>2015-02-04T16:58:54Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/711\"> <title>ARCHER CSE Performance Data and Service Report: Q4 2014</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/711</link> <description>ARCHER CSE Performance Data and Service Report: Q4 2014 Data from SAFE (https://www.archer.ac.uk/safe) and Quarter 4 2014 Service Report from ARCHER Computational Science and Engineering Service.

Chief Awaakjok was the chief of Papwojo Village in Tonga District. Awaakjok was the chief during the first war (1955-1972), and he protected Papwojo during that war. When the second war came (1983-2005), Papwojo was burnt by the Arabs, so the composer says that if Awaakjok had been there, he would not allow this to happen. Chief Awaagjok was like a king; because Papwojo is bordering Nuba to the north, Dinka to the west and Nuer to the south; all these people come to the Shilluk land in the dry season. They take permission from the chief of Papwojo who reports to the paramount chief of Tonga, who in turn reports to the king. The Kwa-othuro clan are in-charge of the oak tree. The Shilluk make boats and drums out of that hard tree, and nobody can cut the tree without permission from the Kwa-\\ufffd\\ufffdthuro clan. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T10:39:19Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/703\"> <title>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songTheBoatOfTheArab</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/703</link> <description>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songTheBoatOfTheArab The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. A boat carrying army went from Malakal to Akorwa in Mwomo in July 1965, and took every good thing into the boat. Then the army burnt the shrine, and Akorwa Village. The boat caught fire on its way to Malakal, and sank in front of Odaango Village. So, King Kur went to Omdurman to complain to the Imam of Ansar for destroying their religious and cultural sites. Then the two leaders went to the government to complain. The government stopped forcing the people to become muslims in the south. Joseph Nyayang, the composer was in Bur Village when Nyikango\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds shrine in Akorwa was burnt. So, he was tempted to compose a song about the incident, but he resisted the idea because he is a Christian and did not want to compose songs about Nyikango. Then he became very ill and lost the taste of everything (his grain beer became dirty). He became so weak that he gave in and went to the centre of the village and started singing this song; he thought that Nyikango was angry with him because he didn't want to sing the song that came to him concerning the incident. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T10:35:27Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/702\"> <title>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songAjyangAndAkic</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/702</link> <description>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songAjyangAndAkic The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Ajyang and Akic were chiefs of Detwok. The army killed those two chiefs and burnt Detwok Village on 30 September 1964. The informants were Shilluks; they guided the Arabs and gave information about individuals or villages that have welcomed the Anya Nya. Those who took the army to Detwok were Shilluks. Each of them used to be given a sack of dura after every betrayal. They killed people, burned villages and shrines for just one sack of dura. Ajyag and Akic were not afraid to face death in defense of their village; they were like a shelter. The educated South Sudanese were targeted and killed, but all the teachers and officials who had no relations with Anya Nya, were exiled to Northern Sudan. The composer predicted that the Arabs will go and the exiled children of God will come back home; this is what happened in 1972 after the Addis Agreement. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T10:31:43Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/701\"> <title>Lagging strand replication shapes the mutational landscape of the genome</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/701</link> <description>Lagging strand replication shapes the mutational landscape of the genome The origin of mutations is central to understanding evolution and of key relevance to health. Variation occurs non-randomly across the genome, and mechanisms for this remain to be defined. Here we report that the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments have significantly increased levels of nucleotide substitution, indicating a replicative origin for such mutations. Using a novel method, emRiboSeq, we map the genome-wide contribution of polymerases, and show that despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-alpha (Pol-alpha) is retained in vivo, comprising ~1.5% of the mature genome. We propose that DNA-binding proteins that rapidly re-associate post-replication act as partial barriers to Pol-delta-mediated displacement of Pol-alpha-synthesized DNA, resulting in incorporation of such Pol-alpha tracts and increased mutation rates at specific sites. We observe a mutational cost to chromatin and regulatory protein binding, resulting in mutation hotspots at regulatory elements, with signatures of this process detectable in both yeast and humans. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-23T13:45:33Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/695\"> <title>Quasi-geostrophic double gyre force function data</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/695</link> <description>Quasi-geostrophic double gyre force function data </description> <dc:date>2015-01-22T17:09:36Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/692\"> <title>ARCHER CSE Performance Data and Service Report: Q1 2014</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/692</link> <description>ARCHER CSE Performance Data and Service Report: Q1 2014 Data from SAFE (https://www.archer.ac.uk/safe) and Quarter 1 2014 Service Report from ARCHER Computational Science and Engineering Service.

The bull's colour is like that of leopard 'kwec'. His Christian name is Mariano. All these names are mentioned in this song. He was the only teacher from Nyibodo at his time. The composer says: Now that he is dead, nobody in Nyibody will read any book/letter sent to the chief, or to anybody in the village. Abinykwec son of Ayoker was an evangelist and taught in village school. He was humble and a man of vision. The song mixes Christian and traditional beliefs, and this is very unusual; the song calls Shilluk land as: land of Nyikango and land of God Almighty. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-05T15:41:12Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/682\"> <title>AmaliaAyulDeng_songTheBuffaloOfTakamol</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/682</link> <description>AmaliaAyulDeng_songTheBuffaloOfTakamol The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Shilluk people love one another and are united wherever they are found. During the war that started in 1983, many people left their homes and went to live in northern Sudan. Women formed their social groups and each group chose a name. The women of Takamol Haj Yousif called themselves \\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffdg/Buffalo. This song was the first for the women of Takamol. It was composed for the purpose of going to beg for a cow from Otwongo Jwaj in Takamol in 1992. The women needed a bull for their first celebration. They went to Otwongo house and spent the night, singing and dancing. Yes, Otwongo Kwajyalo gave a bull. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-05T15:35:33Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/680\"> <title>Parallel simplex benchmarking results</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/680</link> <description>Parallel simplex benchmarking results Data used to generate results in \"Parallelizing the dual revised simplex method\" http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/hall/HuHa13/, a copy of which is attached. </description> <dc:date>2014-12-23T10:57:42Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/679\"> <title>PeterPaulinoTwong_songPakangMarchingSong</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/679</link> <description>PeterPaulinoTwong_songPakangMarchingSong The song at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Marching songs are about the courage and strength of a village or a group.  They are warriors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd songs that are sung when people are marching for war, or going to fight a fierce animal like a lion, elephant or leopard. People had no guns, so when an animal killed a cow, people start a war call, and everybody runs there with his shield and spears. Men from nearby villages come running. When all the people arrive, they divide themselves into smaller groups. And go to attack the animal that will be hiding in the grass. This Pakang Marching Song is about a lion that ate a cow near the village and then went away into the Forest of Abayo. Then Pakang and Obay villages decided to follow the lion. They followed its foot-prints in the ashes of the burnt grass. When they found it in Abayo Forest, the fighting began; the lion wounded many people from the two villages, but they killed it.  Pakang and its neighbour Obay, were enemies, but they went together to fight with the lion. So, the composer called the two villages \"\\ufffd\\ufffdgag\" crow that ate the lion. And nobody will separate them after that war with the lion. True, Pakang and Obay remained friends since that time; 1917 which was the first year of King Gwang in power. </description> <dc:date>2014-12-18T17:11:41Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/677\"> <title>Four cover designs for the EAR 33rd Edition 2013</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/677</link> <description>Four cover designs for the EAR 33rd Edition 2013 Cover design tests for the 33rd Edition of the Edinburgh Architecture Research journal.

Keb is a dance in which people dance without drum beats. But the person who leads the song must have a strong voice, sometimes the song is led by two people. This song is a very famous one. It is a very old song, but it remained through many age-sets and up to now, it is sung during the dances in marriages. Pak\\ufffd\\ufffdng is a big village, it is almost in the middle of Panyikango District. Pak\\ufffd\\ufffdng remained very strong through ages. So, this k\\ufffd\\ufffdb song gives a true picture of that village. </description> <dc:date>2014-12-09T10:52:56Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/675\"> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songWriting</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/675</link> <description>OttoGwadoAyoker_songWriting The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. In early 1996, the Shilluk Language Council was divided among itself over the chair, while the literacy team and the Bible Translation team were very active. I was not happy with what the elders were doing. So, I made this song and sang it first in June 1996, at the closing ceremony of 1 &amp; 2 Samuel Workshop in Omdurman. Then I sang it to the leaders at the Unity High School in Khartoum. The song was encouraging because it challenged everybody to contribute to the work being done by the people mentioned in the song. </description> <dc:date>2014-12-01T12:55:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/674\"> <title>AndrewWanhMayik_songFuneralSongForJagoAyoker</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/674</link> <description>AndrewWanhMayik_songFuneralSongForJagoAyoker The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. The composer of this funeral song of Chief Ayoker is unknown. But people think that it was composed by a relative. The composer was thinking that his relative, Chief Ayoker was bewitched by one of the families who take turn in ruling Acob Village which he calls \"Paa C\\ufffd\\ufffdll\\ufffd\\ufffd\" in the song.  Okyec son of Yor (Chief Ayoker), was highly respected. Moved by the song, Amaylek the brother of Chief Ayoker, went to King Gwang (1917-1944), asking for another chance, because his brother did not rule for a long time. The King gave his family another chance. So, Amaylek became chief in 1940, in place of his brother, Chief Ayoker. </description> <dc:date>2014-11-25T09:49:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/673\"> <title>AndrewWanhMayik_songGirlsAreTaken</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/673</link> <description>AndrewWanhMayik_songGirlsAreTaken The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Young men would seek new dancing mates if the girls with whom they dance were taken by another group. They can also seek to win girls from another village if they outnumber the girls with whom they dance. In this song, the young men from Dh\\ufffd\\ufffdgalal took the girls of the house of Amaylidh in Nyibodo from the young men of Papwojo, because they outnumbered their dancing mates. They convinced Nyacyangjwok, the leader of the girls, to reject Papwojo youth because they are fishermen. That they are like Palata and Mathany tribes that live on fish; they smell bad. </description> <dc:date>2014-11-25T09:45:56Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/672\"> <title>LLEAPP 2013 final performance recording</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/672</link> <description>LLEAPP 2013 final performance recording This is a live recording of the final performance of the LLEAPP 2013 workshop on 18th April 2013 at Inspace, Edinburgh.

However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective. </description> <dc:date>2014-11-19T10:13:27Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/670\"> <title>LLEAPP 2013 performance video 16</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/670</link> <description>LLEAPP 2013 performance video 16 This is a video recording from the performance at the end of LLEAPP 2013 workshop held from 16-19 April 2013 at the University of Edinburgh.
