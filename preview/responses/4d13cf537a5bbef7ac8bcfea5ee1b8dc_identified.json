Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the \"Geometry and Topology\" (GT) class of objects in the \"Spatial Data Transfer Standard\" (SDTS) FIPS publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: -Complete chains must begin and end at nodes; -Complete chains must connect to each other at nodes, -Complete chains do not extend through nodes; -Left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process; -The chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. Some polygons in the TIGER/Line files may be so small that the polygon internal point has been manually placed on a node that defines the polygon perimeter. These small polygons have been detected, and corrections will be incorporated in the Census TIGER data in the future.</logic>       <posacc>        <horizpa>          <horizpar>The information present in these files is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only. Coordinates in the TIGER/Line files have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest. The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used, but generally the information is no better than the established national map Accuracy standards for 1:100,000-scale maps from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); thus it is NOT suitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The USGS 1:100,000-scale maps met national map accuracy standards and use coordinates defined by the North American Datum, 1983. The cartographic fidelity of most of the 1998 TIGER/Line files, in areas outside the 1980 census Geographic Base File/Dual Independent map Encoding (GBF/DIME) file coverage and selected other large metropolitan areas, compare favorable with the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps.</horizpar>        </horizpa>      </posacc>       <lineage>        <srcinfo>          <srccite>            <citeinfo>              <origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, Geography Division</origin>               <pubdate>Unpublished material</pubdate>               <title>TIGER/Line Files, 1998</title>               <edition>1998</edition>            </citeinfo>          </srccite>           <srcscale>100000</srcscale>           <typesrc>On line</typesrc>           <srctime>            <timeinfo>              <sngdate>                <caldate>1998</caldate>              </sngdate>            </timeinfo>             <srccurr>Date the file was made available to create TIGER/Line File extracts.</srccurr>          </srctime>           <srccitea>TIGER</srccitea>           <srccontr>Selected geographic and cartographic information (line segments) from the Census TIGER data base.</srccontr>        </srcinfo>         <srcinfo>          <srccite>            <citeinfo>              <origin>U.S. Department of Commerce.

Software (TIGER DB routines) written by the Geography Division allows for efficient access to Census TIGER system data. TIGER/Line files are extracted from the Census TIGER data base by county or statistical equivalent area. Census TIGER data for a given county or statistical equivalent area is then distributed among 17 fixed length record ASCII files, each one containing attributes for either line, polygon, or landmark geographic data types. The Bureau of the Census has released various versions of the TIGER/Line files since 1988, with each version having more updates (feature and feature names, address ranges and ZIP Codes, coordinate updates, revised field definitions, etc.) than the previous version. Information concerning steps taken to create TIGER/Line is available in \"Chapter 5: Data Quality\" in TIGER/Line 1998 Technical Documentation &lt;http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu/metadata/census.jsp&gt;.</procdesc>           <srcused>Census TIGER data base</srcused>           <procdate>1999</procdate>        </procstep>         <procstep>          <procdesc>A number of TIGER/Line 98 files were converted to shapefiles using the TGR2SHP 4.1 software using a batch process. In addition, a number of the shapefiles were created from ArcEsport files. Existing ArcExport files were downloaded from CUGIR and extracted. The .e00 's were then converted to coverages with the \"ArcView Import from Interchange file\" tool within ArcToolbox. In ArcCatalog, the coverages were converted to shapefiles using the \"Export to shapefile\" command.</procdesc>           <procdate>2000</procdate>        </procstep>      </lineage>    </dataqual>     <spdoinfo>      <direct>Vector</direct>    </spdoinfo>     <spref>      <horizsys>        <geograph>          <latres>0.000458</latres>           <longres>0.000458</longres>           <geogunit>Decimal Degrees</geogunit>        </geograph>         <geodetic>          <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>           <ellips>Geodedic Reference System 80</ellips>           <semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis>           <denflat>298.257222101</denflat>        </geodetic>      </horizsys>    </spref>     <eainfo>      <overview>        <eaover>The TIGER/Line files contain data describing three major types of features/entities; Line Features: 1) Roads; 2) Railroads; 3) Hydrography; 4) Miscellaneous transportation features and Selected power lines and pipe lines; 5) Political and statistical boundaries. Landmark Features: 1) Point landmarks, e.g., schools and churches; 2) Area landmarks, e.g., Parks and cemeteries; 3) Key geographic locations (KGLs), e.g., apartment buildings and factories. Polygon features: 1) Geographic entity codes for areas used to tabulate the 1990 census statistical data and current geographic areas; 2) Locations of area landmarks 3) Locations of KGLs. The line features and polygon information form the majority of data in the TIGER/Line files. Some of the data/attributes describing the lines include coordinates, feature identifiers (names), CFCCs (used to identify the most noticeable characteristic of a feature), address ranges, and geographic entity codes. The TIGER/Line files contain point and area labels that describe landmark features and provide locational reference. Area landmarks consist of a feature name or label and feature type assigned to a polygon or group of polygons. Landmarks may overlap or refer to the same set of polygons. The Census TIGER data base uses collections of spatial objects (points, lines, and polygons) to model or describe real-world geography. The Census Bureau uses these spatial objects to represent features such as streets, rivers, and political boundaries and assigns</eaover>         <eadetcit>For Entity and Attribute information, goto \"Chapter 5\" and \"Chapter 6\" of the U.S. Bureau of the Census, TIGER/Line file 1998 Technical Documentation, which is available at: &lt;http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu/metadata/census.jsp&gt;.
