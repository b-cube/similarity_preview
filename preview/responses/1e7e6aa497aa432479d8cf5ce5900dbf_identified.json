CCR collects information on over 140,000 cancer cases annually, including demographic data, cancer type, extent of disease at diagnosis, treatment, and survival.  Cancers include all malignant neoplasms, regardless of tissue origin, including malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin Disease, and leukemia, but excluding basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical carcinoma in situ, and grade III cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.  CCR operates in support and coordination with the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCP) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute.</supplinf>  </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>200120919</caldate>  <time />  </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current>  </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress>  <update>None planned</update>  </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.5</westbc>  <eastbc>-114.1</eastbc>  <northbc>42.0</northbc>  <southbc>32.5</southbc>  </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ICD-9-CM</themekt>  <themekey>Cancer, Incidence, SEER, Epidemiology, Health, Disease, Registry, Childhood Cancers, Bladder, Brain/ Central Nervous Systems (&lt;20 years), Breast, Leukemia, Lymphoid Leukemia (&lt;20 years), Acute Myeloid leukemia, Chronic Lymphocitic Leukemia, Lung and Bronchus, Non-Hodgkin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Lymphoma, Thyroid, Brain/ Other Nervous Systems, Leukemia (&lt;20 years), Acute Lymphocitic Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (&lt;20 years), Mesothelioma, Invasive Melanoma, Liver and Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancers, Kidney and Renal Pelvis Cancers (including Wilms tumor), Larynx Cancers, Pharynx Cancers, Esophageal Cancers, Pancreatic Cancers.</themekey>  </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt>  <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey>  </place> </keywords> <accconst> </accconst>  <useconst>This information is provided by the California Environmental Health Tracking Program (CEHTP) in the California Department of Public Health and the California Cancer Registry (CCR) in the California Health and Human Services Agency.

It is believed that >95% of cases are reported to CCR within two years of diagnosis.  Veteran&apos;s Health Administration (VHA) hospitals in California stopped reporting cancer cases to the California Cancer Registry beginning in 2005, however. Although there is no way to know how many unreported cancer cases were diagnosed in these facilities since that time, historically VHA-reported cases have accounted for approximately 4 percent of all new male cancers reported to the CCR. </complete>  <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc> </procdesc>  <procdate>20120919</procdate>  </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>Rates are age-adjusted following the 19 age strata employed by the National Center for Health Statistics adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard million.
