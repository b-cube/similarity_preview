The location of the body center of mass (CM) is useful for a wide range of&#13; biomechanics analyses relevant to the design of seats, chairs, restraint systems,&#13; and other products and environments intended for human use. The body CM is usually&#13; estimated by summing the contributions of individual body segments, often using on&#13; cadaver-based estimates calculated from regression equations, using standard&#13; anthropometric variables as inputs. However, torso CM location may not be well&#13; estimated by these methods for seated postures, in which the torso is in a markedly&#13; different posture than the supine in which cadavers are segmented. For the current&#13; analysis, whole-body laser scan data were analyzed to estimate the location of the&#13; center of mass in relaxed seated postures. Scan data from 447 women and 315 men&#13; were analyzed by computing the center of volume of horizontal slices through the&#13; body from the knees through the top of the head, excluding the upper extremities.&#13; Constant density was assumed. Estimates of the mass of the legs and upper&#13; extremities were applied at the knees and elbows, respectively. The fore-aft CM&#13; location was significantly related to body weight. In the measured posture, the CM&#13; is about 220 mm forward of the back of the buttocks for adult men of median body&#13; mass (about 77 kg). The average fore-aft CM location for a person with a body mass&#13; of 140 kg (308 lb) is about 273 mm forward of the back of the buttocks, a&#13; difference of 63 mm. </description> <dc:date>2006-05-26T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/110771\"> <title>Three Challenges of Pubrarianship</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/110771</link> <description>Three Challenges of Pubrarianship Watkinson, Charles This article describes the challenges of being both a press director and a library publisher. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-15T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
