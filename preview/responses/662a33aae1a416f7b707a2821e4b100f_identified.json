The three stations included Town Creek (TC), Oyster Landing (OL), and Clambank Creek (CB).  Twenty milliliter aliquots were extracted in duplicates or triplicates from each sample using sterile techniques.  These extractions were filtered, frozen, and later analyzed on an SIA 3000 photometer to determine quantities of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP).  Increases and decreases in measured ATP indicated both seasonal and tidal changes occurring within portions of the microbial community.</abstract> <purpose>The purpose of this portion of the Long Term Ecological Research study was to form a well-defined data set of microbial data for the North Inlet Estuary and for comparative purposes to other data sets collected within the boundaries of the North Inlet LTER site.  Further, patterns and control of organic accumulation (biomass) in the water column, surface layers, and substrate were studied in relation to time or natural and induced stresses or disturbances.</purpose> <supplinf> Publications from the LTER ATP data and other related works published by the Primary Investigators: Chrzanowski, T., L.H.

Ser. 333: 217-229. Additional ATP data were generated at North Inlet as a part of an Outwelling study during the period from November 1977 to November 1979.  The data set includes ATP, ATP spline, POC, POC spline, DOC, DOC spline, fungi, fungi spline, and velocity. Additional ATP data were also generated as part of the Bly Creek study done at North Inlet during the period of June 1983 - June 1984.  The data consists of BCSYN1 - BCSYN34 (raw unedited ATP data), SYN1COR - SYN34COR (raw but corrected and edited ATP data), SYN1 - SYN34 (ATP means).  Also included in the Bly Creek data are several other related datasets:  BSCAL (marsh flume calibration, unedited ATP), VMARATP (mean ATP values from marsh flume calibration), BCSCAL2 (oyster reef calibration, unedited data), OYSREATP (mean ATP values from oyster reef calibration), BCSCAL3 (transect calibration, unedited data), TRANSATP (mean ATP values from transect calibration), VDOMECO1 (oyster dome calibration, edited data), VDOMECO2 (oyster dome calibration, edited data), WEIRATP (WEIR data), and WEIRMEAN (mean ATP values for WEIR data). The Outwelling and Bly Creek ATP data are not accessible on the Internet as of June 2003; however, digital files are available at Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences.

The site is surrounded by a Spartina marsh and drains associated uplands.  Salinity ranges from 0 to 36.  The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash and some fine sediment.  This site is considered pristine and is influenced by its close proximity to the Inlet mouth.  Clambank Creek monitoring site:  33.20'0'' Lat., 79.11'33'' Long. Oyster Landing (OL):  The Oyster Landing monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area.  Samples are collected at the end of the Oyster Landing pier.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of Crab Haul Creek in the mid-western portion of North Inlet.  The creek drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0 to 36 parts per thousand and average tidal flux is approximately 1.4 m.  The creek has an average depth of ~2 m MHW and an average width of ~150m MHW at the sample site.  The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus. Oyster Landing monitoring site (in Crab Haul Creek):  33.21'2'' Lat., 79.11'27'' Long. Town Creek (TC):  The Town Creek monitoring site is located the closest to the ocean, in the mouth of North Inlet just behind the southern tip of Debidue Island.  Salinities are dominated by the oceanic conditions.  The current velocities are the strongest here, and the bottom is comprised of course sand with some shell hash.  Town Creek monitoring site:  33.19'38'' Lat., 79.10'0'' Long. These three tidal marsh creeks reside in the North Inlet Estuary. The North Inlet Estuary lies east of the uplands of Hobcaw Barony (also known as the Belle W. Baruch Property). To the north of the Estuary is the Debordieu Colony Property. The Estuary is located in Georgetown County, South Carolina. </descgeog> <bounding> <westbc>-79.192</westbc> <eastbc>-79.167</eastbc> <northbc>33.350</northbc> <southbc> 33.327 </southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>ADENOSINE 5'-TRIPHOSPHATE</themekey> <themekey>ATP</themekey> <themekey>MARINE MICROORGANISMS</themekey> <themekey>MICROBIAL BIOMASS</themekey> <themekey>MICROBIAL POPULATION</themekey> <themekey>LUCIFERIN</themekey> <themekey>LUCIFERASE</themekey> <themekey>BACTERIA</themekey> <themekey>PHYTOPLANKTON</themekey> <themekey>COASTAL</themekey> <themekey>ESTUARINE</themekey> <themekey>ESTUARY</themekey> <themekey>LONG-TERM</themekey> <themekey>LONG-TERM ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH</themekey> <themekey>LTER</themekey> <themekey>TIDAL CREEK</themekey> <themekey>MARSH</themekey> <themekey>SALT MARSH</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>CLAMBANK CREEK</placekey> <placekey>COASTAL</placekey> <placekey>CRAB HAUL CREEK</placekey> <placekey>EAST COAST</placekey> <placekey>GEORGETOWN COUNTY</placekey> <placekey>NORTH INLET ESTUARY</placekey> <placekey>OYSTER LANDING</placekey> <placekey>SOUTH CAROLINA</placekey> <placekey>SOUTHEAST COAST</placekey> <placekey>TOWN CREEK</placekey> <placekey>USA</placekey> </place> <stratum> <stratkt>None</stratkt> <stratkey>UPPER WATER COLUMN</stratkey> </stratum> <temporal> <tempkt>None</tempkt> <tempkey>1981</tempkey> <tempkey>1982</tempkey> <tempkey>1983</tempkey> <tempkey>1984</tempkey> <tempkey>1985</tempkey> <tempkey>1981-1985</tempkey> <tempkey>1980s</tempkey> <tempkey> DAILY </tempkey> </temporal> </keywords> <accconst>None; however, it is strongly recommended that these data be acquired directly from the Belle W.

This program was run in conjunction with a full screen manager.  The raw data were entered into a file named ATPINPUT.  The file, ATPINPUT, was a series of screens preset to hold both ATP raw data and standards.  After the file ATPINPUT was completed with the entry of raw and standard data, it was then downloaded into a file named ATPRAW, for corrections.  When the quality of the data was verified, the command 'Run ATPCOR' was given.  This command took the ATPRAW file and merged it with the ATPCOR program and ran it.  The output was placed in a file named ATPCON.  This file consisted of the ATP concentrations created from ATPRAW.  The ATP concentrations are given in both grams of ATP/ml and grams of ATP/m3. Related programs include CVMEAN, SASMEAN, and MNMEAN. CVMEAN is a basic means job run on the triplicates, which lists in the output, variable, N, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, standard error of the mean, sum, variance and coefficient of the variance.  Coefficient of the variance was used to create an edited data set.  SASMEAN was a means job run on the edited data set created above.  The output from this job consisted only of the variables:  date, site, and ATP mean.  MNMEAN was a means job run on the edited data set also.  The output from this job consisted only of a year, month and ATP mean for the entire month. </tooldesc> <toolacc> <toolinst>Printed versions of programs are located in the printed 3-ring notebook at the BMFL computer laboratory.

However, ATP values in grams per milliliter and per cubic meter in the original database were listed to four decimal places multiplied by an exponent.  In the data files with calculated means, the grams ATP per cubic meter values were listed to eight decimal places.  See Entity_and_Attribute_Overview Section.  See example below: &gt; &gt;Variable  Type  Units and Range of measurement &gt;ATP (ml)  real (6.4) 0.0001-0.9999 x grams x exp &gt;ATP (m3)  real (6.4) 0.0000-0.9999 x grams x exp &gt;ATP (m3)  real (10.8) 0.00000000-0.99999999 grams Note: In 2003, the Data Rescue and Dissemination Project changed the units of measurement for the Disseminated Rescued files.  Original text files remain unchanged.  ATP data that were originally recorded as grams per milliliter or per cubic meter multiplied by an exponent were converted to nanograms per milliliter.  However, the number of decimal places was kept to four based on the original data values being four.  See Process Step for more details on this change. </attraccr> </attracc> <logic> Not applicable </logic> <complete> Missing Data: Missing data values are due to either the sample not having been collected on the day in question or a lack of necessary materials to process the sample.  Sometime in late October/November 1982 Oyster Landing and Clambank Creek were sampled on the weekends.  At Clambank Creek there were 196 days sampled in 1981, 238 days sampled in 1982, 350 days sampled in 1983, 361 days sampled in 1984, and 89 days sampled in 1985.  At Oyster Landing there were 191 days sampled in 1981, 237 days sampled in 1982, 347 days sampled in 1983, 362 days sampled in 1984, and 89 days sampled in 1985.  At Town Creek there were 280 days sampled in 1981, 310 days sampled in 1982, 342 days sampled in 1983, 350 days sampled in 1984, and 88 days sampled in 1985.  Go to Appendix A in the hardcopy version of this documentation or go to this link to view or print out the list of missing values at each site for each date:  http://links.baruch.sc.edu/data/LTERATP/metadata/LTERATP.MissingData.htm.  Missing data were denoted with a period (.) and were inserted into the Final Rescued data files. Missing \"Replicate\" Samples: Data Files LTERCO 1 - 32 contains data from samples taken at Oyster Landing, Town Creek and Clambank Creek.  The majority of samples taken included 2 and 3 \"replicate\" samples, per water sample, per day.  In some cases, only 1 sample (no replication) was taken, and in one instance, 4 \"replicate\" samples were taken. Data Files: PLOT 1 -32 and LTER 1 -32 contain means from each site for each date; however, caution must be used in using these data because some means may only be based on 1 sample from each site while the majority of the means are derived from 2 or 3 or 4 \"replicate\" samples.  The following table lists the site and date when only one \"replicate\" sample was taken from the water sample.

Sampling sites included Oyster Landing (OL), Town Creek (TC), and Clambank Creek (CB).  Usually only one 1-liter bottle of tidal creek water was collected from each site.  See the LTER Daily Water Sample (LTERDWS) published metadata for more information about other water chemistry analyses that were completed on this same water sample. </methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Laboratory Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> ATP Extraction and Analysis: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) was extracted in triplicate from each site's 1-liter water sample. Three 20-milliliter aliquots were filtered through sterilized Whatman GF/F 0.7 micron filters.  These extractions were filtered, frozen, and later analyzed on an SIA 3000 photometer to determine quantities of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). Each filter was placed in 5 milliliter of tris buffer which was boiling in a sand bath.  The filter was boiled for 5 minutes to fully release the ATP into the tris buffer.  When cool, the vial containing the tris buffer and the ATP was restored to its original level by the addition of sterile filtered water.  This replaced any liquid lost to evaporation during the boiling.  Analysis was done on an SAI integrating photometer in the peak height mode using luciferin purchased from Sigma Chemical Corp. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>O.

These numbers were entered into a computer system using the computer punch card technique.  The raw data was entered and edited by statistically comparing the coefficient of variances on each set of triplicates.  All computer work was accomplished by using the Conversational Monitoring System (CMS), which is part of the University of South Carolina's IBM Virtual Machine/System Product (VM/SP) computer system.  The edited data set was then used to generate means.  Each one of these steps was visually monitored for entry errors or omissions.  See Analytical Tools Section for more data processing and analysis.  All files were saved as ascii text in the mainframe computer, mass storage, and tape system on USC main campus. Data Capture of Original Raw and Final Data Files and Documentation (2002-2003) Original ascii text data files, which were uploaded in the 1980's to the main campus of the University of South Carolina's mainframe computer, were downloaded to Baruch Institute's data manager's personal computer in 2002. The original data files were archived onto CD and onto Baruch Field Laboratory's Data Management Server; they have not been modified and remain in ascii text format.  These original files were imported into Microsoft Excel 2000, reviewed and modified for rescue, documentation, and dissemination purposes. Rescue Process Data set file editing and description (June 2003): Original corrected \"triplicate\" files, LTERCO1-32, were imported into Microsoft Excel and saved for further rescue processing.  The Rescue Process file contains chem #, day.month.year, site, time, I Depth, Depth, ATP (grams per milliliter) times an Exponent, and ATP (grams per cubic meter) times an Exponent.  PLOT1-32, LTER1-32, and MONTHS were also imported and saved as Excel files.  File: LTER13 and PLOT1-32/PLOT13: problem with years jumping from 1983 to 1984 and then back to 1983 in the next file.  The problem was corrected by verifying the years with a final computer printout (blue IBM binder that was labeled LTERATP).  File: PLOT11 and PLOT12 are the same file, however PLOT11 does not contain the correct information and dates.  The problem was corrected by verifying the original data to the file LTER1-32.  PLOT1-32 and LTER1-32 contain the same information; however the files are sorted by different categories.  PLOT1-32 is sorted by month, day, year and LTER1-32 is sorted by site.  File: PLOT13: Two mean values were listed for one site for the same date which was erroneous. The data were corrected by comparing values with the corresponding LTERCO file. Data Verification, Editing, and Graphing (June 2003) The data files, LTERCO1-32, were merged into annual files.  The ATP values are originally listed as real numbers with exponents following the values.  As this is not a standard way to publish data, the data rescue team changed the notation of units from grams per milliliter to nanograms per milliliter.  This enabled us to remove the exponents in the final, rescued ATP data values.  For example: an original value of 0.2927 D-09 grams per milliliter was converted by the rescue team and recorded as 0.2927 nanograms per milliliter (i.e. the exponent D-09 equals 10-9, and a nanogram is equal to 10-9 grams).  The number of decimal places the data value had was changed to reflect the exponent value as shown below: &gt; &gt;0.2927 D-09 grams per milliliter = 0.2927 nanograms per milliliter &gt;0.0023 D-08 grams per milliliter = 0.0230 nanograms per milliliter &gt;0.0048 D-07 grams per milliliter = 0.4800 nanograms per milliliter &gt; Columns of data that were redundant for final dissemination purposes, were removed from the final database.  These were Time, IDepth, Depth, and ATP measured in grams per cubic meter.  Site codes of 1, 2, or 3 were changed to the letter codes: TC, OL, CB, respectively.  Missing data were inserted into the corrected \"triplicate\" files.  The computer program Sigma Plot was used to generate the graphs by year by site.  All triplicate values were plotted to help find anomalous data.  Anomalous data points were identified and then verified with original data. Anomalous Data: In the Data Rescue and Dissemination Project of 2003, Baruch's data managers found the following files to have erroneous data values and/or documentation and were corrected as described below. For a complete listing of data files and their content, go to the Distribution Section of this documentation. LTERCO Datafiles: Data values were plotted and based on data value patterns, the data from 10/28/1983 to 11/9/1983 at all three sample sites and from Oyster Landing on 3/26/1982 were listed as anomalous.  Caution should be used when using the data. This does not imply that the values are erroneous, just that they are suspect.  Data in October and November of 1983 are especially suspect; the values are all well above the normal for the season or year.  No mention of probable cause was listed in the original data documentation. File: LTERCO21: 1/15/84, SITE 3, value of 0.6888 D-03:  exponent looked out of place since other \"replicates\" were D-09, however, the value was compared with a final computer printout (blue IBM binder that was labeled LTERATP) and was corrected to 0.6888 D-09. Note: D-03 values =10-3; D-09 =10-9. File: LTERDMT: Data that was not actually missing were listed in the missing data section of the original LTERATP documentation file called LTERDMT.  The dates included 2/24/1983 - TC, 11/15/1983 - TC, OL, CB, 4/8/1984 - CB and 4/9/1984 - CB.  This was corrected in the missing documentation located within this FGDC metadata document. File: LTERCO1-32 lists the sample depth as 0.1 meter, but the original documentation lists it as 50 centimeters (0.50meters).  The data managers of the Data Rescue and Dissemination project verified that the water samples were taken at the 0.5 meter depth. Creation of Final Rescued/Disseminated Databases (June 2003) The final, disseminated LTERCO file was renamed as LTERATP.CB.1981-1985 or LTERATP.OL.1981-1985 or LTERATP.TC.1981-1985; all five years were combined into one file for each site.  They contain 3 variables: Date, Site, and ATP measured in nanograms per milliliter.  The LTERATP.1981-1985 files were used to create a mean with standard error files, using Statistical Analysis System (SAS).  These summary data files called ATPMEAN.CB or OL or TC.1981-1985 were exported into Microsoft Excel 2000 and then graphed using Sigma Plot.  Both the triplicate LTERATP.1981-1985 files and ATPMEAN.81-85 files were saved as Excel and .csv formatted files.  All plots were exported as .jpg images. Data Archive and Dissemination of Rescued Data, Documentation, and Graphics (July 2003) Rescued final data, graphics, and metadata are all printed out into a hardcopy paper version and also burned onto CD. All original ascii text data was also burned to CD; the hardcopy and CD versions are compiled into a 3-ring binder notebook and stored at the BMFL Computer Laboratory.  All original printed documentation is also in the 3-ring notebook.  CD's of the Original files and Rescued Final data files are kept in a fireproof cabinet at the BMFL data manager's office.  Final data, graphics, and metadata are also available on Baruch Institute's web site: http://links.baruch.sc.edu/data/ and archived on Baruch's Rescue Server.  Metadata are published on the BMFL's Isite Node.
