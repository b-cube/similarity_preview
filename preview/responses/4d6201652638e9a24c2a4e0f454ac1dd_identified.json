Biological samples were collected from Atlantic bluefin tuna landed by the commercial and recreational fisheries in New England. Due to the timing of this award, the authors used these funds to sample Atlantic bluefin tuna from 1 Sept 2011 to 8 Oct 2011 and through the 2012 bluefin commercial season, 1 Jun to 7 Nov 2012. They combined fish sampled from this award with samples collected from the two previous years, projects supported by other funding sources. The total number of fish sampled has increased year to year with a total of 334, 493 and 692 fish sampled for years 2010, 2011, and 2012 respectively. Since the timing of the award was out of phase with the bluefin tuna sampling season, researchers conducted age and growth analysis on samples previously collected in 2010 and 2011. This research project sought to collect representative biological samples from juvenile and adult bluefin tuna to support age and growth analysis as well as reproductive status for integration into stock assessment for western Atlantic bluefin tuna.   </abstract>          <purpose>To collect representative biological samples from juvenile and adult bluefin tuna to support age and growth analysis as well as reproductive status for integration into stock assessment for western Atlantic</purpose>          <supplinf/>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>20110901</begdate>                <enddate>20130831</enddate>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current>                                     ground condition                                 </current>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>                                 In work                             </progress>          <update/>       </status>       <spdom>          <bounding>             <westbc/>             <eastbc/>             <northbc/>             <southbc/>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>None</themekt>             <themekey>Walter Golet</themekey>             <themekey>Molly Lutcavage</themekey>             <themekey>NA11NMF4720109</themekey>             <themekey>biological data</themekey>             <themekey>hard parts</themekey>             <themekey>heavy metal analysis</themekey>             <themekey>ICCAT</themekey>             <themekey>length</themekey>             <themekey>weight</themekey>             <themekey>gonadosomatic index</themekey>             <themekey>sex determination</themekey>             <themekey>maturity status</themekey>             <themekey>otoliths</themekey>             <themekey>dorsal spines</themekey>             <themekey>bluefin tuna</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>NMFS Data Category</themekt>             <themekey>Bio-Sampling</themekey>          </theme>          <place>             <placekt>None</placekt>             <placekey>atlantic ocean</placekey>             <placekey>bahamas</placekey>          </place>          <temporal>             <tempkt>None</tempkt>             <tempkey>2011-2012</tempkey>          </temporal>       </keywords>       <accconst>The project data is not available for online viewing or downloading.</accconst>       <useconst>The intent of CRP projects, and the data collected from these projects, is to aid in recovering, maintaining, or improving the status of stocks upon which fisheries depend; improving the understanding of factors affecting recruitment success and long-term sustainability of fisheries; and/or generating increased values and opportunities for fisheries.
