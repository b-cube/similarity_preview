Its chief deliverable is a set of Guidelines which specify encoding methods                 for machine-readable texts, chiefly in the humanities, social sciences                 and linguistics. Since 1994, the TEI Guidelines have been widely                  used by libraries, museums, publishers, and individual scholars                  to present texts for online research, teaching, and preservation.                  In addition to the Guidelines themselves, the Consortium provides a variety                  of <ref target=\"Support/Learn/\">resources</ref> and                  <ref target=\"http://members.tei-c.org/Events\">training events</ref> for                  learning TEI, information on <ref target=\"Activities/Projects/\">projects                  using the TEI</ref>, a <ref target=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/SIG/Education/tei_bibliography.xml\">bibliography of TEI-related publications</ref>,                 and <ref target=\"Tools/\">software</ref> developed for or adapted to the TEI.             </p>                          <p>The TEI Consortium is a nonprofit membership organization                 composed of academic institutions, research projects, and individual                 scholars from around the world.  Members contribute financially to the                  Consortium and elect representatives to its Council and Board of Directors.</p>                                      <p>Want to become active in the TEI community? <ref target=\"http://members.tei-c.org/join\">Become a TEI Member</ref>, join a <ref target=\"Activities/SIG/\">special interest group</ref>, sign up for the                 <ref target=\"Support/index.xml#tei-l\">TEI-L mailing list</ref>, and come to our <ref target=\"http://members.tei-c.org/Events/meetings\">annual                 conferences and members' meetings</ref>. </p>           </body>               </text> </TEI>",
