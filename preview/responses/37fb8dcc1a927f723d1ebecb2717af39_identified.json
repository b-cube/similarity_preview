IKONOS imagery used in producing this land cover product was also utilized in producing an associated impervious surfaces layer for the island. The mapping approach utilized an object oriented approach.  A calibration visit was not conducted. Non impervious features were mapped using a 0.5 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU).Pre-processing steps:The IKONOS mosaic utilized for this project was provided from GeoEye as an orthorectifed, georeferenced product and was consistent with the quoted 1:12000 spatial accuracy.Classification:Segmentation - Image segmentation was completed at a single scale using the multispectral (4 m) imagery in order to group like spectral and textural objects within the imagery. For consistency, the associated impervious data set was incorporated into the segmentation layer as a boundary delimiter. Segments can share boundaries of an impervious surface, but can never overlap an impervious surface.Automated Classification - Image segments are classified using a decision tree classifier in See5 software and an iterative nearest neighbor classifier in Definiens software.  Nearest neighbor training data is collected through analyst interpretation or ancillary data sets and used to calibrate the classification algorithm.Automated Classification Refinement - Models are built to refine or reclassify land cover areas by utilizing the wealth of attribute information linked to each segment within Definiens.Classification Edits - As with any automated or semi-automated land cover classification there are often inconsistencies in the land cover map. The final step before map finalization was to remove inaccuracies through manual segment labeling as interpreted by an analyst.Map Finalization - Sanborn used independent re viewer's comments to further refine the land cover map.Attributes for this product are as follows: 0 Background, 1 Unclassified, 2 Impervious, 345 Developed, Open Space, 6 Cultivated Crops, 7 Pasture/Hay, 8 Grassland/Herbaceous, 9 Deciduous Forest, 10 Evergreen Forest, 11 Mixed Forest, 12 Scrub/Shrub, 13 Palustrine Forested Wetland, 14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland, 15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland, 16 Estuarine Forested Wetland, 17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland, 18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland, 19 Unconsolidated Shore, 20 Bare Land21 Open Water, 22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed </procdesc>     <procdate>20091217 </procdate>     <proccont>      <cntinfo>       <cntperp>        <cntper>CRS (Coastal Remote Sensing) Program Manager </cntper>        <cntorg>NOAA Coastal Services Center Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) </cntorg>       </cntperp>       <cntpos>CRS Program Manager </cntpos>       <cntaddr>        <addrtype>mailing and physical </addrtype>        <address>2234 S.
