The act of making theatre is labor intensive, expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, it takes conscious choice to become part of a theatre audience. One must come together as part of a group in a physical space that is reserved especially for that purpose. And then one must remain alert and engaged with the story throughout, usually through quietly listening and watching, and occasionally by following instructions for some sort of participation. The flexibility of stopping and starting the event does not exist as it does in film and television. And there are commercials. Theatre audiences have made a commitment to participate in an event. Yet, this participation is lacking by today's networked and collaborative standards. Other modes of storytelling, such as the plethora of free and low cost social networking platforms and the increasingly elaborate worlds of video game technology provide \"the ability to insert yourself directly into the story.\" Many theatre practitioners and indeed more devout audience members, may argue that theatre is simply not part of this dichotomy - that our art form does not and should not compete with mass media culture. To which I would say - whether or not we like it, we already are. At its most basic function, theatre is a form of storytelling. As are film and television, and - despite people's lack of awareness of the fact - as are social media and video games. So how does theatre prove its worth in the face of these other options? How does the medium remain relevant in today's rapidly changing, media saturated world?</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>",
