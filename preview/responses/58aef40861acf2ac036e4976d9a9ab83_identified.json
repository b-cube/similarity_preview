The vector data file is included in \"Faults_DrakesBay.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/DrakesBay/data_catalog_DrakesBay.html.  Faults in the Drakes Bay and Vicinity map area are identified on seismic-reflection data based on abrupt truncation or warping of reflections and (or) juxtaposition of reflection panels with different seismic parameters such as reflection presence, amplitude, frequency, geometry, continuity, and vertical sequence. The Point Reyes Fault Zone runs through the map area and is an offshore curvilinear reverse fault zone with predominantly north-side-up motion (Hoskins and Griffiths, 1971; McCulloch, 1987; Heck and others, 1990; Stozek, 2012) that likely connects with the western San Gregorio fault further to the south (Ryan and others, 2008), making it part of the San Andreas Fault System. The Point Reyes Fault Zone is characterized by a 5 to 11 km-wide zone of deformation in the shallow subsurface that is associated with two main fault structures, the Point Reyes Fault and the western Point Reyes Fault. Near the Point Reyes headland, vertical displacement of granitic basement across the Point Reyes Fault is at least 1.4 km (McCulloch, 1987). Offshore Double Point, vertical displacement on the Point Reyes Fault is difficult to assess because subsurface age constraints from nearby wells are lacking, and there are few offset horizons across the fault imaged on available seismic data. However, warping and folding of Neogene strata are clearly visible on high-resolution seismic data (see field activity S-8-09-NC). The western Point Reyes Fault is defined by a broad anticlinal structure visible in both industry and high-resolution seismic datasets that exhibits that same sense of vergence (north-side-up) as the Point Reyes Fault.  Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field activity S-8-09-NC). The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2006 and 2009.

Faults lines were digitized by heads-up screen digitization on to shot-point picks from seismic-line navigation data - each shot point has an associated lat/long in the survey data. Error is introduced from layback, as well as from interpretation of oblique features, so horizontal accuracy of fault and fold location is estimated to be on the order of 10 to 20 meters. </horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP)</origin> <pubdate>2013</pubdate> <title>Subbottom survey data of field activity S-8-09-NC in Stinson Beach to Point Arena (CA) from 09/08/2009 to 09/30/2009</title> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Menlo Park, CA</pubplace> <publish>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , Coastal and Marine Geology (CMG)</publish> </pubinfo> <onlink>http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/gos/s-8-09-nc.fmeta.xml</onlink> <onlink>http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/s/s809nc/html/s-8-09-nc.meta.html</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>ASCII lat/long shot point files</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20090908</begdate> <enddate>20090930</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>S-8-09-NC</srccitea> <srccontr>Digital seismic data used to interpret subsurface geologic structure</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> Faults were mapped onto shot lines based on the latitude and longitude of seismic picks from field activity S-8-09-NC. </procdesc> <procdate>2011</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> <ptvctinf> <sdtsterm> <sdtstype>String</sdtstype> <ptvctcnt>2</ptvctcnt> </sdtsterm> </ptvctinf> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn>WGS 1984 UTM Zone 10N</mapprojn> <transmer> <sfctrmer>0.9996</sfctrmer> <longcm>-123.0</longcm> <latprjo>0.0</latprjo> <feast>500000.0</feast> <fnorth>0.0</fnorth> </transmer> </mapproj> <planci> <plance>coordinate pair</plance> <coordrep> <absres>0.0001</absres> <ordres>0.0001</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>Meter</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>D WGS 1984</horizdn> <ellips>WGS 1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257223563</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>Faults</enttypl> <enttypd>lines representing mapped faults</enttypd> <enttypds>This report</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>OBJECTID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl> <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Label</attrlabl> <attrdef>feature label</attrdef> <attrdefs>This report</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>text field containing feature names if they are named</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>RuleID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Representation rule identifier</attrdef> <attrdefs>This report</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom> This field contains the representation rule in the ArcGIS file geodatabase that applied dashed or solid lines to faults.
