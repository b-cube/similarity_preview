There are non-public schools in and outside of the MDE program that are not covered in this database. Locations have not gone through an extensive QA/QC process.</abstract> <purpose>MDE has been developing school program locations, both public and nonpublic, since 1998 in coordination with the Land Management Information Center (LMIC).  Nonpublic school locations is an addition to the existing public and charter school database. Initially developed in 1998-1999, this is the first major update of that original file.</purpose> <supplinf>Minnesota</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2007</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Non-Public school program locations updated for school year 2006-2007.</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Annually</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-97.071908</westbc> <eastbc>-91.152757</eastbc> <northbc>48.626078</northbc> <southbc>43.476096</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>structure, school, nonpublic school</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekey>Minnesota</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>If you obtain data from MDE, it is understood that you and/or your organization have the right to use them for any internal purpose.

No modifications were made until 2005.  December 2005: In December, 2005, LMIC was provided a database from FNS containing all nonpublic schools. LMIC took this database and initially processed it against the existing Public school database to find duplicates. The remaining locations were geocoded in ArcMAP 9.1 using the most current TLG (The Lawrence Group) street centerline database and U.S. Census TIGER street database. Remaining unmatched addresses were tested online with Google maps and locations were found.  Some locations have been verified using FSA NAIP aerial photography. All others are unverified and may vary from exact location to centroid of a city or zip code.  December 2006: The Department of Education, Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) took ownership of this spatial database and made modifications based on data from the MDE database dated December 2006. Only Unit Classifications of 31-35 were developed in this spatial database. All others were discarded.</procdesc> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref></indspref> <direct>Point</direct> <mgmg3obj>Point</mgmg3obj> <mgmg3til>State</mgmg3til> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres></latres> <longres></longres> </geograph> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn></mapprojn> <mgmg4par></mgmg4par> <otherprj></otherprj> </mapproj> <gridsys> <gridsysn>UTM</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>15E</utmzone> </utm> <spcs> <spcszone></spcszone> </spcs> <mgmg4coz></mgmg4coz> <mgmg4adj></mgmg4adj> </gridsys> <planci> <coordrep> <absres></absres> <ordres></ordres> </coordrep> <distbrep> <distres></distres> </distbrep> <plandu>Meters</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>NAD83</horizdn> <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum>Not applicable</altdatum> <altunits></altunits> </altsys> <depthsys> <depthdn>Not applicable</depthdn> <depthdu></depthdu> </depthsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>UNI_TYP (2,2,I) - 2 digit MDE unit classification.

GIS data:  this data set is distributed on the internet by clicking below after Online Linkage.  Doing so will tell your browser to start downloading a self-extracting 'ZIP' file which will contain the following:  - Data in shapefile (.shp, .shx., .dbf) format - Documentation (.html) - NOTICE.RTF, an important notice about this data set that can be read by most word processing software, and an ascii text version of the same notice (NOTICE.TXT)  After downloading this self-extracting 'zip' file (which will have an 'exe' extension), simply execute (run) the file.  (For example, you can double click it from Windows Explorer or File Manager).  Doing this will automatically extract the files described above.  2.
