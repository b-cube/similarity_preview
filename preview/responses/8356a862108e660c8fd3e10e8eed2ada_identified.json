The city was home to high chiefs and others from about 1250 until the mid-nineteenth century, when whalers, traders, and missionaries started to arrive on the island. Leluh features canals and walled compounds built of basalt, and temporary, pyramid-shaped tombs, or &lt;em&gt;saru&lt;/em&gt;, built from living coral. Historical sources indicate that when Kosraean high chiefs died, their bodies were rubbed with coconut oil and then wrapped in mats and cords to be buried in the &lt;em&gt;saru&lt;/em&gt; for up to three months. The bones were later exhumed, cleaned, and reburied in a hole on the nearby reef. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdToday, the ancient tombs of the royal burial complexes are one of the few parts of the ancient Leluh site that remain intact. Much of the historical site is overgrown by the tropical forest and has succumbed to hundreds of years of tropical weather and tidal inundation, and some parts of the site have been dismantled and reused in modern construction,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Zoe Richards of the Western Australian Museum told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livescience.com/50135-coral-tombs-leluh-700-years-old.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

The city was home to high chiefs and others from about 1250 until the mid-nineteenth century, when whalers, traders, and missionaries started to arrive on the island. Leluh features canals and walled compounds built of basalt, and temporary, pyramid-shaped tombs, or &lt;em&gt;saru&lt;/em&gt;, built from living coral. Historical sources indicate that when Kosraean high chiefs died, their bodies were rubbed with coconut oil and then wrapped in mats and cords to be buried in the &lt;em&gt;saru&lt;/em&gt; for up to three months. The bones were later exhumed, cleaned, and reburied in a hole on the nearby reef. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdToday, the ancient tombs of the royal burial complexes are one of the few parts of the ancient Leluh site that remain intact.
