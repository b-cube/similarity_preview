The Flower Garden Banks (FGB) are located in the northwest Gulf of Mexico and are unique within the region. Although coral species richness is lower at the FGB than on Caribbean reefs, 31 species of scleractinian corals have been documented as well as 177 species of tropical Atlantic fish. Annual monitoring is conducted at the East and West Flower Garden Banks within 100 m by 100 m study sites. These data are the results of the 2007 and 2008 monitoring events and are presented in technical reports and presentations. The data included in this accession are: (1) random transect data (i.e., percent cover of benthic components) obtained from videography (2007 and 2008); (2) sclerochronology data calculated from 2007 cores, showing short-term coral growth rates; (3) lateral growth/recession of marked Diploria strigosa colony margins calculated from annual photographs (2006-2007); (4) percent cover of benthic components and coverage of coral bleaching, paling, fish biting, and disease (2007 and 2008) and planimetry data (gain/loss in area of specific coral colonies from 2006-2007 and 2007-2008) acquired from repetitive 8m2 quadrat photographs; (5) water quality data recorded on YSI datasondes, Sea-Bird SBE 37-SMP MicroCAT, and Hobotemp thermographs and water chemistry results including nutrients (2006-2008); and (6) annual fish population surveys to monitor species abundance and size over time (2007). Statistical analyses, photographs, and videography are not included in this submission. Photographs and video collected during the 2007 and 2008 monitoring events were placed on DVD and sent to NODC via mail. These photographs and videos were placed in individual folders within this accession at the NODC.The Long-Term Monitoring at the East and West Flower Garden Banks 2007-2008 data include biological and oceanographic data collected to satisfy the BOEMRE and NOAA contract 1435-01-04-CT-33137 (M04PC00033) for years 2007 and 2008 (years 2002-2006 previously submitted to NODC in December 2006).       </abstract>       <purpose>         The purpose of these biological and oceanographic data is to serve as a long-term record of the conditions of the coral reef communities within the Flower Garden Banks study sites. BOEMRE and NOAA continue environmental monitoring for continuity of data and for generating information needed for resource management and regulatory decision-making. In addition, the monitoring data are needed to validate and sustain the present understanding of BOEMRE lease stipulations for providing effective mitigation of impacts to the offshore environment.       </purpose>       <supplinf>         Resource Description: NODC Accession number 0070125       </supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>             20070611           </begdate>           <begtime>             Unknown           </begtime>           <enddate>             20081106           </enddate>           <endtime>             Unknown           </endtime>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>         ground condition       </current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>         Complete       </progress>       <update>         None Planned       </update>     </status>     <spdom>       <descgeog>         Reefs of the East and West Flower Garden Banks, app. 70-115 miles off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico.       </descgeog>       <bounding>         <westbc>           -93.598361         </westbc>         <eastbc>           -93.596944         </eastbc>         <northbc>           27.908861         </northbc>         <southbc>           27.875167         </southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>           ISO 19115 Topic Category         </themekt>         <themekey>           biota         </themekey>         <themekey>           002         </themekey>         <themekey>           environment         </themekey>         <themekey>           007         </themekey>         <themekey>           oceans         </themekey>         <themekey>           014         </themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>           Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) Science Keywords         </themekt>         <themekey>           Biosphere &gt;

Sclerochronology: Annual growth bands, as measured from high density band to high density band in a longitudinally sectioned core.  Lateral growth of Diploria strigosa colonies: difference in area (cm2) at the margins of Diploria strigosa colonies and proportional change from year to year.  Repetitive 8 m2 quadrats: percent cover of corals identified to species, sponges were combined into a single group or identified to species when possible, macroalgae were identified to species when possible and included anything longer than approximately 3mm. Crustose coralline algae, fine turfs and bare rock were grouped as CTB (crustose coralline, turf, and bare).  Additional categories included cyanobacteria, other live, sand and rubble, and unknown.
