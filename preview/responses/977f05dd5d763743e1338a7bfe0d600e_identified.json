Fish targets included large groupers (red hind, Nassau, yellowfin, black), snappers (mutton, cubera, dog, schoolmaster, yellowtail), large parrotfish (midnight, blue, rainbow), hogfish, queen triggerfish, lionfish, great barracuda, and sharks. Shellfish targets included spiny lobster and queen conch. Mesophotic benthic habitats at sites surveyed included reef tops, slope walls and rhodolith reefs at ALS; slope walls, patch reefs with colonized pavement and rhodolith reefs at Des; and rock reef promontories and rhodolith reef at BDS. The objectives of the study were: 1) to characterize the main species assemblages present from each of the benthic habitats and depths surveyed; 2) analyze variations of the species assemblages between sites; 3) provide rough estimates of population size for target species based on field estimated densities and benthic habitat areas at each site; 3) convey preliminary analysis of the status of the populations within the mesophotic habitats surveyed based on the length frequency data; 4) provide inferences of seasonal variations by species at ALS, with particular interest on queen conch; and 5) produce underwater video and photo documentation of the main benthic habitats and species observed. A series of eight (8) belt-transects, approximately 250 m long x 6 m wide (1,500 m2 each) were visually surveyed by rebreather divers from the three main mesophotic benthic habitats at each site. At ALS, three seasonal surveys were performed. The total sampling effort produced a total of 120 transects, covering a total area of 194,438 m2 of benthic habitat from mesophotic reef sites within the Puertorrican EEZ. Visual (total) length estimates of each fish individual was recorded on each transect surveyed, as well as the cephalothorax length of spiny lobster. Total lengths and shell width (inside the lip) of queen conch were measured with a ruler. Fish/shellfish density data was reported as individuals/1000m2. Marked variations in the composition and abundance of several commercially important fish and shellfish populations between sites were noted. Higher abundance of queen conch, large snappers (mutton, dog, cubera) and hogfish were observed from at ALS, as compared to Des and BDS. Given the similarity of benthic habitat types between sites and the habitat plasticity exhibited by most of the aforementioned species, it is proposed that the sharp differences in population size and species composition of commercially important fish and shellfish populations is related to the recruitment enhancement effect provided by the within shelf connectivity between nursery and mesophotic habitats at ALS, compared to the partial isolation imposed by the oceanic barrier of Mona Passage separating Des and BDS from the PR shelf. Several populations evidenced marked preferences for particular benthic habitats. For example: more than 90% of all queen conchs from all sites were observed from the rhodolith reef. Conversely, spiny lobsters, groupers, hogfishes, lionfishes and snappers, with the exception of mutton snapper, were more abundant at the reef top and slope wall habitats than at the rhodolith reef. Queen conch was more abundant during the August September survey, coinciding with their peak reproductive season at ALS. Couples of queen conchs were observed engaged in copulation and egg masses discovered buried on the rhodolith habitat at depths ranging between 38 - 45m (125 - 145 feet) during the August-September survey season. Based on field density estimates at the various habitat types and the corresponding benthic habitat areas, it is calculated that the population of queen conch within mesophotic habitats of ALS was in the order of 20,000 to 30, 000 individuals during our 2011-2012 survey period. As such, queen conch represents the most valuable stock within the PR EEZ area included in this survey. Queen conch stocks from mesophotic habitats at Des and BDS were estimated in the order of several hundred individuals. Fish and shellfish population size assessments were constrained by the low proportion of the surveyed habitat relative to the total (e.g. 3.6 % at ALS; 4.5 % at BDS; unknown at Des) and the low numbers of individuals sighted, particularly for the large grouper/snapper assemblage. From the available data, stocks of red hind, schoolmaster snapper, lionfish and queen triggerfish were estimated in the low thousands (1,000 5,000 Ind) within mesophotic habitats at ALS, and in the low to mid hundreds at BDS. There is no data on benthic habitat areas for Des and thus, population estimates are not yet feasible from our survey data. Stocks of large groupers (Nassau, yellowfin, black) and snappers (cubera, dog, mutton) were estimated in the low to mid hundreds within mesophotic habitats at ALS, and in the low hundreds at BDS. Red hind presented a modal size just above the size at first reproduction, with a relatively low proportion of large individuals, and maximum size well under that reported for the Caribbean Antilles, which may be indicative of high fishing pressure on this species. Large groupers (Nassau, yellowfin, blackfin) and snappers (cubera, dog, mutton), as well as hogfish and queen triggerfish all presented size distributions well over the length at first reproduction, with some individuals approaching the maximum sizes reported for the Caribbean Antilles, indicative that mesophotic habitats are prime residential, foraging, and reproductive grounds for adult fish and shellfish populations of commercial value within the PR EEZ. Within the constraints imposed by the small sample sizes, these data suggests that these stocks are presently not being overfished within the mesophotic habitats surveyed, and may support an alternative theory of ecosystem low carrying capacity, where in a scenario of relatively low availability of food resources, a few large individuals dominate large foraging areas. The scarcity of sharks evidenced during our surveys tends to support the theory of low carrying capacity that these mesophotic habitats naturally convey for large fish predators. Lionfish (Pterois volitans), conversely, exhibited a size distribution encompassing the entire range for the species, from settlement juveniles to maximum size adults, indicative that mesophotic habitats function as recruitment, residential, foraging and perhaps reproductive habitats for this species. The high proportion of large adult individuals in the population may be associated to the virtual lack of fishing pressure on this species.\" </Abstract>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20140918000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/other/grants/Domestic_FMC_CoRIS_Products/NA10NMF4410060_FinalReport.pdf </URL>  <Region>PR </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-65.248715 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>-67.399870 </Westbc>  <Southbc>17.784130 </Southbc>  <Northbc>18.645740 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>techreport </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>Grants </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>techreport </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
