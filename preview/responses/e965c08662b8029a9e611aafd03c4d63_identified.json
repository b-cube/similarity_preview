Maciolek (1984) listed 19 species of diadromous and marine fishes to be present in Hawaiian waters, which was increased to 21 marine species by Randall (1987), about 4% of a total of 536 Hawaiian shore fish species (Randall 1992). Carlton and Eldredge (in prep.) reviewed the marine and brackish water invertebrates of Hawai&amp;oacute;i and determined approximately 205 species to be demonstrably or potentially nonindigenous, again about 4% of the approximate 5000 marine species estimated for Hawai&amp;oacute;i (Allison et al. 1995). Approximately 18 species of macroalgae have been introduced to Hawai&amp;oacute;i since 1950 (Russell 1992, Rogers 1997, 1999), again about 4% of the approximately 430 estimated total macroalgal species for Hawai&amp;oacute;i (G. Smith, pers. comm.).  Baseline studies of Hawaiian nearshore marine biota directed toward the detection of introduced species and their impact have shown that nonindigenous introductions vary substantially from these average values, depending on the characteristics of the area surveyed. The most comprehensive survey conducted to date, a 1996 survey completed in Pearl Harbor (Coles et al. 1997; 1999), found 95 known or potentially nonindigenous species, which composed 23% of the 419 invertebrates, macroalgae, and fishes found. Only three nonindigenous invertebrates and one nonidigenous fish occurred at Midway Atoll in 1997 out of a total 444 taxa found (DeFelice et al. 1998). No nonindigenous algae or invertebrates were found in the nearshore and intertidal of Kaho&amp;oacute;olawe Island in 1998 out of a total of 298 species observed or collected (Coles et al. 1998).  Despite the potential importance of Honolulu Harbor or other commercial harbors on Oahu as potential gateways for nonindigenous marine species to enter the Hawaiian marine ecosystem, no studies have previously been conducted of introduced species in Hawaiian commercial harbors, and little information is available for the composition of the marine communities for these harbors. Therefore, surveys were conducted in Honolulu Harbor and Keehi Lagoon in 1997, and in Kewalo Basin, the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor and the Barbers Point Deep Draft Harbor in 1998. The results of this study are reported herein and the presence and impact of nonindigenous marine introductions in these harbors are evaluated </abstract> <purpose>To examine introduced marine species and the composition of marine communities in Hawaiian commercial harbors.</purpose> <supplinf> Studies of nonindigenous introductions in stream mouths along Oahu&amp;oacute;s south and west shores and a evaluation of the role of hull fouling, ballast water and sediments as vectors for marine introductions were conducted as part of this overall project and will be reported in separate reports. </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19970820</begdate> <enddate>19980806</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-157.92</westbc> <eastbc>-157.12</eastbc> <northbc>21.332</northbc> <southbc>21.283</southbc> </bounding> <descgeog>Honolulu Harbor, Keehi Lagoon, Kewalo Basin, the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, and the Barbers Point Deep Draft Harbor, HI</descgeog> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt> <themekey>Numeric Data Sets &gt; Biology</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt> <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Dominance &gt; Invasive Species</themekey> <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Marine Invertebrates</themekey> <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Marine Invertebrates &gt; Macroinvertebrates</themekey> <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Marine Invertebrates &gt; Census</themekey> <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Aquatic Habitat &gt; Coastal Habitat</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>biota</themekey> <themekey>002</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt> <placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Pacific Ocean &gt; Central Pacific Ocean &gt; Hawaiian Islands &gt; Oahu Island &gt; Oahu (21N157W0003)</placekey> <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Hawaii &gt; Honolulu &gt; Oahu (21N157W0003)</placekey> <placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Pacific Ocean &gt; Central Pacific Ocean &gt; Hawaiian Islands &gt; Oahu Island &gt; Barber&apos;s Point (21N158W0003)</placekey> <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Hawaii &gt; Honolulu &gt; Barber&apos;s Point (21N158W0003)</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Honolulu Harbor</placekey> <placekey>Keehi Lagoon</placekey> <placekey>Kewalo Basin</placekey> <placekey>Ala Wai Yacht Harbor</placekey> <placekey>Barbers Point Deep Draft Harbor</placekey> </place> <stratum> <stratkt>None</stratkt> <stratkey>Benthos</stratkey> </stratum> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst> Dataset credit required.

south shore of Oahu were examined. Literature consulted included published papers in the open scientific literature, taxonomy-based monographs and books, unpublished reports for environmental studies in the harbors, and newspaper and magazine articles that were concerned with the development or environmental and biological communities of the harbors. Resources that were consulted in this search were the libraries of Bishop Museum, the University of Hawaii, and the Pacific Maritime Center. Environmental reports and Environmental Impact Statements and Assessments were reviewed from the University of Hawai&amp;oacute;i Environmental Center, the Hawaiian Electric Co. Environmental Department and AECOS Inc. An annotated bibliography of all the literature assembled is presented in Appendix B of the main report included in this data set.  Bernice P. Bishop Museum Collections -  Bishop Museum collections databases for algae, invertebrates, malacology and ichthyology were reviewed for all marine or estuarine organisms indicated to have been collected in Honolulu Harbor, Keehi Lagoon, Kewalo Basin, the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor or the Barbers Point Deep Draft Harbor. The retrieved data were assembled into a combined database for Oahu south shore harbors (other than Pearl Harbor) containing taxa identity, taxonomic authority, collection location and date, collector and collectors notes, when available. This information is included with the general listing of all taxa for the study developed from all sources and presented in Appendix C of the main report included in this data set.  Data Analysis -  All organisms identified from the current field study were entered on an Access database relational with the databases for previous literature reports and museum collections of organisms from Pearl Harbor.

Station locations, coordinates and dates of sampling are given in Table 1, and station locations are shown in Figures 10-12 in the original data document.  The sampling and analysis process is summarized in Figure 13 in the original data document. Collections and observations were made by two experienced investigators sampling as large a variety of habitats as possible at each station while snorkeling or using Scuba. One diver sampled fouling organisms growing on hard surfaces from the intertidal zone to the bottom by scraping three samples of approximately 0.1 m2 each. The other diver observed fishes swimming in the area, recorded their identities and also noted the presence of abundant invertebrate megafauna and macroalgae. Collected organisms, which range 4-8 liters in total volume for each station were inspected on site and selected hydroids and tunicates were removed to be relaxed in a solution of Epsom salts and seawater before preserving in 5% formalin. The remaining organisms were preserved on site in 70% alcohol before returning the samples to the laboratory for sorting and identification of organisms.  Sediment-dwelling organisms and their substratum were collected by inserting a 12.5 cm diameter cylinder 15 cm into the sediment, closing off the bottom and top with lids and then transporting the sample to the laboratory where it was sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh size screen. A subsample of 10 to 25 cm3 was retained from each sample for determination of micromollusc populations.  Specimens collected were sorted and identified to species or the lowest practicable taxa, using dissecting or compound microscope magnification when necessary. Identifications were made using descriptions available in Reef and Shore Fauna of Hawai&amp;oacute;i Sections 1 to 4 (published), 5 and 6 (unpublished), various taxonomic references, and voucher specimens in the Bishop Museum collections. Specimens from various groups were sent to taxonomic experts for verification of preliminary identifications (see Acknowledgments). </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Dr. Steve Coles, Ralph C.
