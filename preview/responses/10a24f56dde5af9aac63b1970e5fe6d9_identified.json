ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to   these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><list type=\"bulleted\">  <itm>Created variable labels and/or value labels.</itm><itm>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</itm>  </list>  </cleanOps>              </dataColl>       <notes>                 The April 1, 1990, Census figures are shown as originally tabulated and do not reflect any post-Census corrections or updates which may have occurred.         </notes>                  <notes>                 The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program (PEP) produces July 1 estimates for years after the last published decennial census (1990), as well as for past decades. Existing data series such as births, deaths, federal tax returns, medicare enrollment, and immigration, are used to update the decennial census base counts. PEP estimates are used in federal funding allocations, in setting the levels of national surveys, and in monitoring recent demographic changes. A methodology reference accompanies most of the population estimates offerings.         </notes>                  <notes>                                          <p>Revisions to estimates and geographic detail:</p><p>With each new issue of July 1 estimates, PEP revises estimates for years back to the last census. Previously released estimates become superseded. Revisions to estimates are usually due to input data updates, changes in methodology, or legal boundary changes.
