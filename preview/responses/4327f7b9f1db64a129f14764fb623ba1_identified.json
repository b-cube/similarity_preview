The personal consequences of FGM include physical, emotional and psychological trauma for those who survive and can also lead to death due to haemorrhage or infection, including tetanus, and shock.</p> <p>Although FGM is normally practised in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, it is no longer restricted to these geographical areas due to increasing globalisation. In the UK, it has been estimated that over 20,000 girls under the age of 15 are at risk of FGM each year, and that 66,000 women in the UK are living with the consequences of FGM.</p> <p>In 2011 Eva Organization for Women (EOW-Charity) in collaboration with the University of Leicester hosted its first impactnational FGM Conference at the University of Leicester; this was a resounding success in bringing together community leaders and religious scholars, health professionals and legal practitioners and victims of this illegal but still practised tradition to raise awareness.</p> <p>Again, EOW-Charity is hosting a symposium on Friday 6 March 2015 at the University of Leicester which will provide a unique opportunity to gain invaluable perspective, insight and best practice and understanding of the current framework of FGM. This symposium will also highlight the importance of three dimensional approaches (community leaders/religious scholars, professional practitioners and local authors) which needs to be strengthened in order to ensure better awareness, early intervention and prevention of FGM, so that together we help these who really need our support. We at EOW believe that education is the way forward to eradicate FGM; therefore, in this symposium we are also launching an educational package for both professionals and communities alike.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>User Submitted</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>College:SocSci</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>College:MedBioPsych</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Event:Conference</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-06T09:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>UoL Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/march/an-update-on-therapeutic-aerosols-within-and-beyond-the-lungs\">     <title>'An update on therapeutic aerosols: within and beyond the lungs'</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/march/an-update-on-therapeutic-aerosols-within-and-beyond-the-lungs</link>     <description>Clinical Education Centre, Glenfield Hospital - 20 Mar 2015, 01:00PM  - 02:00PM </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Department of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy &amp; Thoracic Surgery University Hospitals of Leicester Institute of Lung Health</p> <p>Dr Omar Usmani, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, will present a seminar on Friday 20th March 1300-1400.</p> <p>Lunch will be provided in the CEC Lounge at 1230.
