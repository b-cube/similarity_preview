The report is an independent scientific review by over 40 scientists of the Sustainable Development Goals targets, with a view to assist their consolidation, and support their effective implementation and monitoring. The event brought together a wide range of stakeholders, government delegates and UN staff. Altogether, about 70 people attended.</p> <p>Several scientists who contributed to the review were present to discuss and illustrate the role of science in defining measurable targets and robust indicators to support the ambition of the SDGs. Lucilla Spini, Head of Science Programmes at ICSU, moderated the event. Anne-Sophie Stevance, lead coordinator of the review at ICSU introduced the report, its methodology and key findings highlighting the importance of the report as a tool for strengthening the targets as well as the broader contributions that science can play in building a robust and evidence-based Post-2015 Agenda.</p> <p>Claudia Ringler from the International Food Policy Research Institute reflected on the interconnected nature of the SDGs, and in particular SDG 2 on tackling hunger, food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture, which will require contributions from other goals and targets during implementation and monitoring. She also highlighted the importance of identifying and managing critical synergies and trade-offs across the SDG framework, especially with goals such as climate change or water and sanitation.</p> <p>Berta Mart\\ufffd\\ufffdn-L\\ufffd\\ufffdpez illustrated how social and natural systems interplay from local to the global scale and discussed the need for a multi-scale approach to successfully deliver the SDGs, and in particular for the preservation, restoration and promotion of the sustainable use and management of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems at local, regional and global scales.</p> <p>Susan Parnell, from the African Center for Cities and University of Cape Town, emphasised the importance of the cities as a key implementation scale of sustainable development, and where innovations and transformative actions can be nurtured.</p> <p>Finally, Michelle Scobie from the University of West Indies addressed key requirements to embed the SDGs in national policies with a particular focus on Small Island Developing States. Governance and institutional arrangements will be key to translate global goals into locally-relevant priorities and action. This will require facilitating processes for better governance including through the participation of non-state actors, capacity building and knowledge-sharing.</p> <p>Discussion from the floor raised a number of questions including on the engagement of the scientific community with the process to define indicators for the SDGs and in particular work undertaken on integrated indicators that could help better the interconnected nature of the SDGs.</p> <p>The report was covered in <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/702.full\">Science</a> (paywall), <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.scidev.net/global/mdgs/news/un-pitfalls-vague-sdg-targets.html\">SciDevNet</a>, <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://tmsnrt.rs/1zcJfAA\">Reuters AlertNet</a> and the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://wef.ch/1E7ip0b\">World Economic Forum blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-02T11:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/international-symposium-on-science-assessment-and-research-integrity\">     <title>International symposium on science assessment and research integrity</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/international-symposium-on-science-assessment-and-research-integrity</link>     <description>Through its Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS), the International Council for Science is engaged in the promotion of a responsible conduct of science.

However, of the 169 targets beneath the 17 draft goals, just 29% are well defined and based on the latest scientific evidence, while 54% need more work and 17% are weak or non-essential.</p> <p>Many of the targets suffer from a lack of integration, some repetition and rely too much on vague, qualitative language rather than hard, measurable, time-bound, quantitative targets, the report finds.</p> <p>Authors are also concerned the goals are presented in \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsilos.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The goals address challenges such as climate, food security and health in isolation from one another. Without interlinking there is a danger of conflict between different goals, most notably trade-offs between overcoming poverty and moving towards sustainability. Action to meet one target could have unintended consequences on others if they are pursued separately.</p> <p>Finally, the report highlights the need for an \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdend-goal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to provide a big picture vision for the SDGs. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdultimate end\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of the SDGs in combination is not clear, nor is how the proposed goals and targets would contribute to achieve that ultimate end,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd write the authors.

This is a core activity of its <a href=\"../../freedom-responsibility/freedom-responsibility-portal\">Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS)</a>, whose actions are bolstered by a number of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../../freedom-responsibility/science_human_rights/human-rights-texts\">international legal texts that proclaim various rights of scientists</a>.</p> <p>In living up to the Committee\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds mission, and within a week before today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds<a href=\"#_msocom_1\"></a> <a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/AboutUs/Pages/HumanRightsDay.aspx\">UN Human Rights Day</a>, its Chair attended a court hearing in Turkey against some 200 people, including the scientist B\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdra Ersanl\\ufffd\\ufffd. CFRS had monitored her situation since she was first imprisoned. Ersanl\\ufffd\\ufffd, a faculty member in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Marmara University in Istanbul, was arrested in October 2011 as part of a crackdown on Kurdish political parties. She was charged with suspected links to the Kurdistan Workers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Party (PKK). Ersanl\\ufffd\\ufffd was in fact a member of the Assembly of the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP), and she never advocated violence. Rather, her case and that of other scientists that CFRS considered, seemed to confirm an increased politicisation of science and political pressure on scientists in Turkey, such as <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/turkey-cracks-down-on-academic-freedom-1.10942?nc=1376951622024\"><i>Nature</i></a> and <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6144/332.1\"><i>Science</i></a> suggested at the time and later.</p> <p>CFRS wrote to the Turkish authorities expressing concern, and asked for her unconditional release on bail or for further information on the causes of her imprisonment. In July 2012, she was released, pending the outcome of the trial. Sydnes met Ersanl\\ufffd\\ufffd in August 2013 in Istanbul to discuss her case and to confirm the Committee\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds continued support. Initially scheduled for late 2013 or early 2014, the trial took place a fortnight ago. Although no final verdict was taken and the court deferred the cases to the Constitutional Court in Ankara, Ersanl\\ufffd\\ufffd says the presence of Leiv Sydnes in the courtroom as a foreign witness \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmade a difference.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd CFRS will continue to monitor the case of Ersanl\\ufffd\\ufffd and intervene as appropriate.</p> <p>See also <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.bianet.org/english/science/160411-international-observer-speaks-up-on-busra-ersanli-s-trial\">the interview by the CFRS Chair with the Turkish internet daily <i>Bianet.</i></a></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-12-10T10:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/international-council-for-science-announces-dr.-heide-hackmann-to-be-executive-director-and-dr.-lucilla-spini-head-of-science-programmes\">     <title>International Council for Science announces Dr. Heide Hackmann to be Executive Director and Dr. Lucilla Spini, Head of Science Programmes</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/international-council-for-science-announces-dr.-heide-hackmann-to-be-executive-director-and-dr.-lucilla-spini-head-of-science-programmes</link>     <description>Heide Hackmann, a social scientist with extensive experience running international research organizations, will be Executive Director of the Council\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Secretariat from March 2015.

It mobilizes the knowledge and resources of the international scientific community to strengthen international science for the benefit of society.</p> <p>www.icsu.org</p> <p><b>MEDIA ENQUIRIES</b></p> <p>Denise Young, Head of Communications, International Council for Science \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd denise.young@icsu.org</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-12-08T08:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/more-than-1000-delegates-gather-in-geneva-to-finalize-UN-disaster-risk-framework\">     <title>More than 1,000 delegates gather in Geneva for talks on global disaster risk reduction agreement </title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/more-than-1000-delegates-gather-in-geneva-to-finalize-UN-disaster-risk-framework</link>     <description>ICSU took part in the second preparatory session for the Third World Disaster Risk Reduction Conference at the UN in Geneva from Nov 17-18. As the organizing partner of the Science and Technology Major Group, ICSU convened a delegation of more than 20 representatives from Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa drawn from research organizations, ICSU's IRDR programme and ICSU's Regional Offices and partner organizations such as the IAP.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The aim of the two-day meeting was to negotiate the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.wcdrr.org/preparatory/post2015\">zero draft\\ufffd\\ufffdof the Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction</a> that will be approved at the WCDRR in Sendai, Japan in March 2015. Progress was made - including via an overnight session where member states provided line by line comments on the zero draft - but will be continued in December 2014 and January 2015 before the framework can be finalized.</p> <p>The Science and Technology Major Group <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.wcdrr.org/preparatory/prepcom2/statementslist\">made a series of inputs</a><a href=\"http://www.wcdrr.org/preparatory/prepcom2/statementslist\"></a> via statements in the technical workshops and co-chairs dialogue on issues ranging from the contribution that science can make in the implementation of the Framework, the links between the post-2015 agenda and DRR and the integration of DRR with financing.</p> <p>While member states recognized the importance of science for disaster risk reduction, there was agreement that many countries struggle to connect science with decision-makers at the national and local levels.</p> <p>The Science and Technology Major Group urged delegates to address this challenge by supporting a broad partnership between science and policymakers to implement evidence-based decision-making on disaster risk reduction.</p> <p>Such a partnership would help to strengthen the provision of actionable research co-designed and co-produced with stakeholders, assess and synthesize scientific evidence that can support the work of policy-makers and practitioners, help develop methodologies, standards, metrics to monitor progress on DRR and resilience building.</p> <p>Science also has a key role to play in improving our understanding of underlying risk factors. In a statement, the Science and Technology Major Group urged delegates to recognize that disasters are not caused by natural hazards but triggered by them.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRisk is built into the development process, so corrective and prospective measures and actions are needed once we know the underlying factors,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd said Virgina Jimenez Diaz, representing the ICSU Regional Office for Latin America.</p> <p>Schuaib Lwasa, member of the IRDR Scientific Committee from Makerere University in Uganda, said that the Science and Technology Major Group was ready to implement the following voluntary commitments:</p> <ul> <li>Build closer partnerships and better communication to enhance the use of scientific knowledge for evidence-based decision-making at all levels of government;</li> <li>Engage to help strengthen capacity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbuilding and to advance risk literacy through curricular reform, in professional training and by life-long learning across all sectors of society;</li> <li>Offer analytical tools to assess and advance our knowledge of underlying risk drivers for more effective monitoring and review, across sectors of society);</li> <li>Offer advisory capabilities across all fields of science, technology and innovation to address, jointly with communities, stakeholders and governments issues that are relevant to them;</li> <li>Propose models for co-design of research that will involve all relevant actors (but which will also require new forms of funding and academic reward systems).</li> </ul> <p>On integrating disaster risk reduction into the post-2015 development agenda, the Science and Technology Major Group noted that the zero draft of the Sustainable Development Goals included several universal targets that cover disaster risk. Goals 1, 2, 3, 11, 13 and sub-targets associated with means of implementation would benefit from disaster risk reduction science.</p> <p>Details of the timeline for completing the zero draft <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.wcdrr.org/preparatory/prepcom2\">are available online</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-11-19T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>      </rdf:RDF> ",
