Turtle body size ranged from 51-95cm CCL, and all turtles had been stranded along the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula, Mexico at Playa San Lazaro. The number of annual growth layers sampled from each turtle humerus bone ranged from 2-11, with a total of 92 annual growth layers sampled. Applying measurements from skeletochronology, back-calculated body sizes corresponding to individual growth layers ranged from 32-95cm CCL, with both carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values being significantly different for turtle body sizes below and above 40cm CCL (?15N p=0.035; ?13C p=0.013), indicating differences in habitat and or diet between smaller and larger turtles. For all annual bone layers sampled, median stable nitrogen isotope value (?15N) was 16.02?, and ranged from 10.52-20.52?; median stable carbon isotope value (?13C) was -15.52?, and ranged from -21.29-12.87?. However, unlike loggerheads where a habitat shift is readily identified by changes in isotope values, especially in nitrogen, the patterns in isotope values of green turtles appear to be more complex. These findings warrant continued sampling of green turtles for bone stable isotope analysis, in order to better elucidate the complex life history patterns and identify habitat use shifts of this population of turtles.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21738\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Determine sex ratios of green turtles along the U.S. West Coast through examinations of hormones</title>          <abstract>A testosterone (T) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was validated for use with green turtle plasma in order to determine the sex of juvenile turtles.  We also compared T results on the same samples obtained from both RIA (radio-immunoassay) and ELISA techniques and found that the ELISA demonstrated excellent correspondence to the RIA for providing testosterone concentrations for sex determination. Between 1990 and 2013, 115 individual juvenile and adult green sea turtles were caught in San Diego Bay (SDB). Out of the 115 individual turtles captured throughout the study period, 61 (53%) had plasma samples archived.  Using plasma testosterone concentrations we found that the SDB population was female biased (3.1F:1M), but when examining only the juveniles the sex ratio was greater at 4.6F:1M. Sex ratio assessment at the San Gabriel River location is ongoing as the number of samples collected (at present n = 7) from that population is limited and, therefore, we cannot provide a robust analysis of sex ratio of that population until additional samples are collected.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"12736\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Determining sex ratios of turtle hatchlings</title>          <abstract>Previous status assessments of marine turtles have assumed that the natural sex ratio of a marine turtle population is 1:1 (e.g. Conant et al. 2009). However, this is largely speculative and is based on few data, a troubling fact considering the importance of sex ratios when modeling the status of marine turtle populations. Marine turtles exhibit temperature sex determination (TSD), such that the overall sex ratio of hatchlings produced on a nesting beach is affected by the incubation temperatures on that beach (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980, Rimblot et al. 1985). This creates unique susceptibility of marine turtles to global climate change and deforestation at nesting beaches (Hawkes et al. 2007). And although research has shown that the temperature threshold may vary among species and beaches, there are relatively few studies on hatchling sex ratios (Chevalier et al. 1999, Wibbels 2003, Mrosovsky et al. 2009). Considering the extreme importance of knowing sex ratio when modeling population abundance and trends, it is essential to conduct studies to determine sex ratio at various nesting beaches. In this study, we proposed to monitor thermal environments at the St. Croix, USVI, leatherback turtle nesting beach and the Bahia de Jiquilisco-Xiriualtique Biosphere Reserve in El Salvador for hawksbill turtles.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21809\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Development of quantitative tools for assessing effects of anthropogenic mortality for marine turtle populations</title>          <abstract/>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21741\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Establish nesting beach origins for all turtles in CA via genetic techniques</title>          <abstract>To examine the stock origin and evaluate current life-history hypotheses of green turtles foraging in southern California, 780 bp of the mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region was sequenced from 119 juvenile and adult green turtles from the southern California foraging sites, San Diego Bay and San Gabriel River.  The sequences were compared to potential green turtle source populations across the Pacific. Eighteen haplotypes were observed and preliminary analyses indicate that green turtles foraging along southern California originate from eastern Pacific nesting stocks, mainly Mexico. However, three juveniles (1 in San Diego Bay and 2 in San Gabriel) captured in 2013 exhibited new haplotypes not described at any of the rookeries sampled to date, indicating a potential shift or expansion of new recruits feeding into the southern California foraging areas from less traditional or un-sampled eastern Pacific nesting stocks.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21737\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Estimation of survival rates and abundance of green turtles along the U.S. West Coast</title>          <abstract>To determine abundance and survival rates of the east Pacific green turtles in the northern most foraging grounds, the turtle research groups at SWFSC have been  conducting the capture-mark-recapture study for over 20 years. Estimates of these parameters for 1990-2009 were provided in a paper in 2010 (Eguchi et al. 2010 Herpetologica). We continue to conduct the capture-mark-recapture study to improve and update the estimates. Since April 2013, 9 field trips were made to San Diego Bay and 13 green turtles were caught, of which six were captured  for the first time. Since March 2013, five trips were made to the Long Beach area and 12 green turtles were caught, all of which were captured for the first time. We plan to use these data in the future to estimate survival rates and abundances at these foraging areas. Combined with the hormone analysis, which also was supported through this funding, we will attempt to estimate sex-specific survival rates for these northern most and industrialized foraging areas.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21745\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>FY 11 Determination of hatchling sex ratios</title>          <abstract>During the nesting season in 2012, temperature loggers (HOBO U22) were deployed in 42 nests (20 relocated and 22 in situ nests, of which 39 were retrieved).  Temperature loggers (n = 55) also were placed on the beach at 50 cm from the surface, corresponding to the approximate depth of a next.  Of the 55 loggers, 23 were retrieved but 32 were lost due to unexpected beach erosion during this season. Eighty eight nests have been excavated and naturally deceased hatchlings and unhatched embryos (n = 487) collected.  This sample size was approximately five times more than expected. Gonad samples are preserved in formalin and were shipped to Florida Atlantic University at the end of the season for anatomical and histological examinations.  As of late April 2013, 101 samples have been histologically examined. Of these 101 samples, the sex of 12 could not be determined because of advanced decomposition.  For the remainder, 11 (12%) were male and 78 (88%) were female, indicating female-skewed sex ratio at this nesting beach.  Histological examinations are underway to determine the remainder of the samples. Although the thermal profile of the nesting beach for this year has not been created, a similar project was conducted in the previous years by a graduate student (Emily Weston) of Jeanette Wyneken (TE is a committee member).</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21744\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>FY 11 Oxytetracycline injections for future skeletochronology validation</title>          <abstract>This portion of the FY11 proposal was additionally funded by SAIP in FY2013 and the results below reflect the entire study duration encompassed by both awards. To provide samples for validating skeletochronology, we have been injecting the antibiotic tetracycline to green turtles captured in the southern California. Oxytetracycline marks the bones of the animal at the time of injection so they can be used in future aging studies if the animal strands dead. One dose administered prior to skin biopsy and tagging could offer the same beneficial prophylactic effects as presurgical antibiotics may offer in preventing post-surgical infections as well (SEFSC Field manual). During this funding period, a total of 14 green turtles were injected with oxytetracycline (8 at Long Beach and 6 at San Diego study areas). The sizes of these turtles ranged from 19 kg (SCL = 51.9 cm) to 123 kg (SCL = 90.0 cm). To date, we have not found a carcass of a green turtle that had been treated with oxytetracycline. As more turtles are treated at both locations, we will have greater probability of finding a carcass of an animal that has been injected with oxytetracycline.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"21743\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>FY 11 Use of stable isotope analysis to determine of the timing of ontogenic habitat shifts</title>          <abstract>SAIP funding for stable isotope research was provided in FY11 and FY13; the FY11 funding was for loggerhead turtles (described below) as opposed to green turtles in FY13. A total of 35 humerus bones from North Pacific loggerheads have been collected from turtles stranded at Playa San Lazaro on the west coast of Baja California Peninsula, Mexico. Turtle body size ranged from 45-88cm CCL. These bones have been processed for skeletochronology, and bone annual growth layers have been sequentially sampled for stable isotope analysis of both carbon and nitrogen. Over 200 individual annual growth layers have been sampled, with 4 - 9 annual layers being sampled per bone. For all annual bone layers sampled, median stable nitrogen value (d15N) was 14.82 permil and ranged from 9.86-20.55 permil; median stable carbon value (d13C) was -16.39 permil and values ranged from -21.05 to -14.20 permil.  While analysis is still underway, trends show an increase in stable nitrogen values with increasing turtle body size. This trend provides evidence of a habitat shift from a low-nitrogen oceanic habitat, to a higher-nitrogen nearshore habitat. Nitrogen and carbon isotope values of annual growth layers with corresponding body size less than 45cm CCL are significantly lower than the isotope values of growth layers corresponding to body sizes greater than 45cm CCL (d15N p&lt;0.0001; d13C p = 0.004). The timing of this shift in habitat use corresponds with previous demographic size-class distribution data of this population, and additional funding has been sought to further understand the timing and implications of habitat use.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"17877\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Green Turtle Trophic Ecology</title>          <abstract>SWFSC is currently conducting a study of green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas) trophic ecology in the eastern Pacific. Tissue samples and stable carbon and stable nitrogen isotope data are available for ca. 400 green turtles distributed among 14 neritic foraging areas stretching from San Diego Bay, CA, to Pisco, Peru.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"12738\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Initiating age-validation study for green turtles</title>          <abstract>Population models and evaluation of trends, threats, and extinction risk require the best possible regional estimates of vital rates (averages and annual variation) and are enhanced by understanding of environmental mechanisms that drive these rates. Analyzing the vital rates of marine turtles within U.S. coastal waters is much needed if our Agency is to meet the goals set forth in the NRC Report. In conducting informal or formal ESA consultations, NMFS is required to use the best available scientific or commercial data, which may include published or unpublished data. Often critical to the jeopardy analysis later in the biological opinion are information on vital rates, as targeted in this proposal. Such information may be used in quantitative analyses of population trends and better quality and increased data will lead to less uncertainty for the agency when reaching its final conclusions. As of June 27, 2012, 10 green turtles have been injected with oxytetracycline at two foraging grounds along the southern California coast.  Straight carapace lengths of these turtles ranged from 64.2 cm to 103.4 cm (Table 1).  San Gabriel River and Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge are considered one foraging area because of a recapture of a green turtle in the wildlife refuge that was previously caught in San Gabriel River.  Because these foraging grounds are located in urbanized and populated area, we expect to have high probability of recovering carcasses if these turtles die in the areas.   </abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"17914\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Leatherback Isotopes</title>          <abstract>SWFSC is currently working on a project identifying global marine isotopes using leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) as the indicator species.

Oxytetracycline marks the bones of the animal at the time of injection so they can be used in future aging studies if the animal strands dead. One dose administered prior to skin biopsy and tagging could offer the same beneficial prophylactic effects as presurgical antibiotics may offer in preventing post-surgical infections as well (SEFSC Field manual). During this funding period, a total of 14 green turtles were injected with oxytetracycline (8 at Long Beach and 6 at San Diego study areas). The sizes of these turtles ranged from 19 kg (SCL = 51.9 cm) to 123 kg (SCL = 90.0 cm). To date, we have not found a carcass of a green turtle that had been treated with oxytetracycline. As more turtles are treated at both locations, we will have greater probability of finding a carcass of an animal that has been injected with oxytetracycline.</abstract>       </item>    </related-items>    <fgdc-contacts>       <fgdc-contact role=\"Metadata contact\">          <contact-type>cntper</contact-type>          <contact-person-name>Prosperi, Dan L</contact-person-name>          <contact-org-name>Southwest Fisheries Science Center</contact-org-name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, Room 257</street-address>          <city>La Jolla</city>          <state-prov>CA</state-prov>          <zip>92037</zip>          <country>USA</country>          <email>Dan.Prosperi@noaa.gov</email>          <voice>858-546-5667</voice>          <fax>858-546-7003</fax>          <org-business-hours>M-F 8:00 - 17:00</org-business-hours>          <instructions>Contact via email</instructions>       </fgdc-contact>       <fgdc-contact role=\"Point of Contact\">          <contact-type>cntper</contact-type>          <contact-person-name>Seminoff, Jeffrey A</contact-person-name>          <contact-org-name>Southwest Fisheries Science Center</contact-org-name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>8901 La Jolla Shores Dr</street-address>          <city>La Jolla</city>          <state-prov>CA</state-prov>          <zip>92037</zip>          <country>USA</country>          <email>jeffrey.seminoff@noaa.gov</email>          <voice>(858) 546-7152</voice>          <fax>(858) 546-7003</fax>          <org-business-hours>M-F 8:00 -16:30</org-business-hours>          <instructions>Contact via email</instructions>       </fgdc-contact>    </fgdc-contacts>    <fgdc-time-period>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>1980</begdate>                <begtime/>                <enddate>Present</enddate>                <endtime/>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current/>       </timeperd>    </fgdc-time-period>    <publisher>       <person-contact-info>          <name>Jackson, Alan R</name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, Room 221</street-address>          <city>La Jolla</city>          <state-prov>CA</state-prov>          <zip>92037</zip>          <country>USA</country>          <email>al.jackson@noaa.gov</email>          <phone>(858) 546-7048</phone>          <fax>(858) 546-7003</fax>       </person-contact-info>    </publisher> </catalog-item> ",
