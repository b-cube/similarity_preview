Potential runoff&#45;contributing areas were estimated collectively for the processes of infiltration&#45;excess overland flow and saturation&#45;excess overland flow. For infiltration&#45;excess overland flow, various rainfall&#45;intensity and soil&#45;permeability values were used. For saturation&#45;excess overland flow, antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions and a topographic wetness index were used. The digital data sets used in the analysis included 1:24,000&#45;scale soils data (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1996) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 100&#45;meter&#45;resolution digital elevation model (DEM) (U.S. Geological Survey, 1993). The data set of potential runoff&#45;contributing areas is in grid (raster) format with a grid&#45;cell size of 10,000 square meters.</abstract>    <purpose> This digital spatial data set was developed with the objective being to improve statewide ability to distinguish drainage basins and subbasin areas as having relatively high or low potential for runoff. Thus, this data set is intended for use in comparing areas in terms of relative, rather than absolute, potential runoff. This data set is not intended to be used for the purpose of inferring the magnitude of potential runoff in a given area.  The data set is intended for use in regional analyses involving areas tens of square kilometers in size or larger (for example, drainage basins). It is not intended, nor should it be used, for site&#45;specific analyses. </purpose>    <supplinf> The potential runoff&#45;contributing areas determined may over&#45; or under&#45;estimate actual contributing areas for a particular location and precipitation event. A variety of factors may account for the difference between potential and actual contributing areas including vegetation (type and density), soil compaction, best management practices, impervious surfaces, land use, and climatic variability. Such factors were not addressed in the development of this data set.  This digital spatial data set was created using the ArcInfo geographic information system (GIS) software package (version 7.2.1).  Two data sources provided the necessary information. The original source of the 1:24,000&#45;scale soil cartographic and attribute information for this data set was the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1996). The soil&#45;polygon information on the spatial distribution of the various soils in Kansas was obtained from the Kansas GIS Data Access and Support Center (http://gisdasc.kgs.ukans.edu) in Lawrence, Kansas. The digital maps of soil polygons were tiled by 7.5&#45;minute (1:24,000&#45;scale) USGS topographic quadrangles. About 1,600 quadrangles were required to cover Kansas. The digital maps were obtained on compact disk (CD) as ArcInfo export&#45;format files.  Soil&#45;attribute information, available by county, was obtained from the NRCS in Salina, Kansas. The soil&#45;attribute information was obtained as an ASCII file. There are 105 counties in Kansas.  The soils data were used to create a statewide grid of depth&#45;weighted, mean soil permeability for Kansas (See Process_Step section for complete explanation).  The soil cartographic and attribute information used to create this data set is currently being used by NRCS to create a certified version of the 1:24,000&#45;scale soil survey geographic (SSURGO) data base for Kansas. The quality of the soil data used to create this data set is the same as the quality of the soil data in the certified SSURGO data base (P.R. Finnell, Natural Resources Conservation Service, written commun., 2000).  The USGS 100&#45;meter&#45;resolution DEM (U.S. Geological Survey, 1993) data were obtained from a USGS web site (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). The DEM's are tiled by USGS 1:250,000&#45;scale topographic maps. A total of 15 DEM's were required to cover Kansas. The individual DEM's were converted into GIS grids that then were merged into one statewide grid of elevation data for Kansas. The statewide grid of elevation data was used to create a statewide grid of topographic wetness index (TWI) data (See Process_Step section for complete explanation).  The following reference provided the technique for estimating the TWI from the DEM&#45;derived elevation data.

The first input grid was depth&#45;weighted, mean soil permeability, which was created from 1:24,000&#45;scale soils digital data (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1996). The second input grid was topography, which was assembled from available USGS DEM data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1993).  Using these input grids, an analysis was performed (See Process_Step section) to estimate potential runoff&#45;contributing areas on a cell&#45;by&#45;cell basis for the state. The resulting grid consists of a binary classification in which potential runoff&#45;contributing grid cells are assigned a value of 1 and potential noncontributing grid cells are assigned a value of 0. The absolute accuracy of the binary classification is unknown due to the uncertain accuracy of the input data sets. However, the classification was repeated by Dave Wolock (USGS, Lawrence, Kansas) and overlaid on the original result to verify that the classification worked correctly. </attraccr>   </attracc>   <logic>Not applicable for raster (grid) data.</logic>   <complete>This digital spatial data set provides a complete grid representation of potential runoff&#45;contributing areas for Kansas.</complete>   <posacc>    <horizpa>     <horizpar> The horizontal accuracy of the grid of potential runoff&#45;contributing areas for Kansas is unknown. It is related to the horizontal accuracy of the two input grids.  The input grid of depth&#45;weighted, mean soil permeability was created from 1:24,000&#45;scale soils digital data (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1996). Due to the inherently fuzzy nature of the boundaries between adjacent soil types in the landscape, the estimated placement of the boundaries between soil types, and the error introduced during the original digitization of the soil&#45;polygon maps and subsequent conversion to a grid format, the horizontal accuracy of this data set is unknown.  It is known that NRCS verified that the digital source maps were an accurate representation of the published or revised paper soil surveys. It is also known that the digital source data were compiled to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards.  The input grid of elevation data was created from USGS 100&#45;meter&#45;resolution DEM's (U.S. Geological Survey, 1993). The DEM's were created mostly from USGS 1:250,000&#45;scale topographic maps. Additional information on the accuracy of the DEM's is available at the USGS National Mapping Program Standards web site (http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/index.html). </horizpar>    </horizpa>   </posacc>   <lineage>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service</origin>       <pubdate>1996</pubdate>       <title>Detailed soils</title>       <geoform>Map</geoform>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <srcscale>24,000</srcscale>     <typesrc>digital data (ArcInfo coverages)</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <rngdates>        <begdate>1965</begdate>        <enddate>1995</enddate>       </rngdates>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>Currentness varies depending on when a particular county soil survey was originally published and whether or not it was subsequently revised.

All processing was done using ArcInfo GIS software (version 7.2.1).  Potential contributing areas of infiltration&#45;excess overland flow were determined by the interaction of rainfall intensity and soil permeability. The least permeable soils in a basin are the most likely to contribute infiltration&#45;excess overland flow. As rainfall intensity increases, areas with more moderate permeability also may contribute overland flow.  The potential for infiltration&#45;excess overland flow was estimated using a grid of depth&#45;weighted, mean soil permeability. The grid has a grid&#45;cell size of 100 by 100 meters (or 10,000 square meters).  The following paragraphs describe how the depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability grid was created.  The process involved the conversion of about 1,600 digital soil&#45;polygon maps, with associated depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability data, into one digital map in grid format.  The approximately 1,600 digital soil&#45;polygon maps (that is, ArcInfo coverages) were obtained on CD from the Kansas GIS Data Access and Support Center as ArcInfo export files. These digital maps are in the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection (zones 14 and 15). The horizontal datum for these digital maps is the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27).  The digital maps were imported (IMPORT algorithm) and then appended (APPEND algorithm) in blocks to produce 12 large digital maps that cover the state. Ten of the resulting digital maps were in UTM zone 14, with the remaining two digital maps in UTM zone 15. The 12 digital maps were processed (CLEAN algorithm) to restore the polygon topology.  The 12 digital maps then were checked to verify that each soil polygon had a valid mapping unit identification (MUID) assigned to it. Soil polygons with no MUID were populated with the correct MUID by reference to the published paper soil&#45;survey map for that soil polygon. Also, all the MUID's were checked and edited as necessary to make sure they all had upper&#45;case letters only (in many cases the second letter in the MUID was lower case). Because ArcInfo is case sensitive, it was essential that all the MUID's contained only upper&#45;case letters so that the depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability attribute data could be joined successfully to the digital soil&#45;polygon maps.  The soil&#45;permeability data were obtained as an ASCII file from the NRCS in Salina, Kansas. The file included, for each unique MUID, the thickness and mean permeability for each of the component soil layers as well as the percentage of the soil map unit represented by the component soil layer.  A Fortran program was used to compute the depth&#45;weighted, mean soil permeability for each MUID. For each soil map unit (that is, for each MUID), the thickness and average soil permeability were multiplied for each component soil layer. The results for all component soil layers then were summed and divided by the total soil thickness to determine the depth&#45;weighted, mean soil permeability for each soil map unit. For soil map units that consisted of multiple components, the percentage of each component was used to weight the final mean soil permeability accordingly.  The resultant file then was used as the input to create an ArcInfo data file (that is, an INFO table) of the depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability data. The depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability data were joined (JOINITEM algorithm) to the 12 digital maps using the MUID as the relational key item.  The resulting 12 digital maps then were checked. Each digital map was displayed, and about 10 soil polygons were randomly selected to verify that they had the correct MUID and depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability value. All soil polygons with a mean permeability of 0 also were checked. In some cases, the value of 0 indicated an area for which no information was available. Examples include water bodies, quarries, and borrow pits. For water bodies (streams and lakes) a value of 0 is acceptable because most of the rain that falls on a water body becomes part of the runoff. For quarries, borrow pits, and other areas of no imformation, the value of 0 may or may not be representative. However, because such areas are typically small, scattered, and only account for about 0.08 percent of the area of the state, they are not considered significant.  In other cases, the value of 0 was incorrect and due to an error in the MUID. Usually, the problem MUID's were an isolated occurrence involving only one or two soil polygons. However, in a few instances, large numbers of soil polygons were involved. In Morton County, some \"129..\" MUID codes were entered as \"192..\". In Saline County, 286 soil polygons had an MUID with a county code of \"168\" instead of \"169.\" In Barton County, 84 soil polygons had an MUID of \"099HR\" instead of \"009HR.\" In Cowley County, 78 soil polygons had an MUID of \"035CD\" instead of \"035CC.\" All of these errors were corrected.  The 12 attributed digital maps then were reprojected (PROJECT algorithm) from UTM to an Albers Conical Equal Area projection. The horizontal datum for these reprojected digital maps is the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The reprojected digital maps were processed (CLEAN algorithm) to restore the polygon topology.  The 12 digital maps were converted from polygon to grid format (POLYGRID algorithm) with a grid&#45;cell size of 30 by 30 meters (or 900 square meters). The depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability values then were multiplied by 100 to convert the values from real to integer numbers. The conversion to integer values was done to reduce the size of the grids. Thus, the grids provide the depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability values in units of hundredths of an inch per hour (instead of inches per hour).  The resultant 12 integer grids then were merged (MERGE algorithm) into one statewide grid of depth&#45;weighted, mean soil&#45;permeability for Kansas.  To reduce the size of the grid, it was resampled (RESAMPLE algorithm using a bilinear interpolation) with a grid&#45;cell size of 100 by 100 meters (or 10,000 square meters).  The following paragraphs decribe how the grids of potential runoff&#45;contributing areas were created. Included is a description of how the grid of TWI data was created.  An equal&#45;interval approach was used to select six threshold soil&#45;permeability values that represent the rainfall intensity at which infiltration&#45;excess overland flow would occur. In Kansas, soil permeability ranges from 0 to 17.6 in/hr (inches per hour). However, because about 93 percent of the state has a soil permeability of 4.0 in/hr or less, the effective range used in this study was 0 to 4.0 in/hr. Thus, the threshold soil&#45;permeability values, representing very high, high, moderate, low, very low, and extremely low rainfall intensity, were set at 3.43, 2.86, 2.29, 1.71, 1.14, and 0.57 in/hr, respectively. In general, the lower rainfall intensities occur more frequently than the higher rainfall intensities. The higher soil&#45;permeability thresholds imply a more intense storm during which areas with higher soil permeability potentially may contribute infiltration&#45;excess overland flow.  Potential contributing areas of saturation&#45;excess overland flow were determined by the interaction of basin topography and antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions. The effect of topography on saturation&#45;excess overland flow can be quantified by an index called the topographic wetness index (TWI) (Wolock and McCabe, 1995). The TWI is computed as ln(a/S) for all points in a basin, where \"ln\" is the natural logarithm, \"a\" is the upslope area per unit contour length, and \"S\" is the slope at that point. The locations in a basin with the highest TWI values (large upslope areas and gentle slopes) are the most likely to contribute saturation&#45;excess overland flow. When antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions are dry, only areas with the highest TWI values may be saturated and potentially contribute overland flow. When antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions are wet, areas with lower TWI values may be saturated and potentially contribute overland flow.  The potential for saturation&#45;excess overland flow was estimated using DEM&#45;derived TWI digital data. The USGS 100&#45;meter&#45;resolution DEM (U.S. Geological Survey, 1993) data were obtained from a a USGS web site (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). The DEM's are tiled by USGS 1:250,000&#45;scale topographic maps. A total of 15 DEM's were required to cover Kansas. The individual DEM's were converted into GIS grids that then were merged into one statewide grid of elevation data for Kansas. The statewide grid of elevation data was used to create a statewide grid of TWI data as described below.  In general, there is a direct relation between TWI and the potential for saturation&#45;excess overland flow. Derivation of the TWI digital data followed an approach described by Wolock and McCabe (1995). Elevation differences among the grid cells in the DEM&#45;derived elevation grid were compared and used to create a flow&#45;direction grid. The flow&#45;direction grid was used to derive a flow&#45;accumulation grid by computing the number of upslope cells that drain into each cell. The upslope area per unit contour length (a) for each cell in the flow&#45;accumulation grid was computed as shown below.  a = (number of upslope cells + 0.5) x (grid&#45;cell length).  Using the elevation grid and the flow&#45;direction grid, the magnitude of the slope (S) was computed for each cell as shown below.  S = (change in elevation between neighboring grid cells)/ (horizontal distance between centers of neighboring grid cells).  The resultant slope (gradient) grid then was used in combination with the flow&#45;accumulation grid to compute TWI for each cell as TWI = ln (a / S). Using this technique, a statewide grid of TWI data was created.  An equal&#45;interval approach was used to select six threshold TWI values that represent a range of wet&#45;to&#45;dry antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions. For this analysis, the TWI grid cells that represent the streams were excluded since the TWI is considered a characteristic of the land surface that contributes runoff to the streams. In Kansas, the TWI (with grid cells representing the streams excluded) ranges from 4.5 to 18.3. Because the TWI had a normal distribution, the full range of values was used. Thus, the threshold TWI values, representing very wet, wet, moderate, dry, very dry, and extremely dry antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions, were set at 6.5, 8.4, 10.4, 12.4, 14.4, and 16.3, respectively. The lower TWI thresholds imply wetter antecedent soil&#45;moisture conditions during which areas with lower TWI values potentially may contribute saturation&#45;excess overland flow.  The combined potential for runoff in Kansas due to infiltration&#45;excess overland flow and saturation&#45;excess overland flow was estimated by merging the previously described hypothetical conditions. A very high potential&#45;runoff condition was created by combining very high rainfall intensity (soil permeability less than or equal to 3.43 in/hr) with very wet antecedent soil&#45;moisture (TWI greater than or equal to 6.5) conditions. A high potential&#45;runoff condition was created by combining high rainfall intensity (soil permeability less than or equal to 2.86 in/hr) with wet antecedent soil&#45;moisture (TWI greater than or equal to 8.4) conditions. A moderate potential&#45;runoff condition was created by combining moderate rainfall intensity (soil permeability less than or equal to 2.29 in/hr) with moderate antecedent soil&#45;moisture (TWI greater than or equal to 10.4) conditions.  A low potential&#45;runoff condition was created by combining the low rainfall intensity (soil permeability less than or equal to 1.71 in/hr) with dry antecedent soil&#45;moisture (TWI greater than or equal to 12.4) conditions. A very low potential&#45;runoff condition was created by combining the very low rainfall intensity (soil permeability less than or equal to 1.14 in/hr) with very dry antecedent soil&#45;moisture (TWI greater than or equal to 14.4) conditions. An extremely low potential&#45;runoff condition was created by combining the extremely low rainfall intensity (soil permeability less than or equal to 0.57 in/hr) with extremely dry antecedent soil&#45;moisture (TWI greater than or equal to 16.3) conditions.  A statewide grid of potential runoff&#45;contributing areas was created for each of the six sets of environmental conditions. For each grid, the grid cells satisfying the threshold conditions were assigned a value of 1 (potential contributing area), and the remaining grid cells were assigned a value of 0 (potential noncontributing area).  A comparison of the six resultant grids indicated that the very low potential&#45;runoff condition provided the best statewide ability to distinguish areas as having relatively high or low potential for runoff. This determination was made on the basis of the percentage of potential runoff&#45;contributing areas within selected drainage basins throughout the state. The grid representing the very low potential&#45;runoff condition is the grid provided with this metadata. </procdesc>     <procdate>1999</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>First draft of metadata created by kjuracek using FGDCMETA.AML ver. 1.33 07/15/99 on ARC/INFO data set h:\\\\kjuracek\\\\ks_100mcon</procdesc>     <procdate>20000208</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep><procdesc Sync=\"TRUE\">Metadata imported.</procdesc><srcused Sync=\"TRUE\">C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\battles\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\xml14AA.tmp</srcused><date Sync=\"TRUE\">20040413</date><time Sync=\"TRUE\">15481200</time></procstep></lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>   <direct>Raster</direct>   <rastinfo>    <rasttype>Grid Cell</rasttype>    <rowcount>3530</rowcount>    <colcount>6542</colcount>   </rastinfo>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <planar>     <mapproj>      <mapprojn>Albers Conical Equal Area</mapprojn>      <albers>       <stdparll>29.5</stdparll>       <stdparll>45.5</stdparll>       <longcm>&#45;96</longcm>       <latprjo>23</latprjo>       <feast>0.00000</feast>       <fnorth>0.00000</fnorth>      </albers>     </mapproj>     <planci>      <plance>Coordinate pair</plance>      <coordrep>       <absres>100.0</absres>       <ordres>100.0</ordres>      </coordrep>      <plandu>Meters</plandu>     </planci>    </planar>    <geodetic>     <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>     <ellips>GRS1980</ellips>     <semiaxis>6378206.4</semiaxis>     <denflat>294.98</denflat>    </geodetic>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover> The attribute data for the grid ks_100mcon are provided in an INFO data file called KS_100MCON.VAT.
