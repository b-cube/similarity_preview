Respondents were asked questions about   their commitment to and intellectual interest in arms control,   the importance of arms control as a foreign policy issue, basic   orientation to arms control, and the effects of their job   position on their attitude towards arms control. Also elicited  were respondents' perceptions of the influence of the ACDA,  Department of State, Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other   influences over policy. Respondents were queried about their   reaction to the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) I   agreement, their preference for SALT II, the Comprehensive Test   Ban Treaty, and expenditures for strategic nuclear weapons.   Demographic variables include age, education, and job rank. In  addition, biographical information is provided for other members of the ACDA who were not interviewed.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                     <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Members of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament  Agency (ACDA).</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data, and administrative records data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) personal interviews and self-enumerated   questionnaires, and (2) United States Department of State.
