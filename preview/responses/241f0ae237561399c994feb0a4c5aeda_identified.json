alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Many physicists say \\ufffd\\ufffd and some may even believe \\ufffd\\ufffd that peer review does not add much to their work, that they would do fine with just unrefereed preprints, and that they only continue to submit to peer-reviewed journals because they need to satisfy their promotion/evaluation committees.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And some of them may even be right. Certainly the giants in the field don\\ufffd\\ufffdt benefit from peer review. They have no peers, and for them peer-review just leads to regression on the mean.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But that criterion does not scale to the whole field, nor to other fields, and peer review continues to be needed to maintain quality standards. That\\ufffd\\ufffds just the nature of human endeavor.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And the quality vetting and tagging is needed before you risk investing the  time into reading, using and trying to build on work -- not after. (That&#039;s why it&#039;s getting so hard to find referees, why they&#039;re taking so long (and often not doing a conscientious enough job, especially for journals whose quality standards are at or below the mean.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Open Access means freeing peer-reviewed research from access tolls, not freeing it from peer review...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Harnad, S.

And now Orban extends an \\ufffd\\ufffdolive branch\\ufffd\\ufffd: \\ufffd\\ufffdLet\\ufffd\\ufffds let bygones be bygones. Forget these corruption charges. Back to business as usual.\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;/blockquote&gt;There is something profoundly rotten going on in Hungary these days. Media control and other shenanigans have so far prevented the electorate from smelling it, for two terms, but by now the stench is becoming overwhelming internationally, and it\\ufffd\\ufffds even beginning to get through to the noses of the Hungarian citizenry, who have been demonstrating nonviolently in growing numbers for Orban\\ufffd\\ufffds ouster. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Orban, with his US \\ufffd\\ufffdolive branch\\ufffd\\ufffd in one hand, has publicly floated threats to amend the lawshttp://openaccess.eprints.org/ of public assembly to put an end to this public unrest as part of a \\ufffd\\ufffdnational defence plan\\ufffd\\ufffd to protect Hungary from the foreign forces fomenting these expressions of dissatisfaction from his unruly citizenry for their sinister, anti-Hungarian purposes...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Go figure.      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Institutional Repositories, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2015-01-14T22:47:24Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1140</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1140</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1139-guid.html\">     <title>Journal publishing prices need to go down, not up</title>     <link>http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1139-Journal-publishing-prices-need-to-go-down,-not-up.html</link>     <description>     &lt;!-- s9ymdb:795 --&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;serendipity_image_right&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; height=&quot;78&quot; style=&quot;float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/uploads/foolsgold3.serendipityThumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today&#039;s transitional period for peer-reviewed journal publishing -- when both the price of subscribing to conventional journals and the price of publishing in open-access journals (&quot;Gold OA&quot;) is grossly inflated by obsolete costs and services -- is hardly the time to inflate costs still further by &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.sciencemag.org/scientific-community/2015/01/new-open-access-journal-plans-pay-peer-reviewers&quot;&gt;paying peer reviewers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Institutions and funders need to mandate the open-access self-archiving of all published articles first (&quot;Green OA&quot;).

The price per submitted paper of managing peer review -- since peers review, and always reviewed for free -- is low, fair, affordable and sustainable, on a no-fault basis (irrespective of whether the paper is accepted or rejected: accepted authors should not have to subsidize the cost of rejected papers).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Let&#039;s get there first, before contemplating whether we really want to raise that cost yet again, this time by paying peers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Harnad, S.

The UK Research Excellence Framework (REF) -- together with the growing movement toward making the full-texts of research articles freely available on the web -- offer a unique opportunity to test and validate a wealth of old and new scientometric predictors, through multiple regression analysis: Publications, journal impact factors, citations, co-citations, citation chronometrics (age, growth, latency to peak, decay rate), hub/authority scores, h-index, prior funding, student counts, co-authorship scores, endogamy/exogamy, textual proximity, download/co-downloads and their chronometrics, tweets, tags, etc.) can all be tested and validated jointly, discipline by discipline, against their REF panel rankings in REF2014. The weights of each predictor can be calibrated to maximize the joint correlation with the rankings. Open Access Scientometrics will provide powerful new means of navigating, evaluating, predicting and analyzing the growing Open Access database, as well as powerful incentives for making it grow faster.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Harnad, S.

In fact, open access metrics can be \\ufffd\\ufffd and will be \\ufffd\\ufffd continuously assessed, as open access grows. And as the initialized weights of the metric equation (per discipline) are optimized for predictive power, the metric equation can replace the peer rankings (except for periodic cross-checks and updates) -- or at least supplement it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Single metrics can be abused, but not only can abuses be named and shamed when detected, but it becomes harder to abuse metrics when they are part of a multiple, inter-correlated vector, with disciplinary profiles of their normal interactions: someone dispatching a robot to download his papers would quickly be caught out when the usual correlation between downloads and later citations fails to appear. Add more variables and it gets even harder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In a weighted vector of multiple metrics like the sample I had listed, it\\ufffd\\ufffds no use to a researcher if told in advance that for REF2020 the metric equation will be the following, with the following weights for their particular discipline:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REF2020Rank&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;w1&lt;/strong&gt;(pubcount) + &lt;strong&gt;w2&lt;/strong&gt;(JIF) + &lt;strong&gt;w3&lt;/strong&gt;(cites) +&lt;strong&gt;w4&lt;/strong&gt;(art-age) + &lt;strong&gt;w5&lt;/strong&gt;(art-growth)  + &lt;strong&gt;w6&lt;/strong&gt;(hits) + &lt;strong&gt;w7&lt;/strong&gt;(cite-peak-latency) + &lt;strong&gt;w8&lt;/strong&gt;(hit-peak-latency) + &lt;strong&gt;w9&lt;/strong&gt;(citedecay) + &lt;strong&gt;w10&lt;/strong&gt;(hitdecay) + &lt;strong&gt;w11&lt;/strong&gt;(hub-score) + &lt;strong&gt;w12&lt;/strong&gt;(authority+score) + &lt;strong&gt;w13&lt;/strong&gt;(h-index) + &lt;strong&gt;w14&lt;/strong&gt;(prior-funding) +&lt;strong&gt;w15&lt;/strong&gt;(bookcites) + &lt;strong&gt;w16&lt;/strong&gt;(student-counts) + &lt;strong&gt;w17&lt;/strong&gt;(co-cites + &lt;strong&gt;w18&lt;/strong&gt;(co-hits) + &lt;strong&gt;w19&lt;/strong&gt;(co-authors) + &lt;strong&gt;w20&lt;/strong&gt;(endogamy) + &lt;strong&gt;w21&lt;/strong&gt;(exogamy) + &lt;strong&gt;w22&lt;/strong&gt;(co-text) + &lt;strong&gt;w23&lt;/strong&gt;(tweets) + &lt;strong&gt;w24&lt;/strong&gt;(tags), + &lt;strong&gt;w25&lt;/strong&gt;(comments) + &lt;strong&gt;w26&lt;/strong&gt;(acad-likes) etc. etc.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The potential list could be much longer, and the weights can be positive or negative, and varying by discipline.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &quot;The man who is ready to prove that metric knowledge is wholly impossible\\ufffd\\ufffd is a brother metrician with rival metrics\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Research Assessment, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-12-17T13:42:22Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1137</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1137</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1136-guid.html\">     <title>The Only Substitute for Metrics is Better Metrics</title>     <link>http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1136-The-Only-Substitute-for-Metrics-is-Better-Metrics.html</link>     <description>     &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comment on:&lt;/strong&gt; Mryglod, Olesya,  Ralph Kenna, Yurij Holovatch and Bertrand Berche (2014)  Predicting the results of the REF using departmental h-index: A look at biology, chemistry, physics, and sociology.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/12/16/predicting-the-results-of-the-ref/&quot;&gt;LSE Impact Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; 12(6)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1369088-the-man-who-is-ready-to-prove-that-metaphysical-knowledge&quot;&gt;The man who is ready to prove that metaphysical knowledge is wholly impossible\\ufffd\\ufffd is a brother metaphysician with a rival theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd Bradley, F.

Lost Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Journal subscriptions are costly, unaffordable and growing, research funds are scarce, hard to come by and shrinking, and research access, usage, impact, productivity and progress are being needlessly lost every day that we fail to provide OA.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1. Over-Pricing:&lt;/strong&gt; Pre-green gold OA publication fees are arbitrarily and hugely over-priced. (We will see how much, and why, shortly.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2. Double-Payment:&lt;/strong&gt; Payment for pre-green gold is double payment: (i) subscription fees for incoming papers plus (ii) gold fees for outgoing papers. (Must-have subscription journals cannot be cancelled by an institution &lt;em&gt;until those same articles are accessible to users in some other way.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3. Double_Dipping:&lt;/strong&gt; On top of that, paying the same &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/search?num=20&amp;site=&amp;source=hp&amp;q=hybrid+gold+oa&amp;oq=hybrid+gold+oa&amp;gs_l=hp.3..0i22i30.2892.5822.0.6058.16.14.0.2.2.0.241.1922.0j13j1.14.0.msedr...0...1c.1.59.hp..2.14.1517.0.bxk16sv9ys8&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;hybrid gold&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal (both subscription and optional gold) for pre-green hybrid gold also allows publisher double-dipping.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;4. &quot;Rebates&quot;:&lt;/strong&gt; Even if the pre-green hybrid gold publisher promises all N of its subscribing institutions a full, 100% rebate on all hybrid gold income received, that only means that (N-1)/N of whatever hybrid gold any institution pays for its own outgoing hybrid gold papers becomes a &lt;em&gt;subsidy&lt;/em&gt; to all the other N-1 subscribing institutions: The institution only gets back 1/Nth of its hybrid gold outlay. (The UK, for example, would get back a 6% subscription rebate for its hybrid gold outlay; the rest of the UK hybrid gold outlay would become a rebate to the other 94% of subscribing institutions in the countries that were not foolish enough to pay pre-emptively for pre-green gold.) Unless the full gold OA rebate goes to the same institution that paid for the gold (by deducting it from the subscription fee), it is still double-payment. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5. Repositories:&lt;/strong&gt; Research funds are scarce, subscriptions are barely affordable, and pre-green gold payment is &lt;em&gt;completely unnecessary&lt;/em&gt;, because green OA can be provided at no extra cost. (Institutional repositories already exist anyway, for multiple purposes, so their cost per paper is negligible, particularly compared to the grotesque cost per paper for pre-green gold.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;6. CC-BY:&lt;/strong&gt; CC-BY is most definitely not so urgent today, compared to access itself, as to be worth the extra cost of pre-green gold today: CC-BY will come quite naturally of its own accord soon after universal green prevails, and at no extra cost. (We will see how and why shortly.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;7. Embargoes:&lt;/strong&gt; Publisher embargoes on green are ineffectual because of the repositories\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/search?num=20&amp;q=harnad+button&amp;oq=harnad+button&amp;gs_l=serp.3...33067.51356.0.51919.14.14.0.0.0.0.135.1650.0j14.14.0.msedr...0...1c.1.58.serp..6.8.973.0.9f0YhqTY7pw&quot;&gt;copy-request Button&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;em&gt;if, but &lt;u&gt;only if&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt; the paper was mandatorily deposited immediately upon acceptance for publication, exactly as HEFCE requires). &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The sole purpose of publishers&#039; OA embargoes today is to try to ensure that -- come what may -- their current level of revenue per paper published, whether via subscriptions or via fool&#039;s gold, is sustained.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Please pause for a moment to think this through. It says it all.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;8. Cancelation:&lt;/strong&gt; So post-green \\ufffd\\ufffd i.e., once immediate-deposit green has been mandated  and provided universally, by all institutions and funders, as HEFCE has done -- institutions can at last cancel their journal subscriptions, because then their users &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; access the content another way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;9. Obsolete Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; The post-green unsustainability of subscriptions will force publishers to cut all publishing costs that have been made obsolete by the post-green OA era: Publishers will be forced to phase out the print edition, the online edition, access-provision and archiving: these functions will now be offloaded onto the distributed global network of green OA institutional repositories. And publishers current level of revenue per article will not be sustained.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10. Fair Gold:&lt;/strong&gt; To cover the remaining post-green cost of peer-reviewed journal publishing \\ufffd\\ufffd which is just the cost of managing peer review itself \\ufffd\\ufffd post-green journals will convert to affordable, sustainable fair gold. Institutions will easily pay this service fee, per outgoing paper, out of a fraction of their windfall subscription cancelation savings on incoming papers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In other words, post-green, subscriptions will be gone, embargoes will be gone, and all OA will be CC-BY (where desired).&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Johnson: &lt;/strong&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffdWould repositories disappear in a gold OA world? No, they\\ufffd\\ufffdre still useful for theses etc. Monitoring would continue to be necessary for any OA policy.\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In the Post-green fair-gold OA world there will no longer be any need to monitor OA policy. Everything published will be fair-gold OA! But there will certainly be a need for the worldwide network of green OA repositories \\ufffd\\ufffd to provide access and archving in place of the pre-green subscription journals: &lt;em&gt;For it will have been the cancelation pressure generated by universally mandated-and-provided green OA that drove the entire downsizing and transition to fair gold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Harnad, S.

Particularly interesting to me is the notion that \\ufffd\\ufffdoffsetting\\ufffd\\ufffd schemes, even those that look quite generous on the face of it (like RSC, who offer APC vouchers equal to the full subscription rate of a given institution), are still set up to replace subscriptions with APCs at the 100% level.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; While it isn\\ufffd\\ufffdt a professional mission of mine to drive down the cost of scholarly communication at the expense of all else, clearly one of the most compelling advantages of your 100% green-leveraged transition idea is that it offers an opportunity to make the whole of scholarly publishing much cheaper than it is now. We should always be mindful that the price of OA publishing in \\ufffd\\ufffdtop\\ufffd\\ufffd journals can reach into the \\ufffd\\ufffd000\\ufffd\\ufffds but the cost of posting in a repository is \\ufffd\\ufffd33, and posting on the arXiv costs just $7 (as I read somewhere the other day). A case for the marginal benefit of spending those extra thousands of pounds on gold fees has, as far as I\\ufffd\\ufffdm aware, not been made \\ufffd\\ufffd even if that marginal benefit includes CC BY.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As I\\ufffd\\ufffdve argued before in this blog, I\\ufffd\\ufffdm not convinced that journal publishing need do much more than referee articles and stamp them with their brand sticker. So, while the system probably won\\ufffd\\ufffdt ever get down to being just $7 per article, there are strong public policy reasons why funders of research would not be averse to an outcome that managed to do away with a lot of the superfluities that surround that most highly affected of artefacts, the \\ufffd\\ufffdversion of record\\ufffd\\ufffd. (I do think there is a good strategic argument for wanting CC BY, though, if perhaps there is no economic or financial case.)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Most interestingly for the neutral, the success criterion of such a green-leveraged transition is identical to the success criterion of a gold future: both require ~100% uptake, globally. So this makes for an interesting fight, doesn\\ufffd\\ufffdt it? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Publishing Costs, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-12-05T02:08:12Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1135</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1135</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1133-guid.html\">     <title>The Access Gap at the Research Growth Tip</title>     <link>http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1133-The-Access-Gap-at-the-Research-Growth-Tip.html</link>     <description>     &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/uploads/OAhep-adv.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- s9ymdb:519 --&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;serendipity_image_right&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; height=&quot;83&quot; style=&quot;float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/uploads/OAhep-adv.serendipityThumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://science-metrix.com/en/publications/reports#/en/publications/reports/proportion-of-open-access-papers-published-in-peer-reviewed-journals-at-the&quot;&gt;EC-commisioned Science-Metrix study&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of interesting and useful information that I hope the EC will apply and use.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Access Timing.&lt;/strong&gt; The fundamental problem highlighted by the Science-Metrix findings is &lt;em&gt;timing&lt;/em&gt;: Over 50% of all articles published 2007-2012 are freely available today. But the trouble is that their percentage in the most critical years, namely, &lt;em&gt;the 1-2 years following publication&lt;/em&gt;, is far lower than that! This is partly because of publisher OA embargoes, partly because of author fears and sluggishness, but mostly because not enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1132-Estimating-Open-Access-Mandate-Effectiveness-I.-The-MELIBEA-Score.html&quot;&gt;strong, effective OA mandates&lt;/a&gt; have as yet been adopted by institutions and funders. I hope the Science-Metrix study will serve to motivate and accelerate the adoption of strong, effective OA mandates worldwide. That will narrow the gap at the all-important growth tip of research, which is its first 1-2 years.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A few things to bear in mind:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1. Delayed Access. &lt;/strong&gt;Publishers have essentially resigned themselves to &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1084-.html&quot;&gt;Delayed Access&lt;/a&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd i.e., free online access 1-2 years after publication. They know they can\\ufffd\\ufffdt stop it, and they know it doesn\\ufffd\\ufffdt have a significant effect on subscription revenues. Hence the real battle-ground for OA is the growth region of research: the 1-2 years following publication. That\\ufffd\\ufffds why OA mandates are so important.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2. Embargoes.&lt;/strong&gt; Most OA mandates allow an OA embargo during the first year folllowing publication. But there are ways that immediate research needs can be fulfilled even during an OA embargo, namely, via institutional repositories\\ufffd\\ufffd semi-automatic &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/CopyReqButton&quot;&gt;copy-request Button&lt;/a&gt;. For this Button to fulfill its purposes, however, OA mandates must require deposit immediately upon acceptance for publication, not just after a 6-12-month OA embargo has elapsed. There are still too few such immediate-deposit mandates, but the Science-Metrix study would have missed the &quot;almost-OA&quot; access that they provide unless it also measured Button-based copy-provision.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;3. Green OA, Gold OA and Non-OA.&lt;/strong&gt; It is incorrect that &quot;Green OA&quot; means only repository-based OA. Of course OA (free online access) provided on authors&#039; websites is Green OA too. The best way to define Green OA is OA provided by other than the publisher: Gold OA is provided by the publisher (though often paid for by the author or the author&#039;s institution or funder). Green OA is provided by the author, wherever the author provides the free online access. (And, although it is not the kind of OA advocated or mandated by institutions and funders, 3rd-party &quot;bootleg&quot; OA, apart from being hard to ascertain, is also Green OA: it certainly doesn&#039;t merit a color of its own -- and probably a lot of the back access is 3rd-party-provided rather than author-provided.) So the Science-Metrix data would be more informative and easier to interpret if it were all clearly classified as either Green OA, Gold OA, or non-OA. That would give a clearer idea of the relative size and growth rate of the two roads to OA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;4. The OA Impact Advantage.&lt;/strong&gt; I am sure that Gold OA would show the same OA impact advantage as Green OA if it were equally possible to measure it. The trouble is determining the non-OA baseline for comparison. &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013636&quot;&gt;Green OA impact studies&lt;/a&gt; can do this easily, by comparing OA and non-OA articles published in the same journal issue and year; Gold OA impact studies have the problem of equating OA and non-OA journals for content and quality. And although there are junk journals among both non-OA and Gold OA journals, it is undeniable that their proportions are higher among Gold OA journals (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/&quot;&gt;Beall&#039;s list&lt;/a&gt;) whereas the proportion of Gold OA journals themselves is still low. So their impact estimates would be dragged down by the junk-Gold journals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5. From Fools Gold to Fair Gold.&lt;/strong&gt; The Science-Metrix study is right that toll-access publishing will prove unsustainable in the long run. But it is mandatory Green OA self-archiving that will drive the transition to &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/FlsGold&quot;&gt;Fair-Gold OA&lt;/a&gt; sooner rather than later.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Harnad, S (2014) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/04/28/inflated-subscriptions-unsustainable-harnad/&quot;&gt;The only way to make inflated journal subscriptions unsustainable: Mandate Green Open Access&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;LSE Impact of Social Sciences Blog&lt;/em&gt; 4/28 &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Vincent-Lamarre, P., Boivin, J., Gargouri, Y., Lariviere, V., &amp;amp; Harnad, S.

This new capability complements the already existing &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/CopyReqButton&quot;&gt;copy-request Button&lt;/a&gt; implemented in many institutional repositories (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.eprints.org/w/RequestEprint&quot;&gt;EPprints&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC4x/Request+a+Copy#RequestaCopy-Introduction&quot;&gt;DSpace&lt;/a&gt;), which is reliably linked to the author&#039;s email address. The purpose of the repositories&#039; copy-request Button is to complement and &lt;a href=&quot;http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2926&quot;&gt;reinforce institutional and funder OA mandates&lt;/a&gt; that require authors to deposit their final, refereed drafts immediately upon acceptance for publication rather than only after a publisher OA embargo has elapsed.      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Scientometrics, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-10-23T06:43:00Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1133</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1133</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1132-guid.html\">     <title>Estimating Open Access Mandate Effectiveness: I.

We analyzed 68 mandated institutions for publication years 2011-2013 to determine how well the MELIBEA score and its individual conditions predict what percentage of published articles indexed by Web of Knowledge is deposited in each institution&#039;s OA repository, and when. We found a small but significant positive correlation (0.18) between MELIBEA score and deposit percentage. We also found that for three of the eight MELIBEA conditions (deposit timing, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?tbm=blg&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=blg&amp;q=liege+model+harnad&quot;&gt;internal use&lt;/a&gt;, and opt-outs), one value of each was strongly associated with deposit percentage or deposit latency (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/webhp?tbm=blg&amp;gws_rd=ssl#tbm=blg&amp;q=idoa+harnad&quot;&gt;immediate deposit required&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/rsrch/rinfrastruct/oa/policy/&quot;&gt;deposit required for performance evaluation&lt;/a&gt;, unconditional opt-out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt-out for deposit requirement). When we updated the initial values and weights of the MELIBEA formula for mandate effectiveness to reflect the empirical association we had found, the score&#039;s predictive power doubled (.36). There are not yet enough OA mandates to test further mandate conditions that might contribute to mandate effectiveness, but these findings already suggest that it would be useful for future mandates to adopt these three conditions so as to maximize their effectiveness, and thereby the growth of OA.      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Self-Archiving Mandates, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-10-14T10:29:09Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1132</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1132</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1131-guid.html\">     <title>More FUD From the Publishers Association About the HEFCE/REF Deposit Mandate</title>     <link>http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1131-More-FUD-From-the-Publishers-Association-About-the-HEFCEREF-Deposit-Mandate.html</link>     <description>     &lt;!-- s9ymdb:87 --&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;serendipity_image_left&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; height=&quot;37&quot; style=&quot;float: left; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/uploads/hefce.serendipityThumb.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- s9ymdb:796 --&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/rsrch/rinfrastruct/oa/policy/&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;serendipity_image_right&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; height=&quot;63&quot; style=&quot;float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/uploads/ref14.serendipityThumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In response to the HEFCE &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/rsrch/rinfrastruct/oa/policy/&quot;&gt;Open Access Policy&lt;/a&gt; for REF2020, the Publishers Association has made the following &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/whatwedo/research/infrastructure/openaccess/faq/RM_to_HEFCE.pdf&quot;&gt;counter-proposal&lt;/a&gt;, which is as predictable as the succession of night upon day:&lt;strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Don&#039;t require deposit upon the date of acceptance, because publisher embargoes are timed to begin on the date of publication, not the date of acceptance.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. Don&#039;t require deposit of the author&#039;s final draft; wait for the publisher&#039;s version of record.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. Don&#039;t require deposit at all: &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?serendipity%5Baction%5D=search&amp;serendipity%5BsearchTerm%5D=chorus&amp;serendipity%5BsearchButton%5D=%3E&quot;&gt;let us take care of it&lt;/a&gt;, after our embargo has elapsed: then you don&#039;t have to worry about figuring out the date of publication.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4. Please send us a justification for wanting to do otherwise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Now I find these four points so outrageous and presumptuous -- and so transparently self-interested, running roughshod over the interests of research, researchers, their institutions, their funders, and the tax-paying public -- that they don&#039;t need to be answered at all (and of course they need not and should not be heeded in any way).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But past experience has shown that the research community (like Schultz&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100523172400/peanuts/images/a/a0/1107charlie_brown_lucy_football.jpg&quot;&gt;Charlie Brown and the annual football&lt;/a&gt; that Lucy always manages to pull out from under him every time) somehow always manages to fall for publisher FUD. The FUD is invariably formulated to appear as if the publishers are just trying to help, and make things simpler and easier for the research community. But what keeps being missed by the naive research community is that the complications and difficulties that the publishers&#039; proposals to &quot;help&quot; with are invariably&lt;em&gt; complications and difficulties that are being imposed by the publishers themselves&lt;/em&gt;, in the form of embargoes and restrictions!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In the present case it&#039;s all about ensuring the one thing that is important to publishers about open access and open-access mandates: that publishers&#039; embargoes on Green OA are faithfully obeyed (unless, even better, the author pays for immediate Gold OA). Nothing to do with ensuring OA, and as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The short answers to these four pieces of publisher FUD are, accordingly:&lt;blockquote&gt;1. &lt;em&gt;No thank you.&lt;/em&gt; We want deposit to be done as soon as the paper is refereed and accepted, because (i) that is when the paper is ready to be used by researchers, (ii) many publishers do not embargo OA, and (iii) even if there is a publisher OA embargo and an author wishes to comply, the author can provide individual copies to individual users with the repository&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/CopyReqButton&quot;&gt;request-copy-Button&lt;/a&gt; immediately upon deposit during the embargo -- as long as the final draft is deposited immediately upon acceptance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 2. &lt;em&gt;No thank you.&lt;/em&gt; The acceptance date is clear and certain for all papers, and it is the earliest access point; the date of publication is later, sometimes much, much later, and its timing is variable and indeterminate (cover date often does not correspond to date the issue appears). And besides coming too late, the publisher&#039;s version of record has more (publisher) restrictions on it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 3. &lt;em&gt;No thank you.&lt;/em&gt; We would rather retain control of providing Button-access, and then OA, to our own final drafts; and we can track the embargo for ourselves, thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; 4. &lt;em&gt;No thank you.&lt;/em&gt; Please send us your justification for asking research institutions and funders to justify to publishers when they require their researchers to deposit their final drafts: We are not talking about OA or embargoes here but about deposit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;That said, here is some tit-for-tat for the Publishers Association&#039;s letter to HEFCE:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Following the publication of HEFCE\\ufffd\\ufffds statement of policy in March 2014 The Publishers Association and its members have been consulting with other stakeholders as to how best we in the publishing community can assist researchers and institutions to comply with the policy, particularly with regards to the deposit requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;With regards (and all due respect), the deposit requirements have nothing to do with publishers (or with publisher embargoes on OA).&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In the course of these conversations it has become clear that this aspect of the policy is a source of widespread concern. Therefore I am writing to ask if HEFCE would give serious consideration to reviewing and revising certain elements of it.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;No doubt there is publisher concern about the deposit requirement: That concern is precisely because deposits (unlike OA embargoes) cannot be &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?serendipity%5Baction%5D=search&amp;serendipity%5BsearchTerm%5D=chorus&amp;serendipity%5BsearchButton%5D=%3E&quot;&gt;controlled by publishers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;For us, the problematic section is Section 18 which states that \\ufffd\\ufffdthe output must have been deposited as soon after the point of acceptance as possible and no later than three months after this date (as given in the acceptance letter or email from the publications to the author)\\ufffd\\ufffd. &lt;br /&gt; Section 19 then goes on to require that the output must have been deposited as the author\\ufffd\\ufffds accepted and final peer-reviewed text, which may later be updated by the version of record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Never mind the version of record. It&#039;s another matter. We&#039;re talking here about the author&#039;s final draft, and the time it is to be deposited.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;For the avoidance of doubt, The PA and members are of course in no way opposed to the principle of deposit per se; rather we are concerned with the timing and form of the mandatory deposit.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, it&#039;s good to know that the PA are in no way opposed to something that is none of their business, and over which they have no control. But then why mention it at all?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;In paragraph 29 of the Consultation Document on the Policy (July 2013) HEFCE stated that: &lt;br /&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffdWe also wish to make the process of compliance as simple as possible for authors and HEIs and have received advice that the point of acceptance would be more suitable.\\ufffd\\ufffd The PA\\ufffd\\ufffds response to the Consultation (October 2013) spoke to this point by saying \\ufffd\\ufffdit is unclear where this advice has come from and what the justification for it is. To ensure compliance with embargo periods, which commence from the date of publication, it is logical to coincide the deposit or linking of papers with the publication date.\\ufffd\\ufffd&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Is the PA owed a justification for a deposit policy that is none of its business and out of its control? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And why are publisher embargoes even being mentioned in this context? Yes, publisher OA embargoes are timed from date of publication (which varies wildly from paper to paper). But the issue here is &lt;em&gt;deposit&lt;/em&gt; -- not publisher OA embargoes or their timing.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There is no link (logical or otherwise) between the deposit date, publication date, and embargo end-date.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Our subsequent discussions have confirmed us in our view that it would be far preferable for HEIs, researchers and publishers that the timing of the deposit of papers be coincident with the date of the publication of the version of record. This is for two principal reasons:  &lt;br /&gt; It would allow for the clearer management of embargo periods. Since these begin at the point of publication, deposit in institutional repository at this point removes the potential for any confusion arising between the availability of the accepted author manuscript and the version of record. Repositories will need to know the date of publication in order to respect the embargo period but they cannot know this from the date of acceptance.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;As stated, OA embargo periods are reckoned from the (variable) publication date, not from deposit date. They have nothing to do with deposit date.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And OA is OA whether it is OA to the author&#039;s final draft or OA to the publisher&#039;s version of record (which has extra usage restrictions). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The HEFCE/REF mandate is to deposit the final draft upon acceptance and to provide OA after the allowable embargo at the latest. No later version is stipulated.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And the only version that is available until publication (and can hence be made OA or can be provided via the Button during an OA embargo) is the author&#039;s version.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;It would reduce the level of costs to HEIs, many of which have expressed concerns about the financial and administrative burden of ingesting author manuscripts in their repositories. We understand that for many institutions this will require a number of operations (for example, subsequent up-dating of data) to be performed manually which could be fulfilled automatically if deposit of the author manuscript is made upon publication. Not all HEIs have repositories capable of dealing with this requirement at present.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;It is terribly good of publishers to worry about institutions&#039; operating expenses! There is a very useful way in which publishers could help lower these expenses: charge less for journals, or drop OA embargoes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But no help is needed with deposit, thank you very much. Authors are quite capable of depositing for themselves, as well as reckoning OA embargo intervals. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Some stakeholders have made proposals for mitigating what we would see as the adverse effects of the proposed policy: for example encouraging publishers to provide author manuscripts and metadata in a standardised format through the Jisc \\ufffd\\ufffdPublishers Router\\ufffd\\ufffd. &lt;br /&gt; However, this would not address the central issue of the clear potential for confusion around the start date of the embargo period, which often will not be known at the point of acceptance. For many publishers, this proposed mitigation would imply an additional cost, which seems somewhat unreasonable to ask publishers to bear when we believe that deposit at the point of publication would eliminate these costs and concerns without compromising the policy\\ufffd\\ufffds goals to advance open access.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To repeat: determining the date of publication and the date of the end of the embargo has nothing whatsoever to do with date of deposit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It is clear that from the publishers&#039; point of view, the ideal outcome (if there is to be Green OA at all) is that it should be the publisher (who knows the date of publication, who owns the version of record, and who imposes the OA embargo) who controls the deposit, its timing, and the timing of the embargo.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; No, thank you. This is not about depositing as late as possible, and providing OA as late as possible, but about exactly the reverse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;Ultimately we believe that any of these mitigating or alternative solutions are poor substitutes for amending the underlying policy requirement. &lt;br /&gt; It would greatly help our understanding of the HEFCE stance if you were able to share with us the justification for the policy \\ufffd\\ufffd as referred to in last year\\ufffd\\ufffds consultation \\ufffd\\ufffd and your perspective on the costs.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Publishers have no right to ask institutions and funders for &quot;justification&quot; of deposit policies if the deposits are not OA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But if you want a general idea: it is to provide Open Access -- or at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/CopyReqButton&quot;&gt;Button access&lt;/a&gt; -- to refereed research as soon as the refereed final draft is ready.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;PA&lt;/u&gt;: &quot;We would be grateful if you would give consideration to amending this aspect of open access policy. We believe it will act as a hindrance to the widespread take up of open access in the UK research community, whereas a requirement to deposit in an institutional repository on publication would be a policy which would command support from a much wider range of sector stakeholders.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Good of publishers to be so concerned about compliance with the HEFCE deposit mandate, but, no, &lt;a href=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?serendipity%5Baction%5D=search&amp;serendipity%5BsearchTerm%5D=chorus&amp;serendipity%5BsearchButton%5D=%3E&quot;&gt;ceding control to publishers over deposit timing&lt;/a&gt; is not the way to ensure compliance. Making compliance a prerequisite for REF eligibility is. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Happily, HEFCE was unfazed by this FUD. See how they have advised the Publishers Association (rather more diplomatically than I have put it above) that, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/whatwedo/research/infrastructure/openaccess/faq/HEFCE_to_RM.pdf&quot;&gt;no thanks, we will stay the course&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stevan Harnad&lt;/strong&gt;      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Publishing Lobby, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-10-13T23:54:09Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1131</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1131</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1130-guid.html\">     <title>The Fruits of Finch/RCUK Profligacy (and Publishing Lobby Success) </title>     <link>http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1130-The-Fruits-of-FinchRCUK-Profligacy-and-Publishing-Lobby-Success.html</link>     <description>     &lt;!-- s9ymdb:764 --&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;serendipity_image_right&quot; width=&quot;110&quot; height=&quot;110&quot; style=&quot;float: right; border: 0px; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px;&quot; src=&quot;http://openaccess.eprints.org/uploads/Rcuk-logo1.serendipityThumb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;Here they are:&lt;blockquote&gt;Corn\\ufffd\\ufffde, Nathalie and Madjarevic, Natalia (2014) &lt;a href=&quot;http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/59521/&quot;&gt;The London School of Economics and Political Science 2013/2014 RCUK open access compliance report&lt;/a&gt;. The London School of Economics and Political Science, Library, London, UK.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt; In September 2014, the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) reported to Research Councils UK on the School\\ufffd\\ufffds compliance with the recently introduced RCUK Policy on Open Access (OA). This reports provides detail around the article processing charges (APC) data and RCUK Call for Evidence report. Background In April 2013, the revised RCUK Policy on Open Access came into effect. The policy requires journal articles or conference proceedings arising from research funded wholly or partially by a RCUK grant should be made freely available online (or \\ufffd\\ufffdOpen Access\\ufffd\\ufffd). There are two main routes to make papers open access: a) the Green route, which is the LSE preferred route, when the full text of papers are deposited into an institutional repository such as LSE Research Online. To select this route, embargo periods must be no longer than the 12 months permitted by RCUK (no charge applies); b) the Gold route, which provides immediate, unrestricted access to the final version of the paper via the publisher&#039;s website, often using a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) licence - it may involve payment of an APC to the publisher. In 2013, we received the &lt;strong&gt;RCUK OA block grant for 2013/14 of \\ufffd\\ufffd62,862.&lt;/strong&gt; We set up the LSE Institutional Publication Fund using this grant and this was managed by the Library, allowing eligible RCUK-funded researchers to apply for APC funds. Additionally, the School was awarded a &lt;strong&gt;pump-prime funding allocation from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)&lt;/strong&gt; for open access, which was also added to the fund. Of the 141 papers we identified as RCUK-funded for Year 1, &lt;strong&gt;50 papers are open access via the Green&lt;/strong&gt; route and &lt;strong&gt;73 via the Gold&lt;/strong&gt;, resulting in an &lt;strong&gt;87% compliance&lt;/strong&gt; rate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Seventy-three (73) OA articles, at about \\ufffd\\ufffd1,000 a shot via Gold -- vs. fifty (50) at no cost via Green!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That RCUK \\ufffd\\ufffd62,862 could have funded 4 doctoral research students or 2 postdoctoral researchers. Instead, it is paying publishers even more than they are already being paid for subscriptions (and for hybrid Gold publishers it&#039;s even double-paying them).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; For 73 articles!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And 73 articles that could have been provided for free via Green -- if instead of dangling scarce money in front of authors RCUK had simply insisted on immediate deposit, irrespective of embargo length.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; One can only hope that the spot-on and timely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/rsrch/rinfrastruct/oa/&quot;&gt;new HEFCE policy of requiring immediate deposit, now, in order to be eligible for REF2020&lt;/a&gt;, will stanch this gratuitous, obdurate Finch/RCUK profligacy.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And that the EU&#039;s similar policy will help reinforce it.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Meanwhile there&#039;s nothing stopping institutions from being more sensible, by requiring immediate deposit and using the RCUK windfall to better purpose (till it is sensibly redirected to research).      </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Self-Archiving Mandates, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-09-28T15:41:38Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1130</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1130</wfw:commentRss>           </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1129-guid.html\">     <title>Algorithmic Almanacs: Lots, Bots and Nots</title>     <link>http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1129-Algorithmic-Almanacs-Lots,-Bots-and-Nots.html</link>     <description>     &lt;blockquote&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;em&gt;The world&#039;s most prolific writer: &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/sverkerjohansson&quot;&gt;Sverker Johansson&lt;/a&gt; has created more than three million Wikipedia articles, around one tenth of the entire content of the site.

It\\ufffd\\ufffds interesting, though, that so many Wikipedia entries can be generated algorithmically. The boundary between an encyclopedia and an almanac or even a chronicle of events has long been blurred by Wikipedia. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But it is a good idea to keep in mind that what is easy to generate algorithmically (and via its close cousin, &lt;em&gt;crowdsourcing&lt;/em&gt;) in the googlized digital era, is simple or 1st-order facts: Answers to &lt;em&gt;what?/when?/where?&lt;/em&gt; questions: Apples are red, the sky is blue, it rained in Burma on Tuesday, Chelsea beat Burnley 4-2.. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The real source of all this factual information is Google\\ufffd\\ufffds global digital database, and the fact that Google has reverse-indexed it all, making it searchable by Boolean (&lt;em&gt;and/or/not&lt;/em&gt;) search algorithms as well as by more complex computational (Turing) algorithms.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The questions that are much harder to answer algorithmically, even with all of the Google database and all the Boolean/Turing tools, are the higher-order &lt;em&gt;how?/why?&lt;/em&gt; questions. If those could all be answered algorithmically, most of theoretical (i.e., non-experimental) science would be finished by now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And the reason for that is probably that our brains don\\ufffd\\ufffdt find all those how/why answers just algorithmically either, but also via dynamical (analog, sensorimotor) means that may prove accessible to future Turing-Test scale &lt;em&gt;sensorimotor robots&lt;/em&gt;, but certainly not to today&#039;s purely &lt;em&gt;symbolic bots&lt;/em&gt;, operating on purely symbolic databases.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In other words, it\\ufffd\\ufffds down to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://j.mp/symgro&quot;&gt;symbol grounding problem&lt;/a&gt; again\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stevan Harnad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;       </description>      <dc:publisher>Open Access Archivangelism</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>nospam@example.com (Stevan Harnad)</dc:creator>     <dc:subject>     Scientometrics, </dc:subject>     <dc:date>2014-09-16T13:01:54Z</dc:date>     <wfw:comment>http://openaccess.eprints.org/wfwcomment.php?cid=1129</wfw:comment>         <slash:comments>0</slash:comments>         <wfw:commentRss>http://openaccess.eprints.org/rss.php?version=1.0&amp;type=comments&amp;cid=1129</wfw:commentRss>           </item>  </rdf:RDF> ",
