The survey research organisation is NatCen Social Research (formerly the National Centre for Social Research), and in Northern Ireland, the Central Survey Unit of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; As a multi-topic household survey, the purpose of &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; is to understand social and economic change in Britain at the household and individual levels. It is anticipated that over time the study will permit examination of short- and long-term effects of social and economic change, including policy interventions, on the general well-being of the UK population. The study has a strong emphasis on domains of family and social ties, work, financial resources, and health. Further information about the survey may be found in the documentation, and on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.understandingsociety.org.uk/\" title = \"Understanding Society\"&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/a&gt; web site.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The study is an annual survey of each adult member of a nationally representative sample. The same individuals are re-interviewed in each wave. If individuals leave their household, all adult members of their new household are interviewed. Each wave is collected over 24 months, such that the first wave of data was collected between January 2009 and January 2011, the second wave between January 2010 and January 2012, and so forth.  Data collection takes place using computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). One person completes the household questionnaire. Each person aged 16 or older answers the individual adult interview and self-completion questionnaire. Young people aged 10 to 15 years are asked to respond to a paper self-completion questionnaire.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The study has four sample components: the General Population component, the Innovation Panel, a boost sample of ethnic minority group members, and participants in the former &lt;i&gt;British Household Panel Survey&lt;/i&gt; (BHPS) (held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5151 - Secure Access version held under SN 6340). Waves 1-2 include the General Population component and the ethnic minority boost sample. The Innovation Panel data are held separately under End User Licence SN 6849 (Special Licence version held under SN 7083; Secure Access version held under SN 7332). Former participants of the BHPS joined &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; from Wave 2. BHPS sample members have an identifier within the &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; datasets from Wave 2 onwards, allowing the matching of BHPS data to &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;</abstract>       <abstract>&lt;b&gt;Secure Access Dataset:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; The &lt;I&gt;Understanding Society: Linked National Pupil Database: Secure Access&lt;/I&gt; study contains six files extracted from the English National Pupil Database (NPD). These can be linked (within the Secure Access service) to &lt;I&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/I&gt; participants using the cross-wave personal identifier (variable pidp). The NPD files include information on pupil background and attainment for all individuals with a valid consent to education linkage collected in Wave 1 of Understanding Society. This includes consents collected from parents of children aged 4-15 and of young adults aged 16+ and born in 1981 or later. The included files cover Pupil Level Annual School Census (PLASC) on pupil background as well as pupil attainment data for the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile (EYFSP) (age 5) and Key Stages (KS) 1 (age 7), KS2 (age 11), KS3 (age 14) and KS4 (age 16). See documentation for further details.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Related UK Data Archive studies&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br&gt; The Secure Access version of &lt;I&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/I&gt; is held under SN 6676. This  has more restrictive access conditions than standard End User Licence or Special Licence Access versions; further details and links to the less restrictive versions can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000053\" title=\"Understanding Society series\"&gt;Understanding Society series Key data&lt;/a&gt; webpage.&lt;br&gt; The Archive also holds separate (i.e. not linked to &lt;I&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/I&gt;) data from the National Pupil Database, available under Secure Access and Safe Room Access conditions. See SNs 7626, 7627 and 7628 (Secure Access) and SNs 7590, 7625, 7600, 7595, 7612 and 7606 (Safe Room Access) for details.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>&lt;B&gt;Main Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Topics covered in the data files include educational attainment scores and test/examination results, with a linking variable for matching with &lt;I&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/I&gt; data as noted in the Abstract section above. Local authority identifiers and individual school codes are included in the data. Demographic information such as ethnic groups, languages spoken at home, deprivation indices, eligibility for free school meals and special educational needs is also included in the PLASC Census file.
