<link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.108/title.a-link-between-the-hiatus-in-global-warming-and-north-american-drought</link>  <description>The authors use three GFDL climate models (CM2.1, CM2.5_FLOR, CM2.5_FLOR_FA) to study the mechanisms behind the hiatus in global warming over the last decade and their possible relationship to southwestern U.S. drought.  This study suggests that a majority of the drought in the southwestern U.S. over the last decade is the result of persistent anomalous wind conditions in the tropical Pacific, and is likely due to natural variability.   </description>  <dc:subject>Weather and Climate Extremes</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2015-03-13</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.107/title.improved-seasonal-prediction-of-temperature-and-precipitation-over-land-in-a-high-resolution-gfdl-climate-model\">  <title>Improved Seasonal Prediction of Temperature and Precipitation over Land  in a High-resolution GFDL Climate Model</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.107/title.improved-seasonal-prediction-of-temperature-and-precipitation-over-land-in-a-high-resolution-gfdl-climate-model</link>  <description>Skillful seasonal predictions of surface temperature and precipitation over land are in demand, due to their importance to ecosystems and sectors such as agriculture, energy, transportation.

These fluctuations are superimposed on a longer term upward trend associated with the rise in global mean sea level, with global mean sea level rising at roughly 3 mm per year during the recent 20 years of accurate satellite measures. For society, it is the regional changes along any particular coastal zone that are most important.  Our analysis of multi-decadal tide gauge records along the North American east coast identified an extreme sea-level rise event during 2009\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2010. Within this relatively brief two-year period, coastal sea level north of New York City jumped by up to 128 mm. This magnitude of inter-annual sea level rise is unprecedented in the tide gauge records, with statistical methods suggesting that it was a 1-in-850 year event. </description>  <dc:subject>Weather and Climate Extremes</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2015-02-24</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.105/title.tropical-climate-change-control-of-the-lower-stratospheric-circulation\">  <title>Tropical Climate Change Control of the Lower Stratospheric Circulation</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.105/title.tropical-climate-change-control-of-the-lower-stratospheric-circulation</link>  <description>Tropical air has less ozone than polar air, even though the tropical stratosphere is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. The Brewer-Dobson circulation is considered key to understanding this apparent contrast. It also brings water vapor, aerosols and other species from the troposphere up into the stratosphere. The strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation directly affects the thermal structure of the stratosphere and upper troposphere, and impacts the transport and distribution of important climate-influencing constituents including stratospheric water vapor, ozone, and volcanic aerosols.</description>  <dc:subject>Atmospheric Composition and Air Quality</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2015-02-05</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.103/title.drivers-of-trophic-amplification-of-ocean-productivity-trends-in-a-changing-climate\">  <title>Drivers of trophic amplification of ocean productivity trends in a changing climate</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.103/title.drivers-of-trophic-amplification-of-ocean-productivity-trends-in-a-changing-climate</link>  <description>Earth System Models (ESMs) project that climate change will lead to approximately 1-10% declines in global ocean phytoplankton productivity by the end of the 21st century, under high carbon emissions scenarios.  This decline results from projected increases in ocean stratification under global warming, which hinders the supply of deep ocean nutrients to the well-lit surface ocean.  </description>  <dc:subject>Climate Impacts</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2014-12-16</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.102/title.karakoram-snowfall-less-sensitive-to-warming-than-himalayas-due-to-a-unique-seasonal-cycle\">  <title>Karakoram snowfall less sensitive to warming than Himalayas due to a unique seasonal cycle</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.102/title.karakoram-snowfall-less-sensitive-to-warming-than-himalayas-due-to-a-unique-seasonal-cycle</link>  <description>The high mountains of Asia, including the Karakoram, Himalayas, and Tibetan Plateau, combine to form a region of perplexing hydroclimate changes. Glaciers in the Karakoram region have exhibited mass stability or even expansion, contrasting with glacial mass loss across the nearby Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau.  This suggests that different regional snowfall or temperature signals might be detected in the Karakoram region. However, the remote location, complex terrain, and multi-country fabric of high-mountain Asia have made it difficult to maintain longer-term monitoring systems of the meteorological components that can influence glacial change.</description>  <dc:subject>Climate Variability and Prediction</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2014-10-12</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.101/title.seasonal-and-annual-mean-precipitation-extremes-occurring-during-2013-a-u-s-focused-analysis\">  <title>Seasonal- and annual-mean precipitation extremes occurring during 2013:  A U.S. focused analysis</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.101/title.seasonal-and-annual-mean-precipitation-extremes-occurring-during-2013-a-u-s-focused-analysis</link>  <description>Extreme seasonal/annual precipitation, defined here as ranking first, second, or third highest or lowest in the record of at least 100 years, occurred in several continental U.S. regions during 2013. The authors of this study used CMIP5 models to simulate internal climate variability and the response to historical anthropogenic and natural forcings, for the Northern Tier and the Upper Midwest regions of the U.S. This study suggests that, for these two regions, extreme annual or seasonal positive precipitation anomalies over the U.S. were at least partly attributable to a combination of anthropogenic and natural forcing.</description>  <dc:subject>Weather and Climate Extremes</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2014-09-29</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.100/title.retrieval-of-tropical-storm-statistics-by-combining-data-with-a-high-resolution-coupled-model\">  <title>Retrieval of Tropical Storm Statistics by Combining Data with a High-Resolution Coupled Model</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.100/title.retrieval-of-tropical-storm-statistics-by-combining-data-with-a-high-resolution-coupled-model</link>  <description>In order to produce better seasonal-to-interannual climate predictions, GFDL scientists explored improvements in the method of initializing a high-resolution coupled model.   Traditionally, when observations are assimilated into a high-resolution coupled model, small-scale cyclones tend to get filtered out in the process of making corrections to the large-scale background. GFDL scientists pioneered a method of processing the large-scale background and the small-scale perturbations separately in a cyclone-permitting model. </description>  <dc:subject>Climate Variability and Prediction</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2014-09-17</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.99/title.predicting-a-decadal-shift-in-north-atlantic-climate-variability-using-the-gfdl-forecast-system\">  <title>Predicting a decadal shift in North Atlantic climate variability using the GFDL forecast system</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.99/title.predicting-a-decadal-shift-in-north-atlantic-climate-variability-using-the-gfdl-forecast-system</link>  <description>The goals of this research were to assess the role of AMOC in global climate and identify the predictability of the associated climate impacts.  Decadal prediction experiments were conducted as part of CMIP5 using a prototype GFDL-CM2.1 forecast system. The abrupt warming of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (SPG), observed in the mid-1990s, was used as a case study to evaluate the forecast capabilities of the model, and to better understand the reasons for the observed changes.</description>  <dc:subject>Climate Variability and Prediction</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2014-08-22</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.98/title.seasonal-forecasting-of-regional-tropical-cyclone-activity\">  <title>Seasonal Forecasting of Regional Tropical Cyclone Activity</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.98/title.seasonal-forecasting-of-regional-tropical-cyclone-activity</link>  <description>Tropical cyclones (TCs, which include hurricanes and typhoons) are a major climate hazard across the Northern Hemisphere, and have exhibited variability and change on year-to-year timescales.

Additional studies have also demonstrated that the cessation of carbon emissions results in a stabilization or decrease of global mean surface air temperature.  Such studies generally assume either a 1%/year increase or an instantaneous doubling/quadrupling of atmospheric CO2.   </description>  <dc:subject>Atmospheric Physics and Climate</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2014-06-26</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.90/title.the-role-of-global-climate-change-in-the-extreme-low-summer-arctic-sea-ice-extent-in-2012\">  <title>The Role of Global Climate Change in the Extreme Low Summer Arctic Sea Ice Extent in 2012</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.90/title.the-role-of-global-climate-change-in-the-extreme-low-summer-arctic-sea-ice-extent-in-2012</link>  <description>The rapid change in summer Arctic sea ice could have significant large scale climatic, ecological, and economic impacts.

The models were used to investigate the causes of the unusual warmth during March-May 2012 that occurred over the eastern U.S. The 20th century warming trend that was observed in this region is consistent with the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble results of All-Forcing runs but not consistent with model runs that did not include external forcing. </description>  <dc:subject>Climate Change Variability and Prediction</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2013-09-18</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.86/title.global-scale-carbon-and-energy-flows-through-the-planktonic-food-web-an-analysis-with-a-coupled-physical-biological-model\">  <title>Global-scale carbon and energy flows through the planktonic food web: an analysis with a coupled physical-biological model</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.86/title.global-scale-carbon-and-energy-flows-through-the-planktonic-food-web-an-analysis-with-a-coupled-physical-biological-model</link>  <description>Planktonic food web dynamics shape biogeochemical cycles and global patterns of ocean productivity across trophic levels.  Primary production alone, for example, is a poor predictor of cross-ecosystem differences in fisheries yields.  Predictive capability improves only after consideration of factors such as the number and efficiency of trophic links separating phytoplankton and fish.  Limited representation and validation of planktonic food web dynamics within the present generation of Earth System Models limits both their resolution of biogeochemical processes and their utility for assessing climate impacts on living marine resources.  </description>  <dc:subject>Climate and Ecosystems</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2013-09-10</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.82/title.multi-model-assessment-of-regional-surface-temperature-trends-cmip3-and-cmip5-20th-century-simulations\">  <title>Multi-Model Assessment of Regional Surface Temperature Trends: CMIP3 and CMIP5 20th  Century Simulations</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.82/title.multi-model-assessment-of-regional-surface-temperature-trends-cmip3-and-cmip5-20th-century-simulations</link>  <description>Evaluating climate simulations against observational data is a fundamental step in the evaluation and eventual improvement of models. Models can also help test our understanding of the causes of past variations of climate seen in the historical record. This analysis shows how current climate models, including those developed by NOAA, compare with observations in terms of their regional surface temperature trends since 1901.</description>  <dc:subject>Climate Change Variability and Prediction</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2013-08-30</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.87/title.model-projections-of-the-changes-in-atmospheric-circulation-and-surface-climate-over-north-america-north-atlantic-and-europe-in-the-21st-century\">  <title>Model Projections of the Changes in Atmospheric Circulation and Surface Climate           over North America, North Atlantic and Europe in the 21st Century</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.87/title.model-projections-of-the-changes-in-atmospheric-circulation-and-surface-climate-over-north-america-north-atlantic-and-europe-in-the-21st-century</link>  <description>The impacts of climate change on the North America-North Atlantic-Europe sector are studied using a coupled general circulation model (CM3) and a high-resolution atmosphere-only model (HIRAM), both developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory.

Aerosols are likely responsible for the observed earlier onset, resulting in enhanced June precipitation over most of India. This shift is preceded by strong aerosol forcing over the Bay of Bengal and Indochina, mostly attributable to the direct effect, resulting in increased atmospheric stability that inhibits the monsoon migration in May.</description>  <dc:subject>Atmospheric Physics Chemistry and Climate</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2013-07-19</dc:date> </item>  <item rdf:about=\"http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.84/title.dynamical-downscaling-projections-of-late-21st-century-atlantic-hurricane-activity-cmip3-and-cmip5-model-based-scenarios\">  <title>Dynamical Downscaling Projections of Late 21st Century Atlantic Hurricane Activity:  CMIP3 and CMIP5 Model-based Scenarios</title>  <link>http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/index/news-app/story.84/title.dynamical-downscaling-projections-of-late-21st-century-atlantic-hurricane-activity-cmip3-and-cmip5-model-based-scenarios</link>  <description>The authors explored the influence of anthropogenic climate change on Atlantic hurricane activity in the 21st century, using dynamical climate models.  The results of experiments using multi-model climate change scenarios were compared, with one scenario taken from CMIP3 (A1B), and one from CMIP5 (RCP4.5).  A significant reduction in the frequency of tropical storms and hurricanes is projected for both CMIP3 and CMIP5 ensembles.  </description>  <dc:subject>Climate Change Variability and Prediction</dc:subject>  <dc:date>2013-06-24</dc:date> </item>   </rdf:RDF> ",
