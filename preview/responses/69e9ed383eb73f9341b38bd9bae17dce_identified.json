We can review the technical portion of the proposal to help ensure that it is plausible and realistic, and that it describes the use of TEI in a persuasive manner. We can also help projects think through the strategic and practical issues involved in designing a TEI project, so that costs and staffing can be accurately assessed and planned. In order to allow sufficient time for review and feedback, please share your proposal with us at least six weeks before the submission deadline.
