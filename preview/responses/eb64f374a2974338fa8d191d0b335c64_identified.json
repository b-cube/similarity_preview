Thursday started with good news &#8211;\\ufffd\\ufffd EuroVelo routes occupied both 1st and 2nd place on the cycle route podium &#8211; and Friday followed suit. Here&#8217;s how we got on.</p> <p><span id=\"more-6947\"></span></p> <p>It&#8217;s not everyday that a\\ufffd\\ufffdEuroVelo route becomes the second most visited cycle route in the biggest cycling market in Europe but that\\ufffd\\ufffdis what just happened. According to the ADFC annual <a href=\"http://www.adfc.de/misc/filePush.php?mimeType=application/pdf&amp;fullPath=http://www.adfc.de/files/2/8/182/ADFC_Radreiseanalyse_2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>, \\ufffd\\ufffdEuroVelo 15, the <a href=\"http://www.rhinecycleroute.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">Rhine cycle route</a>, registered a significant growth (+3) in the last year and becomes, after the Danube route &#8211; EuroVelo 6, the consecrated champion &#8211; the second most visited cycle route in Europe.</p> <div id=\"attachment_6951\" style=\"width: 499px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-6951\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/adfc3.jpg\" alt=\"adfc3\" width=\"489\" height=\"304\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">ADFC Annual statistics report</p></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The efforts of our national coordinators in promoting EuroVelo at European and national level bore its fruit. Several EuroVelo routes: EuroVelo 6, EuroVelo 15&#8230; positioned themselves among the top international cycling tourism products. The ITB Berlin is one of the best\\ufffd\\ufffdplaces in the world to promote EuroVelo and cycling tourism. This year we focused our effort on EuroVelo 8, the Mediterranean route, EuroVelo 13, Iron Curtain Trail &#8211; both co financed by the European Commission DG ENTR &#8211; and EuroVelo 15,\\ufffd\\ufffdthe\\ufffd\\ufffdRhine Cycle Route &#8211; thanks to the support of our national and regional partners along the Rhine.</p> <p><img class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-6953\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/20150306_141043-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20150306_141043\" width=\"547\" height=\"311\" /></p> <p>Together with our partners from the three projects mentioned above, EuroVelo organised a panel dicussion on cycling tourism. The event attracted a good crowd thanks to the interventions of our panelists: Daniel Mourek (Environmental Partnership) EuroVelo13, Claudia Schwarz (Romantische Rhine Tourisme) EuroVelo 15 and Elettra Saccardi\\ufffd\\ufffd(Mantova Province) from EuroVelo 8.</p> <p><img class=\"  wp-image-6952 alignleft\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/panel.jpg\" alt=\"panel\" width=\"208\" height=\"147\" /></p> <p>The core of the discussion focused on\\ufffd\\ufffdhow to set up and maintain a successful\\ufffd\\ufffd&#8216;cycle tourism cycle&#8217; (see image). We saw examples of\\ufffd\\ufffdhow good services and quality infrastructure can bring more costumers and how their demand can in turn help shape the services that become available.\\ufffd\\ufffdWith a good attendance and crowd\\ufffd\\ufffdparticipation, the success of the panel discussion encouraged us to organise another at next year&#8217;s edition.</p> <p><em>&#8216;Cycling tourism is a booming business but it&#8217;s not only a business, the Iron Curtain Trail is an excellent example of how long distance cycle routes can connect people who were divided during the cold war and remind us of our common history&#8217;</em>\\ufffd\\ufffdsaid Daniel Mourek, EuroVelo 13</p> <p><em>&#8216;Without EuroVelo, the Rhine Cycle Route would have never become a successful transnational product&#8217;</em>\\ufffd\\ufffd added\\ufffd\\ufffdClaudia Schwarz, EuroVelo 15.</p> <p>But the ITB Berlin didn&#8217;t\\ufffd\\ufffdend there. During the weekend, the trade fair was open for the general public and the EuroVelo booth registered important peaks of visitors. During the 5 days at the ITB, the EuroVelo team met over 90 professionals at our booth, visited over 30 exhibitors, organised an event with over 30 attendees and did the groundwork for future collaboration with many stakeholders of the tourism sector.</p> <p>A few days ago we mentioned that cycling tourism was trending\\ufffd\\ufffdin the tourism market but we believe that EuroVelo can be the perfect tool for boosting cross-border tourism and can go as far as to offer the visibility required to attract visitors from beyond the European Union.</p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/03/06/eurovelo-at-the-itb-berlin-an-amazing-and-busy-start/\">  <title>EuroVelo at the ITB Berlin: an amazing and busy start!</title>  <link>http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/03/06/eurovelo-at-the-itb-berlin-an-amazing-and-busy-start/</link>  <dc:date>2015-03-06T08:54:37Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator><![CDATA[jesusf]]></dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Non class\\ufffd\\ufffd]]></dc:subject>  <description><![CDATA[Gr\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffde aus berlin!

Translated from the pages of the Domaines et R\\ufffd\\ufffdgions Cyclables <a href=\"http://www.departements-regions-cyclables.org/page/eurovelo-8--p-90.html\">website</a>, you can read up on the latest developments in the French approach to EuroVelo route creation. (image: Camille Perretta)</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span id=\"more-6919\"></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">On the 12<sup>th</sup> of February, more than 60 participants participated in the official launch of EuroVelo 8\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds national itinerary committee, organised by the Provence-Alpes-C\\ufffd\\ufffdte d\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAzur (PACA) region in the south-east of France. Jen-Yves Petit, the Vice-president for transport and eco-mobility confirmed that the region intends to take the lead in this process: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em>With EuroVelo 8, we are standing on our own two feet: infrastructure and tourism that is. That is why the Vice-president for tourism, Bernard Jaussaud, and myself are here together today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. </em>700km long, half of which is in the PACA and half in the Languedoc-Roussillon regions and 30% complete, EuroVelo 8 has much to do in order to go from an infrastructural project to a touristic offer. However, the interest in the project, the appeal of its itinerary and the attention to detail that this meeting was witness to made this launch a success that is full of promise for the future.</p> <div id=\"attachment_6922\" style=\"width: 456px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-6922\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/camille_perretta_400.jpg\" alt=\"camille_perretta_400\" width=\"446\" height=\"285\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Copyright: Camille Perretta</p></div> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>Public consultation, an inovation</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In the build up to the itinerary committee launch, the PACA region was doing some ground work; a first in the itinerary committee formation process in France. Over a period of six months, V\\ufffd\\ufffdlo Loisir Provence a local tourism promoter organised 8 events that served as platform for public consultation as well as getting the word out at a local level. The systematic and proactive participation of Jean-Yves Petit contributed to the successful turnout of these events: a total of 140 people attended and was met with a very positive response. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em>All those that live along the itinerary need to be involved in its realisation. The region is very committed to proximity tourism</em>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, explained Bernard Jaussaud.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><strong>The Mediterranean, a self-imposing identity</strong></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In the PACA region, EuroVelo 8 is 15% completed. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em>Having travelled it, I\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdve seen the EV8\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds huge potential for cycling tourism development</em>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd explained Alain Michel, AF3V delegate of the PACA region. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em>This axis has the potential to structure the region\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds touristic offerings, it links 5 regional national parks, some of which already offer cycling loops.</em>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Julien Savary, his counterpart in Languedoc-Roussillon, where the itinerary is 40% complete specified that \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em>for AF3V, an itinerary committee is great news as it will lead to a better final product. Our hope is that all the land use authorities in Languedoc-Roussillon commit to this committee and that it adopts an evocative and descriptive name as well as a logo in France</em>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. While a name has not yet been found, everybody was happy with including the words bicycle and Mediterranean.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Certain authorities had come prepared to involve themselves in the committee from the off. A date for the next meeting was set in order to allow the technical teams elaborate a detailed action plan, a budget and subsequently gather concrete commitments from the local authorities. Having established a project leader, a roadmap, convinced and enthusiastic partners at the different local levels, the launch of the EuroVelo 8 itinerary committee was a great success. And to remind us that the long distance routes not only support tourism, Andr\\ufffd\\ufffd Berger, president of V\\ufffd\\ufffdlo Loisir Provence, had the closing remarks: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em>To those who might have reservation about the benefits of such a project, it is not only the touristic returns that impress. What surprised me most of all is the appropriation of these cycle routes by locals. As soon as a section is completed, they are immediately made use of</em>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.</p> <div id=\"attachment_6923\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-6923 size-full\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/camille_perretta_400_2.jpg\" alt=\"camille_perretta_400_2\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Copyright: Camille Perretta</p></div> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/02/25/cycle-tourism-means-business/\">  <title>Cycle tourism means business</title>  <link>http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/02/25/cycle-tourism-means-business/</link>  <dc:date>2015-02-25T15:19:58Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator><![CDATA[jesusf]]></dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Non class\\ufffd\\ufffd]]></dc:subject>  <description><![CDATA[Cycle tourism gets more attention every time EuroVelo pays a visit to\\ufffd\\ufffdan international tourism trade fair in Europe.

It has the advantage of having wide streets that allow for cycle lanes and vehicles to coexist peacefully. But this aspect of the city\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds German urbanistic inheritance means that cycle lanes tend to be quite fragmented. In the 90s the city welcomed the tram but unlike in today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Cadiz (see last month\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <a href=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/01/23/eurovelo-8-and-public-transport-come-together-in-cadiz/\">article</a>) this didn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt facilitate the integration of a cycle network. Recently though, there has been an effort to promote cycling in the city and the urban area of Strasbourg has the most extensive cycle network in France. With its 530km of cycle lanes and with a growth of 10km every year, it looks to maintain its role as national leader. The modal share of cycling is as high as 15% in the city centre and the aim is to bring it up to 20% city-wide by 2020.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In a <a href=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2014/11/21/who-is-cycling-the-eurovelo-routes-french-region-of-alsace-has-a-closer-look/\">recent study</a> undertaken by Alsace a Velo which looked at who was using the cycle routes in the region. It showed that in general in the Alsace area, tourists only represented a fraction of those using the EuroVelo routes. With the number of cyclists per year using these routes estimated at nearly eight hundred thousand, the Strasbourg sections are by far the most popular in the area. The study highlighted the best represented group throughout the Alsace section of the route were local people on short term excursions. Another well represented group in Strasbourg were utility cyclists.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><img class=\"  wp-image-6863 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/AlsaceStudy_EN-e1424705384482-1024x584.png\" alt=\"AlsaceStudy_EN\" width=\"524\" height=\"302\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">One reason why excursions might figure so strongly in Strasbourg is the EuroVelo routes have been integrated into other, more local cycle offerings. A circuit of the city that visits the local historical forts, of which there are an impressive number, was recently set up. The route, known as the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<em><a href=\"http://www.strasbourg.eu/environnement-qualite-de-vie/deplacements/velo/piste-des-forts\">piste des forts</a></em>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, consists of 85km of cycle routes. It offers locals and tourists alike an itinerary on which to base a daily cycle tour. Sections of the circuit follow both EuroVelo routes as they approach the city.</p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/02/12/eurovelo-at-the-itb-berlin-2015-life/\">  <title>LIVE &#8211; EuroVelo at the ITB Berlin 2015</title>  <link>http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/02/12/eurovelo-at-the-itb-berlin-2015-life/</link>  <dc:date>2015-02-12T15:28:05Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator><![CDATA[jesusf]]></dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Non class\\ufffd\\ufffd]]></dc:subject>  <description><![CDATA[One more year, EuroVelo will be present at the ITB Berlin (hall 4.1. b booth no 217).

A lighthouse project of this scale has a clear international appeal. By captivating the imagination of an international audience it can bring people outside the typical cycle tourist profile around to cycle tourism and cycling more generally.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span id=\"more-6792\"></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The project is not only an attempt to change people\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds habits but makes financial sense too. According to the study \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe European cycle route network EuroVelo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd commissioned by the European Parliament, the southern section of the Iron Curtain Trail (ICT) is expected to generate 1.5 million daytrips, more than 170,000 holiday trips and have a total economic impact of 97.7 million Euro per year when it is fully developed. Bearing in mind that the cost of the core activities of the project are set to total 58.5 million Euro for the 2014 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 2020 period, it is an investment well worth making.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In order to fulfill this potential and appeal to an international audience, the services and highlights of the destination need to be made clear. While local tours do generally exist, they are often in local languages and lack the visibility required. The aim of the transnational offers is to increase the visibility and accessibility of the best of what local services have to offer. Put simply, a cycle tourist wants to know what services they will find before they get to the route. In order to attract that tourist, information on these proposals must be accessible to them (in a language they understand) and must appeal to them (at a scale they understand).</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The diversity of the landscapes that the ICT crosses brings certain challenges. Different sections of the route have very different levels of population density and economic development and some sections will have better infrastructure than others. As well as outlining what it is that the route has to offer, a transnational package gives extra coverage to the route which can reassure potential users.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><img class=\"  wp-image-6802 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/EV13-photo.jpg\" alt=\"EV13 photo\" width=\"526\" height=\"192\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">So, how was it done?</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">EuroVelo has been working on putting together a Transnational Action Plan (TAP) and developing transnational packages with international appeal. In both these projects, an attempt was made to establish a common methodology. It has provided a framework for coordinated action that involved many countries and can be used as a reference in future projects.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The goal of the Transnational Action Plan (TAP) was to give an overview of the current status of the EuroVelo 13 project, identify its aims and outline the strategies by which to fulfill them. It\\ufffd\\ufffdfocused on five areas that are central to the success of the project: infrastructure, services, marketing &amp; promotion, and organising &amp; financing. In the document, we propose the following:</p> <ul> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">The construction of\\ufffd\\ufffd304 km of new segregated cycle paths and 692 km of cycle lanes along main carriageways, whilst 207 km of surface improvements are needed for roads, mainly for cyclists.</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">In order to reduce costs and improve road safety, we proposed soft route development measures (shared lane marking and traffic calming / reduction) on 231 km of the route. The improvement of the quality of the low traffic public roads is necessary on 107 km.</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">We defined 70 separate sections for the southern part of the Iron Curtain Trail. The length of the sections vary (between 12.5 and 92 km) and we want to be sure that there basic accommodation is available\\ufffd\\ufffdat least at the end of the daily sections. Unfortunately 17 sections in various rural stage of the route do not fulfil this basic criterion (of which 7 are placed in Serbia and 4 in Bulgaria), so,\\ufffd\\ufffdamongst other measures, we propose to develop basic accommodation on 10 of them.</li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">To provide better services, especially for cyclists, we proposed to make\\ufffd\\ufffdthe service points\\ufffd\\ufffdcycle friendly in every country and introduce label and quality insurances in those countries which do not yet have a national system.<img class=\"  wp-image-6803 alignright\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Hungary.jpg\" alt=\"Hungary\" width=\"275\" height=\"208\" /></li> <li style=\"text-align: justify\">To reach and convince our target groups we have to integrate the Iron Curtain Trail to\\ufffd\\ufffdtrans-national (EuroVelo), national, regional and local promotional activities and offers and we need new marketing and promotional material\\ufffd\\ufffd(websites, printed promotion tools, events, study tours). The organisational solutions are the key to the sustainability of every long distance cycle route project. Besides awareness raising and training, we propose steering and working groups.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">In parallel to putting together the TAP, the EuroVelo team has been working closely with local partners to set up coherent packages at the transnational level targeted at an international audience. It has resulted in the submission of seven different transnational packages between Bratislava in Slovakia to Edirne in Turkey.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The first step was for local, regional, national packages to be submitted. These were either transport or tourism offers and highlighted which services most needed to be developed and promoted. After that, an evaluation was carried out to establish which of these initial offers were best suited to be integrated into a transnational offer. The proposals were mapped based on the itinerary outlined in the submissions. It was observed that there was a concentration of proposals along two sections of the ICT South. A classification of the submissions was made based on whether they constituted a touristic or a transport offer. It was also noted whether the proposals designated a specific operator and whether the proposals were at an idea stage or at a realisation stage.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><img class=\"  wp-image-6804 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/romania.jpg\" alt=\"romania\" width=\"535\" height=\"360\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Three different levels of cooperation among the tourism providers were identified. The first, most basic level of cooperation is that of mutual promotion. The participating partners may promote each other by providing linked recommendations on the tour websites and promotional material on the ground. The second level involves setting up a voucher system where mutual discounts of between 5% and 10% are offered based on previous participation in a partner tour. The final level of cooperation is to incorporate both tours into one offer. Modifying the original proposals to maximise complementarity or continuity can be envisaged.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Once the seven proposed transnational packages were put together, they were resubmitted to the local partners. The format, distance and duration of the various packages were of the same order. The next step will require close collaboration between the partners in order to identify an appropriate operator and bring the package to the market.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><a class=\"file_link file_link_pdf\" href=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/TAP-EV13S.pdf\">Transnational Action Programme</a></p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/01/29/eurovelo-at-the-worlds-leading-travel-trade-show/\">  <title>EuroVelo at the world&#8217;s leading travel trade show</title>  <link>http://www.eurovelo.org/news/2015/01/29/eurovelo-at-the-worlds-leading-travel-trade-show/</link>  <dc:date>2015-01-29T10:36:36Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator><![CDATA[ecf_ed]]></dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Non class\\ufffd\\ufffd]]></dc:subject>  <description><![CDATA[After the success of our previous visits, EuroVelo will be returning to the ITB Berlin next month where we will be particularly highlighting EuroVelo 8 &#8211; Mediterranean Route, EuroVelo 13 &#8211; Iron Curtain Trail and EuroVelo 15 &#8211; Rhine Route.

You are not alone. The SEEMORE project has been making traditional holiday destinations more cycle friendly. Sometimes, solutions can be very simple. The weapon of choice was persuasion and the good results are yet another example of how cycling just makes sense.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><span id=\"more-6658\"></span></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The 14 project partners covered 8 coastal tourist destinations in Europe. By targeting established destinations, the project aimed at adapting existing infrastructure to make it more cycle-friendly. Co-funded by the EU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Intelligent Energy Europe Programme, the SEEMORE project targeted \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsoft measures\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in order to foster more awareness and interest in cycling among visitors. The goals of the project, which covered the 2012 to 2015 period, were the following:</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Increase visitors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd awareness of sustainable mobility;<br /> \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Strengthen the co-operation between the mobility and tourism sectors;<br /> \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Shift travel behaviour of tourists to sustainable transport modes;<br /> \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Communicate and transfer experiences to other tourist regions.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6735\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/seemore21.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"527\" height=\"420\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">The focus was on ways of promoting cycling through soft measures such as information and communication campaigns. Infrastructural investments can often be seen as the main way of promoting cycling and while they are essential to a good cycling environment, they are not the only way of promoting cycling. The SEEMORE project found five \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsoft\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ways of effectively doing so: increasing bicycle rental in hotels, introducing bicycle sharing schemes, availability of cycling tours, making public transport links bicycle friendly and the introduction of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbike &amp; bed\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd quality labels. The project also saw some complimentary infrastructure and services being established in Dobrich (Bulgaria) and Bohusl\\ufffd\\ufffdn (Sweden).</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">One very simple but effective way of getting tourists on saddles is by providing them with bicycles. The partners targeted the hotels with an information campaign that aimed to show that, by offering bicycles, they provide an additional service that is very often appreciated. In order to gage the effect that the provision of bicycles by hotels would have among tourists, a baseline study was carried out. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that the demand for this sort of service already existed among the tourists. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdBike &amp; bed\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd quality labels were also introduced in Pomerania for accommodation that was equipped for hosting bicycles. In addition to accommodation-based bicycle provision, steps were also taken towards setting up or expanding bicycle sharing schemes in Dobrich, Limassol and Malta.</p> <p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-6728 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/bike-sharing2_Limassol.png\" alt=\"bike sharing2_Limassol\" width=\"475\" height=\"316\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">Additional measures set out to make existing infrastructures bicycle-friendly. Facilitating the transport of bicycles on public transport helped make cycling easier and more attractive to tourists. Here, the partners took on the task of lobbying the relevant public transport authorities. By targeting political support for their proposals to incorporate bicycle transport on existing public transport lines, successful campaigns were undertaken in Bohusl\\ufffd\\ufffdn (train line) and Malta (bus network). Guided tours also proved effective in promoting the use of bicycles among tourists. This was particularly effective in Limassol, where a number of operators set up tours and a free weekly \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFriday Night Bike\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd event was set up which attracted each time between 100 and 140 participants throughout the year 2013.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-6731\" src=\"http://www.eurovelo.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Friday-Night-Bike3.png\" alt=\"Friday Night Bike3\" width=\"527\" height=\"347\" /></p> <p style=\"text-align: justify\">By bringing together actors from both the tourism and transport sectors, the project aimed to stimulate a more comprehensive assessment and find practical solutions for all. This involved facilitating communication on practical and technical issues. An imaginative, problem-solving approach was adopted which resulted in relatively cheap measures being implemented that, in many cases, had benefits for both tourists and locals.
