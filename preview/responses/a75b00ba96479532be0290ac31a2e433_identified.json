Data are derived from California Office of Drinking Water (ODW) Water Quality Monitoring Database (WQMD; also know as Water Quality Inventory or WQI), Safe Drinking Water System (SDWIS), and Permits, Inspection, Compliance, Monitoring, and Enforcement (PICME) database. The data set contains one record for each year and Community Water System (CWS) that was active for all or part of the reporting period. It includes additional detail about how many retail connections by each CWS, how many people are served by each CWS, and the approximate location of each CWS.</abstract> <purpose>This data set contributes to the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The EPHT cooperative agreement states that all grantees must track and make available core environmental health tracking measures on the State and National EPHT Network, including data/information on key drinking water contaminants for regulated public water supplies, as defined through the Content workgroup process. The Content Workgroup Water Team identified contaminants of concern for the national EPHT program, identified nationally consistent data sources, and developed nationally consistent indicators and measures. This data set can be used to enumerate all Community Water Systems in California. Using the Public Water System ID Number, it can be joined with the sampling results dataset.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19990101</begdate> <begtime/> <enddate>20121231</enddate> <endtime/> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Once per year</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.409721</westbc> <eastbc>-114.131208</eastbc> <northbc>42.009521999999997</northbc> <southbc>32.53416</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>NONE</themekt> <themekey>hazard</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt/> <placekey>California,CA,06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>none</accconst> <useconst>The geographic locations provided in this dataset were not verified for accuracy by State Primacy Agency officers or water system staff.

WQMD, SDWIS, and PICME are coded logically to reasonably ascertain active CWS for the reporting period, however, a small minority of active CWS only export drinking water to other CWS with a non-zero retail population. For this reason, the legal definition (i.e. serving 15 retail connections or 25 people, year-round) of a CWS was also used in populating the CWS inventory. 3363 total CWS were enumerated by this logic for the reporting period.&#13; &#13; The SDWIS inventory deactivation date of each system that is currently inactive allows for the inclusion of water systems that were formerly active during earlier years of the reporting period. In previous years' inventory datasets, only the inventory of the most recent year was extracted. Listed below are the annual frequencies of active systems included in this dataset.&#13; &#13; Year -- Num Systems&#13; 1999 -- 3,059&#13; 2000 -- 3,080&#13; 2001 -- 3,071&#13; 2002 -- 3,063&#13; 2003 -- 3,055&#13; 2004 -- 3,044&#13; 2005 -- 3,039&#13; 2006 -- 3,035&#13; 2007 -- 3,017&#13; 2008 -- 3,030&#13; 2009 -- 3,036&#13; 2010 -- 3,016&#13; 2011 -- 3,001&#13; 2012 -- 2,987&#13; &#13; CWS-specific population-served estimates are often inaccurate, because individual water systems are given 3 options for performing this calculation:  1. using the US Census and/or CA Department of Finance, 2, multiplying the number of service connections by 3.3, and/or 3. estimating the population served for single connections that provide service to multiple dwelling establishments, such as mobile home parks, apartments, prisons, and other institutional facilities with permanent residents.  As of September 2, 2012, according to PICME and reported through this dataset, the total 2012 active CWS population served was 41,012,626, whereas the US Census reports the CA population in 2012 as 38,041,430. Moreover, estimates of public drinking water use by USGS and from the 1990 Census found that only 85-90% of the CA population is served by CWS. Statewide, this means that the population served estimate as reported by this dataset may be 20-25% higher than the true value.&#13;&#13; Latitude and longitude coordinates to describe a representative location for CWS were found using 5 methods in the following priority: 1. centroid of service area polygon (LocationDerivationCode=SA), 2. centroid of facility coordinate locations expected to be near the service area (LocationDerivationCode=MFL), 3. centroid of principal city served coordinates and geocoded system headquarters address point (LocationDerivationCode=0), 4. principal city served coordinates (LocationDerivationCode=PCS), 5.  geocoded system headquarters address point (LocationDerivationCode=GSH).  The logic used for subsetting sampling station locations that are expected to be near retail populations was as follows: any active or combination groundwater sampling location (raw, treated, or untreated) was considered to be near the retail population served. Typically, groundwater systems lie in or very near the consuming population. For active, mixed and surface water sampling locations, only treatment plant sampling stations and distribution system sampling locations were used.  Annual frequencies for distribution of how locations were found are listed below:&#13;&#13; 1999 -- SA=1,312; MFL=1,556; O=130; PCS=48; GSH=8; -999=5&#13; 2000 -- SA=1,319; MFL=1,565; O=136; PCS=48; GSH=8; -999=4&#13; 2001 -- SA=1,329; MFL=1,554; O=123; PCS=51; GSH=10; -999=4&#13; 2002 -- SA=1,348; MFL=1,544; O=116; PCS=47; GSH=5; -999=3&#13; 2003 -- SA=1,350; MFL=1,530; O=116; PCS=50; GSH=6; -999=3&#13; 2004 -- SA=1,357; MFL=1,510; O=117; PCS=50; GSH=7; -999=3&#13; 2005 -- SA=1,366; MFL=1,493; O=119; PCS=51; GSH=7; -999=3&#13; 2006 -- SA=1,371; MFL=1,482; O=119; PCS=53; GSH=7; -999=3&#13; 2007 -- SA=1,377; MFL=1,468; O=116; PCS=46; GSH=7; -999=3&#13; 2008 -- SA=1,388; MFL=1,458; O=125; PCS=48; GSH=6; -999=5&#13; 2009 -- SA=1,398; MFL=1,445; O=134; PCS=49; GSH=6; -999=4&#13; 2010 -- SA=1,398; MFL=1,430; O=132; PCS=46; GSH=6; -999=4&#13; 2011 -- SA=1,394; MFL=1,416; O=134; PCS=47; GSH=6; -999=4&#13; 2012 -- SA=1,387; MFL=1,409; O=134; PCS=47; GSH=6; -999=4&#13; </logic> <complete>By definition, this dataset does not include unregulated drinking water providers or systems not defined as Community Water Systems according the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, namely private drinking water wells or very small systems (\"State Small\") or mutuals in which there are less than 15 retail connections and less than 25 year-round residents.&#13;&#13; Latitude and longitude values could not be found for 7 CWS over the entire reporting period; This CWS was coded as missing -999. </complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>CEHTP received comma-separated (CSV) PICME database from ODW (dated 9/2/2012) and imported SYSNUM1 (N=14398) table into SQL Server 2008.
