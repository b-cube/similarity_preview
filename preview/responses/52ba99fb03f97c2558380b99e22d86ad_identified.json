The objective of the buyback was to assist fishermen transition to other gears while the ban sought to protect parrotfish populations, reduce by-catch and minimize gear-habitat interactions. The analysis drew from 43 individuals knowledgeable about the buyback and ban process, including commercial fishermen, recreational diving and fishing charter operators, members of non-governmental environmental organizations, and professionals involved in resource management, research and outreach. Overall, the results underscored a perception gap between former net fishermen and other stakeholder groups, especially when dealing with biological and socio-economic impacts of the ban. Survey results showed that former net fishermen and a slight majority of the resource managers believed that buyback payments were insufficient to transition to other gears, especially traps, whereas members of the diving, charter, and environmental group disagreed. On average, fishermen received less than one-fifth of the amount that they deemed reasonable to start a new operation. Most fishermen believed that the net ban had increased the protection of parrotfish; however, resource managers were more guarded due to the absence of independent biological studies. The diving, charter and environmental group was skeptical about increases in parrotfish abundance. Fishermen and, to lesser extent resource managers, felt the ban adversely impacted the profitability of fishing operations and fishermen's livelihoods. Out of the original nine net fishermen bought out, only five remained owner operators.\" </Abstract>  <Keywords>Gillnet, trammel net, buyback, ban, St. Croix, socio-economic </Keywords>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20131113000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/project/455/CRCP_Agar_GTBuybackandBan_08_19_13.pdf </URL>  <project>  <ID>456 </ID>  <title>SocioEconomic Assessment of the St. Croix Gill and Trammel Net Ban </title>  <PI>Juan Agar </PI>  </project>  <Region>USVI </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-64.435020 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>-65.205180 </Westbc>  <Southbc>17.543930 </Southbc>  <Northbc>18.533300 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>techreport </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>techreport </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
