It was organised by Professors Ruth Towse and Martin Kretschmer as a cooperative initiative between the Centre for IP Policy and Management at BU and CREATe, University of Glasgow with the aim of exploring the concept of evidence as employed in copyright policy making, and challenge the concept from a social science perspective. The aim was to produce an orientation point in the contested debate about &amp;lsquo;evidence-based&amp;rsquo; copyright reform. A web resource offers transcripts and short videos of the discussion, an introductory essay, and a bibliography: (http://www.copyrightevidence.org/create/esrc_evidence_symposium)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Symposium took the form of four panels with specific professional and disciplinary groups: policy-makers, stakeholders, social scientists and law professors with an open session to enable wider audience participation. Each panel speaker was asked to give a short opening statement, setting out what constitutes evidence from their disciplinary perspective, using the UK Intellectual Property Office&amp;rsquo;s guidance document on standards of evidence (&amp;lsquo;clear, verifiable and able to be peer-reviewed&amp;rsquo;) as a starting point for their contribution.&lt;/p&gt;

It will begin with a critical assessment of the current parameters of the UK copyright regime as it applies to the work of archivists, including recommendations for reform that have followed in the wake of the Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (2006-2010), the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth (2010-2011), the recent Consultation on Copyright (2011-12), as well as the government&amp;rsquo;s response thereto: Modernising Copyright (2012). It considers the various problems the copyright regime presents for archives undertaking mass digitisation projects as well as recent European and UK initiatives in this domain. It argues that the UK copyright regime, even when read in conjunction with current national and regional recommendations for reform, falls short of delivering a legal framework that would enable archivists to realise the full potential that comprehensive, universal online access to the country&amp;rsquo;s archival holdings would contribute to local and national democracy and accountability, to education, learning, and culture, and to the sense of identity and place for local people, communities and organisations. Ultimately, a case is made for the differential treatment of archives within the copyright regime &amp;ndash; different, that is, from libraries and other related institutions operating within the cultural sector. The paper concludes with a policy recommendation that would greatly enhance the ability of archives to provide online access to their holdings, while at the same time safeguarding the economic interests of the authors and owners of copyright-protected work.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8374</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-06T16:03:38Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-create</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Erickson, Kris</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Kretschmer, Martin</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Mendis, Dinusha</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Copyright and the Economic Effects of Parody: An empirical study of music videos on the YouTube platform, and an assessment of regulatory options</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-03-18</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8374</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.8374</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third in a sequence of three reports on Parody &amp;amp; Pastiche, commissioned to evaluate policy options in the implementation of the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property &amp;amp; Growth (2011). Study I presents new empirical data about music video parodies on the online platform YouTube; Study II offers a comparative legal review of the law of parody in seven jurisdictions; Study III provides a summary of the findings of Studies I &amp;amp; II, and analyses their relevance for copyright policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Links to all three studies are available from&lt;br /&gt; http://www.ipo.gov.uk/pro-ipresearch/ipresearch-year/ipresearch-year-2013.htm&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Study III is structured as follows:&lt;br /&gt; First, we discuss the empirical findings from Study I. A sample of 8,299 user-generated music video parodies was constructed relating to the top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011.&amp;nbsp;The key findings are:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Parody is a signifi cant consumer activity: On average, there are 24 user-generated parodies available for each original video of a charting single.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;There is no evidence for economic damage to rights holders through substitution: The presence of parody content is correlated with, and predicts larger audiences for original music videos.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;The potential for reputational harm in the observed sample is limited: Only 1.5% of all parodies sampled took a directly negative stance, discouraging viewers from commercially supporting the original.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Observed creative contributions were considerable: In 78% of all cases, the parodist appeared on camera (also diminishing the possibility of confusion).&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;There exists a small but growing market for skilled user-generated parody: Parodists who exhibit higher production values in their works attract larger audiences, which can be monetized via revenue share with YouTube.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Secondly, we present a distilled discussion of the legal treatment of parodies in seven jurisdictions that have implemented a copyright exception for parody (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and USA). The underlying principles (including economic and constitutional) governing divergent legal approaches are identified, and a list of policy options is presented.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Thirdly, we provide a synthesis of the legal analysis and the empirical data. Each of the policy options identified in Study II is examined for its likely impact on the empirical sample gathered in Study I. Finally, some recommendations are made.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8375</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-06T16:03:44Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-create</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Edwards, Lilian</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Harbinja, Edina</dc:creator>   <dc:title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWhat happens to my Facebook profile when I die?\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd : Legal Issues Around Transmission of Digital Assets on Death</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-05-20</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8375</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.8375</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;This chapter aims to explore some of the major legal issues pertaining to transmission of digital assets on death. &amp;ldquo;Digital assets&amp;rdquo; within this chapter are defined widely and not exclusively to include a huge range of intangible information goods associated with the online or digital world: including social network profiles e.g. on Facebook, Twitter, Google + or Linked In; emails, tweets, databases etc; in-game virtual assets (e.g., as bought, found or built in worlds such as Second Life, World of Warcraft, Lineage, etc); digitised text, image, music or sound, such as video, film and e-book files; passwords to various accounts associated with provisions of digital goods and services, either as buyer, user or trader (e.g. to eBay, Amazon, Facebook, YouTube etc); domain names; 2D or 3D personality-related images or icons such as user icons on LiveJournal or avatars in Second Life; and not excluding the myriad types of digital assets emergent as commodities capable of being assigned worth (e.g. &amp;ldquo;zero day exploits&amp;rdquo; or bugs in software which antagonists can exploit[1]).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In emerging legal discourse, disputes over digital assets on death can be usefully divided as related to either their pure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;economic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;value, or what might be called their dignitary, personal or&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;non-economic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;value. Domain names, for example are an obvious example of an economic asset which may be crucial to the branding and thus the profitability of a business. In a family business, not only who inherits the domain name itself, but also who gets the email notifying of the upcoming need to re-register, may be controversial issues. Similarly many outlet businesses nowadays operate exclusively from eBay and, again, who inherits that account (i.e. the password and login), the money attached to the account, and any connected ongoing auctions will be a serious matter. Virtual assets in game worlds often represent the fruit of thousands of hours of labour (if game playing can be called labour[2]) and there is already a substantial ethical and legal literature around their value, sale and conditions for transferability[3]. Photos, blogs and text (e.g. spontaneous poems) within social network profiles by celebrities &amp;ndash; or those who die and later become famous &amp;ndash; are likely soon to be of economic value, just as author&amp;rsquo;s letters and unpublished novels[4]are today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But such assets may also be of what one might call sentimental value. Millions of photos exist on Flickr, Picasa, etc which are of very little value to anyone but the accountholder&amp;rsquo;s immediate friends and family &amp;ndash; but to them they may be priceless. Similarly, access to the emails of a deceased family member may be of desperate importance to the bereaved, and this issue more than any has sparked public and legislative attention to the issue of digital assets, intermediary platforms and death (see below, sec. B, p. 6). Another crucial modern phenomenon is the trend towards &amp;ldquo;memorialisation&amp;rdquo; of social network profiles on Facebook and the like[5]; effectively turning them into shrines to the memory of the deceased, where friends leave last messages and other friends gather to read them. In such cases, although money is not (usually) the issue, emotions can run very high and conflicts develop (do the friends or the parents decide if the profile is memorialised? What if the profile tells people something about the deceased the parents would rather suppress e.g. homosexuality, atheism, suicide?) and the first litigation relating to access to, and possession of, social network profiles is also beginning to percolate through[6].&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Finally it is worth noting that society in general as well as specific heirs, family and friends has an interest in the legacy of the dead; e.g. authors&amp;rsquo; letters (or emails, or blogs) have value to historians, scholars and critics as well as a market value to collectors. The range of stakeholders involved&amp;nbsp; in digital assets cases is thus disparate and by no means limited to those in a contractual relationship with service providers[7].&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In all types of cases, the legal issues around access, control, ownership and transmission are complex, and worse still, such answers as there are may vary considerably from legal system to legal system. It is important to note the law does not start here from a blank canvas. To some extent, existing laws will already partially regulate the issues. Almost all legal systems have rules relating to the transmission of property on death, under the name of wills and testaments law, succession, probate etc. Succession law is usually divided into what the law says when a will has been made by the deceased (testacy) and what happens when no will exists (intestacy). The law regulating the procedure to wind up the deceased&amp;rsquo;s estate &amp;ndash; the ingathering and distribution of assets to heirs or legatees &amp;ndash; is a separate branch of law again, usually called executry or administration. Unhelpfully, succession laws tend to be very localised -&amp;nbsp; e.g. the substantive laws relating to transmission of assets on death vary wildly even between, say, the various United States, England and Wales, and Scotland,&amp;nbsp; which are at least all three common law jurisdictions (though Scotland has considerable civilian influence). Civilian legal systems (eg as found in the nations of Continental Europe, Latin America, Louisiana, Quebec and Japan) differ even further. These differences matter: in one system, the spouse of the deceased may inherit or have the right to occupy the family home no matter what a will says &amp;ndash; in others, the will may reign triumphant. In some systems, step-children may inherit nothing on intestacy, while in others they may be equal to full-blood children. Some attempts have been made to harmonise a few aspects of succession law globally &amp;ndash; e.g. as discussed below, the laws on recognition of grants of administration obtained abroad in relation to assets in the local jurisdiction &amp;ndash; but very little of the basic substantive law has been globally harmonised. As we shall see later, this means difficult jurisdictional problems are likely to arise in the nature of digital assets , for example, if an English person dies in England but with a profile on Facebook, a company whose HQ is in California but whose servers may be distributed globally. We touch briefly on this issue at section E.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The key question is how far digital assets fit well into these existing legal paradigms, complex as they are, and whether new law is needed. Two preliminary issues complicate the matter. First, in general, assets only fall into the estate of a deceased if they are &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;property&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Property law, like succession law, is a well-established and ancient branch of private law. It has also been annotated by more modern legal conceptions including intellectual property (IP) law, data protection (DP) law, privacy law and information law. Property is most often recognisable as to what transmits on death. It has restrictions. In most systems, not all things we may want, or think we own, are property, although where the line is drawn is one of the most difficult issues in private law. Some items cannot be owned as they belong to all of us: the air and the high seas are usually in this category. More relevantly to digital assets, some items are too evanescent to be property. The hope of a future gain &amp;ndash; e.g. an option to buy future stock, held by an employee when they die &amp;ndash; may or may not convert into an item in their probate inventory, depending on the legal system and the exact details. The same may apply to a future right to sue on behalf of the deceased if he or she was libelled or wronged or dismissed from employment without cause during their lifetime. In many legal systems, such claims are viewed as personal to the deceased and title to sue in such cases dies with the wronged person and will not transmit to their heirs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some licences &amp;ndash; contractual rights to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;use,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;as are commonly &amp;ldquo;sold&amp;rdquo; in relation to digital music or intellectual property (IP) in general &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; are explicitly given only for limited periods of time &amp;ndash; which may mean they expire on death (or earlier) and so do not form part of the estate of the deceased. This point is very relevant to inheritance of MP3s downloaded from e.g. iTunes, or e-books downloaded to a Kindle. Finally, some assets are so novel it is simply hard to tell if they can be categorised as property, even if regularly &amp;ldquo;sold&amp;rdquo; or valued,&amp;nbsp; and if so, what kind of property. The &amp;ldquo;zero day exploits&amp;rdquo; mentioned above may fall into this character, as might be on-line reputations e.g. the &amp;ldquo;karma&amp;rdquo; on Slashdot of a commenter, or a trader&amp;rsquo;s cumulative rating on eBay. We discuss some of these problems below, using emails and MP3s bought from iTunes as illustrative examples.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The second key complication is that many important digital assets are controlled, both practically and legally, by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;intermediaries&lt;/em&gt;. This is true in the offline world as well sometimes &amp;ndash; e.g. access to a bank account is controlled by the bank when the user dies &amp;ndash; but it is much less common than in the online world. Access to Facebook profiles, for example, is entirely controlled by Facebook. A user cannot set up a profile there without entering a contract with Facebook. This contract is usually formed when a user clicks &amp;ldquo;I accept&amp;rdquo; or similar, and is therefore deemed to have read and accepted the terms and conditions set by Facebook. (Such agreements &amp;ndash; whether known as &amp;ldquo;end user license agreements&amp;rdquo; or EULAs (as is common in games and virtual worlds); or terms and conditions (T&amp;amp;C); or Acceptable Use and Privacy Policies are all basically legal contracts.) When the user dies, control of the profile is still effectively with Facebook. They can close or delete or memorialise the profile, according to their own internal rules or norms, while the heirs may not even be able to read it if they are not FB users, or even if they are if they were not &amp;ldquo;Friends&amp;rdquo; with the deceased (and how many young people have their mother, say, as a Friend on Facebook?) Legally as far as Facebook is concerned, the relationship between them and the user, even after death, is primarily regulated by contract. The contract may simply not contain any rules on what happens on death &amp;ndash; Facebook do give some insight into their internal rules[8]&amp;nbsp;but many service provider contracts are simply blank on the matter, which may mean disputes are left to the discretion of abuse teams, or similar.&amp;nbsp; Even where rules do exist though, there is a patent potential for conflict on death between the rules of contract and the rules of succession/executry. This major problem was first explored in case law in the celebrated&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ellsworth&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and Yahoo!&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;case, discussed in full below at section B.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A connected and less often aired problem is that contract rules are a matter of private bargaining not social policy. While inheritance laws may have evolved to try to balance the interests of, say, parents and spouse of the deceased, or spouse and best friend, or even society (e.g.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;ultimus haeres&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;rules) , contract is unlikely to think about the public good or what value society places on family ties. This is particularly true in the context of social network or most online service contracts which are usually (as they say in consumer law) standard form contracts dictated to the user with significant imbalance of power and lack of opportunity to negotiate. In plain English, this mean that users rarely read the contracts they &amp;ldquo;sign&amp;rdquo; with online service providers and have no power to alter them even if they did; thus they are likely not to reflect their real wishes on death but merely what is commercially best for the service provider. There is often a lack of transparency as to what the service provider&amp;rsquo;s rules are, and a lack of consistency as to what the rules are from one service provider to another. This is why it is quite probable that what terms if any social network providers state about transmission of user accounts may well clash with the general law of succession; and that users are likely to have no idea what happens to their profiles etc when they die.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Given the complexities described above, this chapter will mainly draw comparatively on the laws of the US and England and Wales, with a few references where relevant to EU law. In general as a matter of private law, succession and property laws in the EU are a matter for national law. Some harmonised EU law, e.g. data protection law, is however relevant. Similarly in the US, succession law is largely a state not federal matter.&amp;nbsp; As already noted, the lack of international (or often even national) harmonisation in this area is a particularly acute problem when talking about &amp;ldquo;globalised&amp;rdquo; or delocalised assets such as tweets or Facebook profiles. Another key problem is the simple novelty of the area, meaning there is a lack of legal precedent as well as good practice among solicitors/lawyers. &amp;nbsp;Part of the plan for future Edwards/Harbinja research is to provide a one-stop shop guide for users and lawyers seeking guidance on devolution of particular digital assets on death.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[1]&amp;nbsp;Edwards L&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Law and the Internet&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(3rd&amp;nbsp;edn, Hart, 2009), ch 21, pp 687-690.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[2]&amp;nbsp;Playing games as piecework to create commercially transferable assets (or levels of play) is often called gold-farming, and usually done by developing world players on low wages to sell to time-poor developed world players.

Recent EC and UN initiatives have begun to suggest an increased role for corporations as protectors of human rights. But, as yet, binding rather than voluntary obligations of this kind under international human rights law seem either non-existent or highly conflicted, and structural limitations to such a shift may currently exist under both US and UK law. Companies do not face decisions regarding disclosure in a vacuum, rather they face them constrained by existing obligations under (sometimes conflicting) legal demands. Yet, companies such as Twitter are well-positioned to be advocates for consumers&amp;rsquo; interests in these legal debates. Using several recent corporate disclosure decisions regarding user identity as illustration, this paper places questions of privacy, free speech and disclosure in broader legal context. More scholarship is needed on the mechanics of how online intermediaries, especially social media, manage their position as crucial speech platforms in democratic as well as less democratic regimes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories and Subject Descriptors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Security &amp;ndash; pseudonymity, anonymity and untraceability; Human centered computing &amp;ndash; social networks, privacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Standardization, Security, Human Factors, Legal Aspects.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Social networks, Twitter, pseudonymity, anonymity, privacy&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8377</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-06T16:03:53Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-create</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Favale, Marcella</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Homberg, Fabian</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Kretschmer, Martin</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Mendis, Dinusha</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Secchi, Davide</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Copyright, and the Regulation of Orphan Works: A comparative review of seven jurisdictions and a rights clearance simulation</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-07-03</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8377</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.8377</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This report is a collaboration between the Centre for Intellectual Property Policy &amp;amp; Management (www.cippm.org.uk), Bournemouth University (BU), the Department for Human Resources &amp;amp; Organisational Behaviour, The Business School, BU, and CREATe, the RCUK Centre for Copyright &amp;amp; New Business Models (www.create.ac.uk).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Hargreaves Review stated: &amp;ldquo;The problem of orphan works &amp;ndash; works to which access is effectively barred because the copyright holder cannot be traced &amp;ndash; represents the starkest failure of the copyright framework to adapt.&amp;rdquo; (Digital Opportunity: A Review of Intellectual Property and Growth; London: Intellectual Property Office; 2011; p. 38).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This report was commissioned by the Intellectual Property Office to support the implementation of the Hargreaves Review. It aims to offer a clearer understanding of how orphan works are regulated and priced in other jurisdictions, and how a pricing system could be structured to ensure that &amp;ldquo;parents&amp;rdquo; are fairly remunerated if they re-appear, and users are incentivised to access and exploit registered orphan works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Orphan works&amp;rsquo; are works in which copyright still subsists, but where the rightholder, whether it be the creator of the work or successor in title, cannot be located.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This report was commissioned to assist the UK government in evaluating policy options in the implementation of the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property &amp;amp; Growth (2011) to enable and price the use of orphan works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The research proceeded in two stages. Study I undertook a comparative international review of actual or proposed orphan works legislation, and identified key characteristics of orphan works licensing schemes. Study II investigated the potential effects of such schemes by conducting a simulated rights clearance exercise for six scenarios (establishing licence terms and fees for specific commercial and non-commercial uses), and analysing the resulting dataset for effects of the characteristics identified in Study I.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I. Comparative Review&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The comparative review relied on a close scrutiny of actual or proposed legislation and considered government reports, draft bills, publications and other commentaries on the orphan works issue. The countries reviewed included jurisdictions with operational orphan works regulations: Canada, Denmark, Hungary, India, and Japan; as well as provisions at the EU level and in the US (draft legislation and current practice). The purpose of the review was to identify key features of legal regimes with respect to factors such as &amp;ndash; (i) categories of works covered; (ii) standards of diligent search; (iii) the mechanism for obtaining permission; (iv) the existence of a register or database of recording suspected orphan works; (v) the role of collecting societies;(vi) tariffs set by category of work; (vii) mechanisms for challenging tariffs; (viii) remedies for reappearing authors and case law, if any, on damages for infringing use.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Findings Study I:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(1) Two distinct approaches appear to be used for governing orphan works in the jurisdictions reviewed. The first may be labelled &amp;lsquo;ex-ante&amp;rsquo;, and involves rights clearing before a work is used, the second is &amp;lsquo;ex-post&amp;rsquo; and typically involves the management of infringement risks by the user.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the former an applicant is required to engage with an authorising body or collecting society in order to receive a licence to make use of an orphan work. In contrast, the latter involves either the creation of a statutory copyright exception, or a limitation of liability where an applicant makes use of an orphan work after having exerted some effort to identify the potential rightholder (e.g. diligent search, attribution). These regimes provide different levels of protection for authors and users.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The ex-ante approach is exemplified by Canada, Japan and India where a potential user has to discuss terms with a copyright board. In ex-post systems payment is only due in case an author reappears. This approach is exemplified by the US. The analysis shows a strong protection for rightholders, both ex ante and ex post, in India, and Japan; and a relatively lower protection in the US, and to a certain extent Denmark (under the system of Extended Collective Licensing). Canada and Hungary are intermediate cases (e.g. no advertising requirements prior to use, but public listing of granted licences).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(2) While most jurisdictions require a diligent search to be conducted by the applicant there is no uniform standard constituting a diligent search. Across jurisdictions the specifications for diligent search vary considerably. Requirements involving the preventive search of the author range from the weak provisions of Denmark (no search required), Canada (requiring &amp;ldquo;reasonable effort&amp;rdquo;), and the US (&amp;ldquo;reasonable search&amp;rdquo; required) to the strong provisions of India, Japan, Hungary and the EU (but not France) providing a duty for the user of performing a &amp;ldquo;diligent search&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;due diligence search&amp;rdquo; (India) accompanied by some form of record tracking of the steps performed. The EU lists minimum sources for a diligent search in the Annex to the Orphan Works Directive. Advertising requirements (in the national press or equivalent) are provided in Japan and India.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) The United States had proposed a &amp;ldquo;limited liability&amp;rdquo; approach, under which the use of orphan works is possible after a reasonable search. In the case of an infringement claim orphan users are liable only for a reasonable compensation. Denmark uses an Extended Collective Licensing system, which involves collective negotiation with users (normally for multiple licensing) valid also for non-represented authors. In turn, the EU leaves Member States free to choose their regulatory approach (for example, France has chosen a central licensing system in its forthcoming legislation). All the other countries reviewed implement the central licensing system, with a central public authority granting copyright licences on orphan works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(4) Prices are set by central authorities in the countries that have a central licensing system, and by collecting societies in Denmark. Interestingly, national central authorities have claimed that although no official negotiation process is provided by law, the price of licences is set on a case by case basis, after considering the individual circumstances of the applicant. Set prices can be challenged mostly in an ordinary court of law in the examined countries, or alternatively before the licensing authority with a quasi-judicial procedure (e.g. Canada). Infringement claims are handled by ordinary courts in all countries (including the US) or by licensing authorities with quasi-judicial procedures (in Hungary). In Denmark, both prices and infringement claims are under the jurisdiction of a special tribunal (the Copyright Licensing Tribunal). The above rules on price, infringement, and legal remedies do not derive from EU law, which leaves these matters to Member States.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(5) In Canada, Japan, India, Denmark and France an upfront payment is normally required byte applicant in exchange for using orphan works. In Canada, payment is upfront in approximately two-thirds of cases, whilst it is contingent on the rightholder reappearing in the remaining third. See De Beer and Bouchard (2010). In Hungary the amount is identified but may not be deposited (for non-profit licensees). It will be paid directly to the rightholder, in the event that he or she reappears. In the US, no payment is made until a court decision is issued, following an infringement claim.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Particular roles are envisaged for collecting societies in Denmark, in which they handle the whole system, Hungary, where collecting societies retain unclaimed revenues after five years from expiry of licence, and Canada, where collecting societies are consulted during tariff setting, and hold collected fees (to be used as they see fit).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(6) In the US, in Hungary, and France a voluntary public online register for suspected orphan works is established. The EU is establishing a register at the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM). In Japan, some institutions have their own register of orphan works. No register is envisaged in India, Canada or Denmark (prior to the Orphan Works Directive). However details of all licences granted are available on-line in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;II. Rights Clearance Simulation&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Rights Clearance Exercise&amp;rdquo; reported in Study II is a combination of various methods. In a first step a simulation approach is employed to collect a unique dataset on actual or potential licence fees for orphan works. Representatives of rights clearance authorities from countries covered in the comparative legal review (Canada, Denmark, France, Hungary, India, Japan, supplemented by some US data) were asked to provide a licence fee for each of six scenarios that are likely to occur in reality (from creating a small online resource to mass digitisation projects).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The identification of the various scenarios was the outcome of a rigorous methodological procedure. The six identified scenarios were:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Historical geographic maps for a video game for mobile phones (up to 50 maps&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;A vintage postcard collection for web publication and eventual sale of prints (up to50 cards)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;National folk tune recordings for multimedia/teaching (DVD) (up to 50)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Re-issuing a 1960/70s TV series as part of a digital on-demand service (one series)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mass digitisation of photographs (archives) by a public non-profit institution, with possible sale of prints (above 100,000 items)&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mass digitisation of books by a private for-profit institution, with possible sale of books (above 100,000 items)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Two rates for each scenario were sought, for commercial and non-commercial use. In a second step the dataset is subjected to various analytical techniques, including a regression approach and a comparison of collective licensing systems against others through the computation of effect sizes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Findings Study II:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(1) There does not appear to be a standard price for licensing orphan works. In fact tariffs vary widely. For example, to clear 50 items from a folk tune archive for commercial use will cost the equivalent of &amp;pound;188 per year in Canada, and (under reasonable assumptions) &amp;pound;9,312 per year in France. In fact, the only consistent finding appears to be that in almost all cases commercial licence fees tend to exceed non-commercial ones.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(2) Licences were not available for all scenarios. Re-issuing orphaned broadcasts seems particularly problematic, with no licence offered in any of the countries investigated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(3) There is no systematic recognition of what may constitute an appropriate duration for licences. Licences were very variable from country to country, ranging from a monthly to a five-year licence, without the provision of a permanent licence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(4) We find high tariffs that discourage mass digitisation projects. Per item fees initially appearing very low and thus sustainable turn out to render mass-digitisation unviable for public and non-profit institutions when scaled up under reasonable assumptions. Mass digitisation projects involving 100,000 items may incur annual licensing fees exceeding &amp;pound;1 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(5) The average level of fees imposed on a potential user of an orphan work is similar in collective and individual licensing regimes. This is an interesting finding because it mitigates arguments that one of the regimes will lead to higher fees. The operating costs involved in running an orphan works scheme appear therefore an important factor when choosing between individual and collective approaches.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(6) A limited liability system seems to have advantages for archives and other non-profit institutions exposed to orphan works, enabling those organisations to share their stock of orphaned artefacts with the public. In contrast, the up-front rights clearing seems to provide more appropriate incentives for commercial uses of orphaned artefacts, guaranteeing that a reappearing rightholder will be compensated for the exploitation of any work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Together, the findings from both studies indicate the need for a more structured and consistent approach in governing orphan works that is reflected in the pricing and duration of licences, and in the costs of running any licensing system.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8378</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-06T16:05:09Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-create</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Torremans, Paul L.C.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Intellectual Property Puts Article 6(1) Brussels I Regulation to the Test</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-09-10</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8378</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.8378</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;The contrast between national intellectual property rights, which are still granted on the basis of the territoriality principle, and which, as a consequence, logically produce on the one hand parallel rights in several countries and on the other hand the international exploitation of such rights, results in a scenario where similar violations, mostly performed by defendants with a mutual relationship between them, give rise to claims based on similar national provisions on intellectual property. Article 2 of Brussels I Regulation allows for the separate prosecution of every defendant in the country where he or she resides. Although Article 5(3) provides for an alternative solution, the standard scenario involves a multitude of claims submitted country by country, apparently as a logical consequence of the territoriality principle.[1]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Intellectual Property has been the object of considerable harmonization over the years, on the basis of both international treaties and European Union law. Without going too much into details, it is obvious that the combination of territorial (national) intellectual property rights and their exploitation beyond national boundaries raises questions related with the possible application of Article 6(1) of the Brussels I Regulation. A&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;forum connexitatis&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;offers in fact the possibility to pursue the infringement of what, from a commercial point of view, is often considered as a single right, rather than a bundle of parallel national intellectual property rights. Thus, the patent infringement performed in a uniform manner, for example by the commercialization of a copy of the patented product by related defendants, is pursued as an single case before a single court. Article 6(1) offers therefore an interesting opportunity in a number of intellectual property cases. However, Article 6(1) is principally targeted at defendants residing in different Member States acting with a common agenda,[2]&amp;nbsp;and this is in contrast with the most common scenario of intellectual property rights infringement, which involves both parallel rights and defendants that act (individually) in a parallel fashion, whether or not they act within a group of companies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hopes that the recent reform of the Brussels I Regulation would bring clarification on this point, since the existing jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice was not generally supported by intellectual property doctrine and practitioners, have unfortunately not been fulfilled. Except for the fact that the concerned defendant is now expressly defined, nothing changes in the existing text of the Article 6(1) which now becomes Article 8(1).[3]&amp;nbsp;Legal practice must therefore continue to work with the following text of the new Article 8 (the new fragment is within parenthesis):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;[A person domiciled in a Member State] may also be sued:&lt;br /&gt; 1. where he is one of a number of defendants, in the courts for the place where any one of them is domiciled, provided the claims are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings;&lt;br /&gt; 2.[...]&amp;lsquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Debating the causes of this&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;status quo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is not very useful for the legal practice. Whether it is an absence of consensus on a modified text or a confirmation of the Court&amp;rsquo;s interpretation of Article 6(1) is of limited interest. Legal practice must in fact continue working with the existing jurisprudence of the Court.[4]&amp;nbsp;This contribution attempts therefore to clarify the Court&amp;rsquo;s current position.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[1]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; See J.J.

Writing about visual work without reproducing that work is an impoverished exercise, for both writer and reader. But, reproducing visual material can trigger concerns on the part of the conscientious author or &amp;ndash; more often &amp;ndash; demands on the part of the publisher about the need to secure copyright permission. In this respect, comics scholarship is no different from any other field of visual or cultural studies. Clearing rights for publication can be frustrating and time-consuming, and academic publishers often manage the business of copyright clearance by making their authors responsible for securing permissions. European Comic Art provides a good example. When an article is accepted for publication, authors are &amp;lsquo;required to submit copyright agreements and all necessary permission letters for reprinting or modifying copyrighted materials, both textual and graphic&amp;rsquo;, and are &amp;lsquo;responsible for obtaining all permissions and clearing any associated fees.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not all publishers, however, adhere to such a black and white position. The Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics is published by Taylor &amp;amp; Francis. In the &amp;lsquo;Authors Services&amp;rsquo; section of their website, the publisher acknowledges that reproducing short extracts of text and other types of material &amp;lsquo;for the purposes of criticism may be possible without formal permission&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To better understand when permission is needed, the publisher directs its authors to the Publishers Association&amp;rsquo;s Permissions Guidelines. To better understand what rights need to be cleared, authors are directed to the publisher&amp;rsquo;s own FAQs about using third-party material in an academic article. Thirteen of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s FAQs expressly relate to the reproduction of visual material, and of those only two concede the possibility of reproducing work without permission (they relate to, respectively, the use of &amp;lsquo;screenshots or grabs of film or video&amp;rsquo; and the use of &amp;lsquo;very old paintings&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What is not clear from the FAQs document is whether the publisher is purporting to accurately represent the law in this area. If so &amp;ndash; as we shall see &amp;ndash; the FAQs document is clearly deficient. If, however, Taylor &amp;amp; Francis is simply using the FAQs document to set out the parameters of its own editorial policy on the reproduction of copyright-protected third-party material, then so be it: the publisher is perfectly entitled to adopt such editorial guidelines as it sees fit. I would suggest, though, that in cleaving to an editorial policy that fails to take full advantage of the scope which the copyright regime allows for the lawful reproduction of copyright-protected material without need for permission, the publisher is missing an opportunity to enable and encourage its contributors to augment and enrich comics scholarship as a discipline.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is in this respect that The Comics Grid is more ambitious and forward-thinking: it actively promotes the lawful use of copyright-protected content for the purposes of academic scholarship. The journal&amp;rsquo;s copyright policy sets out that third-party images are reproduced on the basis of &amp;lsquo;educational fair use&amp;rsquo;, with readers and contributors directed to Columbia University Libraries&amp;rsquo; Fair Use Checklist for further information. This is a checklist that has been developed to help academics and other scholars make a reasonable and balanced determination about whether their use of copyright-protected work is permissible under s.107 of the US Copyright Act 1976: the fair use provision.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Obviously, The Comics Grid locates its copyright advice within the context of US copyright law. But, as a Glasgow-based academic, with an interest in both the history and the current state of the UK copyright regime, my particular focus within this comic concerns the extent to which academics &amp;ndash; or indeed anyone interested in writing about comics &amp;ndash; can rely upon UK copyright law to reproduce extracts and excerpts from published comics and graphic novels without having to ask the copyright owner for permission. To address that issue we must consider three key questions. What constitutes &amp;lsquo;a work&amp;rsquo; protected by copyright within the context of comics publishing? What does it mean to speak of &amp;lsquo;insubstantial copying&amp;rsquo; from a copyright-protected comic? And what can be copied lawfully from a comic for the purpose of criticism and review?&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8380</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-06T16:04:59Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-create</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Stobo, Victoria</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Deazley, Ronan</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Anderson, Ian G.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Copyright &amp; Risk: Scoping the Wellcome Digital Library Project</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-12-13</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8380</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.8380</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;amp; Risk: Scoping the Wellcome Digital Library is a comprehensive case study which aims to assess the merits of the risk-managed approach to copyright clearance adopted by the Wellcome Library (WL) in the course of their pilot digitisation project Codebreakers: Makers of Modern Genetics.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whilst the WL clearly identifies as a library, as a collecting institution it extends from books and periodicals to include archives and manuscripts, art, the moving image and sound associated with the biomedical sciences and the medical humanities.[1] In this case study we consider the digitisation of both library (books) and archive material as part of the Codebreakers project, although our principal interest lies with the archive digitisation strand.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This report assesses the merits of the WL&amp;rsquo;s approach to copyright compliance by:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Introducing the WL and the Codebreakers mass digitisation project&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Outlining the copyright challenges presented by the mass-digitisation effort&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Discussing the risk management methods used by the WL in determining which rights should be cleared&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Examining the results of the risk-managed copyright clearance process&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As a result of this analysis, the research aims to:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Compare the Wellcome experience on Codebreakers to rights clearance exercises attempted by other cultural heritage institutions&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Provide policy makers with useful data and insights to inform the debate on copyright exceptions for cultural heritage institutions&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Discuss the relevance of this approach for other UK archive institutions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Prior to the preparation of this case study, CREATe published a working paper in March 2013[2], reviewing current and proposed changes to UK copyright law, and specifically exceptions provided for libraries and archives. This was further extended by a review of available literature on the digitisation of archival and library collections for publication online, contextualized with specific examples.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Existing literature reveals that rights clearance procedures impose prohibitive burdens on cultural institutions, through the cost of staff time and training in both diligent search and the process of contacting rightsholders.[3] It also indicates that in most cases, the results of rights clearance processes are unsatisfactory: either copyright holders cannot be identified and traced; or those who are contacted, do not respond to permission requests. Archives, in contrast to libraries, have the added complication of dealing with larger and more varied collections of material, the majority of which has been created for non-commercial purposes; this material is often unpublished at the point of deposit with the archive, and typically includes higher proportions of orphan works (when compared with traditional library collections).[4]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Documented examples of archival rights clearance projects are scarce, and where studies do exist, they have generally been conducted at a large-scale level, and do not contain sufficient detail to enable in-depth analysis of the rights clearance process.[5] Anna Vuopala&amp;rsquo;s excellent Orphan Works study[6] includes examples of rights clearance projects at 19 institutions, and focuses almost exclusively on the time and cost required to clear rights, which is extremely useful, but leaves out other valuable details about the right clearance process: for example, the number of rightsholders&amp;rsquo; contact details found; the refusal rates and reasons given for refusal at each institution; and the number of rightsholders who do not respond to permission requests.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In general, there is a lack of detailed evidence concerning rights clearance in archival digitisation, and especially in relation to projects that employ risk-management strategies in a sector which is known to be highly risk averse. The WL was chosen as an appropriate subject for this case study given the scale of their digitisation aims, and their use of a risk managed approach to copyright compliance.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Codebreakers, as a digitisation project, was never designed to facilitate a study of the process of rights clearance &amp;ndash; by the time data collection for the Copyright and Risk Project began, Codebreakers was entering its final stages, with the official launch of the project website taking place in February 2013. As a result, semi-structured interviews were chosen as the most effective method of obtaining data about the project. Interviews were conducted with key project staff at the WL as well as with staff from five partner archives involved in delivering the Codebreakers project.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The semi-structured format of the interviews was chosen for its flexibility; a list of questions was chosen, but given the length of the interviews, it was possible to divert from these questions and follow up on unexpected lines of enquiry raised by the interview subjects. Also, by working from a set list of questions, it was still possible to collate the answers to specific questions, thereby producing some quantifiable data. The questions were generated through a discussion of the aims of the project, and through consultation of other similar projects: specifically Jean Dryden&amp;rsquo;s doctoral research on the practices of Canadian repositories when making their archival material available online.[7]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The interviews covered five specific areas: the respondents&amp;rsquo; role within their place of work; their role working on the Codebreakers project; the rights clearance challenges posed by the project; the development of policies and practices over the timeframe of the project; and finally, the respondents&amp;rsquo; own views and experience of copyright, divorced from an institutional perspective.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Using this method of enquiry, respondents were asked about policies and practices mandated by the institutions they work for, but also for their own opinions as professionals, built up though work experience, education and training. By encouraging the respondents to reflect on their own experience, it was also possible to use the &amp;lsquo;snowball&amp;rsquo; technique to tease out pointers to documentation and other resources used by the respondents, not only in relation to this project, but to their experience working on others as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once completed, the interviews were transcribed to provide usable data. The transcriptions were used for a variety of purposes. Responses to specific questions were logged to give quantifiable results. Where respondents gave specific examples of practices, or policy changes, these are used as evidence in the text of this report. As a result of interviewing respondents at the Wellcome, project documentation was also made available for inclusion in this case study. This material takes two forms: policy documents which were circulated and updated as the project took place; and an internal report produced towards the end of the project, which includes a variety of statistics and more general lessons learned. The documentation has been discussed in the text of the report and examples of specific documents are available in the Appendix.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This combination of anecdotal evidence, combined with results and project documentation, has allowed us to trace the processes by which the WL has used risk management to achieve their digitisation objectives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[1] The Wellcome Library Collection Development Policy is available athttp://wellcomelibrary.org/content/documents/policy-documents/collection-development-policy.pdf&amp;nbsp;[Accessed: 5 Dec 2013]&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[2] Deazley, R., and Stobo, V.
