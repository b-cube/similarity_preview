It is based on data from computerised police incident logs and self-completed surveys of officers. Findings indicate that the application of resources to the investigation of solvable incidents helps explains detection levels. Solvability characteristics determine whether burglaries may be solved, but successful detection is contingent on resource inputs, which enable detection potential due to solvability to be realised. Resources appear to be more cost-effectively used in earlier investigative stages than in detectives\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd further investigations. Better solvability predictors of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdintermediate outputs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and of the promising cases for further investigation by detectives, would enable resources to be more cost-effectively allocated. Findings differ from those of earlier studies in so far as large resource inputs raise detection rates for high solvability cases while some low solvability offences are solved, indicating that not all low solvability cases should be screened out by triage.

Whether justified or unnecessary/excessive, the exercise of power by the police can potentially tarnish their relationship with the community. Police misconduct can translate into complaints against the police, which carry large economic and social costs. The question we try to answer is: do body-worn-cameras reduce the prevalence of use-of-force and/or citizens\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd complaints against the police?&#13; Methods: We empirically tested the use of body-worn-cameras by measuring the effect of videotaping police-public encounters on incidents of police use-of-force and complaints, in randomized-controlled settings. Over 12 months, we randomly-assigned officers to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdexperimental-shifts\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd during which they were equipped with body-worn HD cameras that recorded all contacts with the public and to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcontrol-shifts\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd without the cameras (n=988). We nominally defined use-of-force, both unnecessary/excessive and reasonable, as a non-desirable response in police-public encounters. We estimate the causal effect of the use of body-worn-videos on the two outcome variables using both between-group differences using a Poisson regression model as well as before-after estimates using interrupted time-series analyses.&#13; Results: We found that the likelihood of force being used in control conditions were roughly twice those in experimental conditions. Similarly, a pre/post analysis of use-of-force and complaints data also support this result: the number of complaints filed against officers dropped from 0.7 complaints per 1,000 contacts to 0.07 per 1,000 contacts. We discuss the findings in terms of theory, research methods, policy and future avenues of research on body-worn-videos. This is the accepted manuscript.

However, relatively little is known about the specific impact of this model of punishment provision on the daily life of prisoners, including those areas that are particularly salient not just to debates about neo-liberal penality, but the wider reconfiguration of public service provision and frontline work. Drawing on a study of values, practices and quality of life in five private sector and two public sector prisons in England and Wales, this article seeks to compare and explain three key domains of prison culture and quality: first, the quality of relationships between frontline staff and prisoners; second, levels of staff \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdprofessionalism\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdjailcraft\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd); and third, the manner in which prisoners experienced the deployment of state authority. The study identifies some of the characteristic strengths and weaknesses of the public and private prison sectors respectively, particularly in relation to staff professionalism and its impact on the prisoner experience. These findings have relevance beyond the sphere of prisons and punishment. This is the author's accepted manuscript and will be under embargo until the 13th of August 2016.

The PhD asks how broad theories of penal transformation have impacted on probation practice and practice ideals by looking at what probation workers say they are trying to achieve in their work, and how they go about this. I ask what, if any, resistance exists amongst workers to policies that appear to be in tension with the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdadvise, assist and befriend\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ethos of the Probation Service and examine the impact of managerialism on practice. The dissertation emanates from a disjunction between Garland\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (2001a) thesis of a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdculture of control\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and traditional notions of probation culture, and investigates this with reference to four key themes: rehabilitation, punishment, risk management, and managerialism.&#13; &#13; The opening two chapters explore the concept of late-modernity and discuss other research on probation's values and practice ideals. I describe and critique Garland\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds thesis, suggesting that probation practice is the product of new policies and politics interacting with \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtraditional\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd methods of practice. I discuss probation workers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd values to explore, on a theoretical level, how they have changed during recent years.&#13; &#13; The empirical chapters use data collected through a combination of observations and interviews in two probation teams in England. These chapters contrast pervasive managerialism with probation workers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd preferred ways of measuring \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuccess\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, arguing that there is a need to incorporate the offender into the system. I examine the preparation of pre-sentence reports and the supervision process to explore probation workers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd attitudes to punishment and rehabilitation, respectively. Accountability has shifted considerably in recent years and the impact of managerialism raises several issues in regard to the way in which probation workers are held to account. Finally, I explore the impact of managerialism by looking at the exercise of discretion and the recent shift towards compliance, away from enforcement.&#13; &#13; In the concluding chapter I present the main findings of this research on probation practice. Following an overview of the main findings, this chapter describes the changes that have taken place since the fieldwork, and shows how the research presents a picture of how probation culture has, and has not, changed in the context of Garland\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds culture of control. Ultimately, this research is invaluable for Probation Trusts and academics in terms of thinking about how practitioners might react to yet more change and I outline the implications of the research findings for the Government\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds current proposals to reform community sentences and probation. </description> <dc:date>2013-10-08T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
