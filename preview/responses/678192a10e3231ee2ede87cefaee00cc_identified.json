Respondents were asked about drug abuse in their communities and at work, and whether or not they themselves have had a drug problem. They were also asked their opinions on using the military to stop drug importation, mandatory drug testing, and how serious the drug problem is. Respondents' specific experiences with many different drugs were recorded. Demographic characteristics were also included.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1986-08\" cycle=\"P1\">1986-08</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1986-08\" cycle=\"P1\">1986-08</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>The population of the United States aged 18 and over.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Households were selected by random digit dialing.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          telephone interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 Included in the data is a weight variable which must be used in all analysis.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR08636.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
