Prevailing wisdom on \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpay what you want\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (PWYW) pricing focuses on the influence of altruism or fairness on consumers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd payments. In this paper, we offer a different perspective by demonstrating that, if the seller and consumers interact repeatedly, and future provision of PWYW depends on whether current revenue under PWYW is sufficient for the seller to achieve financial goals, then paying under PWYW can be likened to paying for a threshold public good. Our model implies that continuous provision of PWYW can be profitable even when all consumers are self-interested. We find in two experiments that if there is pre-payment online chat-room-style communication among consumers, then efficient tacit coordination at the payment stage can be accomplished to achieve continuous PWYW provision. We also show experimentally that pre-payment communication can sustain PWYW provision even when consumers have limited feedback about each other\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds payments, or limited information about the market.

Meeks, G.; Meeks, J. G. This paper explores the dramatic fall in receipts of UK corporation tax&#13; (UKCT) from banks, and the widening gap between the global corporation&#13; tax recorded as payable in banks\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd financial statements and the UKCT&#13; receipts recorded by the tax authorities. It reviews possible explanations,&#13; including changes in tax rates, in operating profits, in deductions which&#13; reduce taxable profits, and in the share of profit originating in, or recorded&#13; in, overseas jurisdictions. It assigns significant roles to tax-deductible asset&#13; impairments and to the allocation of profits among different jurisdictions. It&#13; suggests reasons why the recovery in banks\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd global operating profits may not&#13; be accompanied by an early sharp recovery in UKCT receipts.

While basic research remains vital, the growing cancer epidemic in countries of low and middle income warrants urgent action \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd focusing on both research and service delivery innovation. Mobile technology can reduce costs, improve access to health services, and strengthen health systems to meet the interrelated challenges of cancer and other noncommunicable diseases. Experience has shown that even very poor and remote communities that only have basic primary health care can benefit from mobile health (or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmHealth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) interventions. We argue that cancer researchers and practitioners have an opportunity to leverage mHealth technologies that have successfully targeted other health conditions, rather than reinventing these tools. We call for particular attention to human centred design approaches for adapting existing technologies to suit distinctive aspects of cancer care and to align delivery with local context \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and we make a number of recommendations for integrating mHealth delivery research with the work of designers, engineers and implementers in large-scale delivery programmes.

In the wake of the dramatic growth in shale gas production in the United States, interest in shale gas exploration in Europe has been driven primarily by concerns over industrial competitiveness and energy security. A number of studies have been carried out to understand the success factors underpinning the US shale gas revolution and how this success could be replicated in Europe. Most of these studies focus on the macroeconomic and energy market impact of a possible shale gas production in Europe. These studies are in general sceptical about the prospects of shale gas development relative to other gas supply options to Europe. By considering the other options available in greater detail and exploring the stochastic nature of shale gas exploration and production as they apply to production economics, we conclude that this scepticism may be overstated. Apart from political opposition that has shut down shale gas exploration in a number of European member states because of concerns over environmental risks, in some countries notably the UK, the combination of political support and a large, liberalised gas market may offer at least a plausible case for shale gas production. To properly assess the potential for shale gas though, a more rigorous, probabilistic analysis of the associated production economics will need to be carried out. This is the accepted manuscript.
