Lidar data will serve multiple purposes, but have primarily been collected to (1) evaluate active faulting, slope instability, thaw settlement, erosion, and other engineering constraints along proposed pipeline routes, and (2) provide a base layer for the state-federal GIS database that will be used to evaluate permit applications and construction plans.  Lake polygons represent areas of water bodies (excluding streams and rivers) &gt; 150 square meteres, present at the time of lidar data collection.</abstract> <purpose>Provide vector data depicting water bodies greater than 150 square meters.</purpose> <supplinf> This metadata file was written to document and describe, as a whole, all the lake polygon files generated for this project. The original metadata files provided by Watershed Sciences, Inc. are also included in the download package and may provide additional useful information that is specific to each file. The metadata files provided by Watershed Sciences, Inc. have not been reviewed for accuracy or compliance with FGDC standards. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include several elements that are required to facilitate internal data management. For each data delivery area, reports documenting data collection methodology, accuracy, and quality control were provided by Watershed Sciences and the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI). These reports have been combined into single comprehensive reports organized by delivery region. The lidar QC report (the comprehensive report from DOGAMI) and the lidar delivery report (the comprehensive report from Watershed Sciences) can be found at http://www.dggs.alaska.gov/pubs/id/22722. Information about the quadrangles included in individual delivery regions can be found in the lidar delivery index report included with the data download. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include several elements that are required to facilitate internal data management.

The survey used the Leica  ALS 60 system. Near-nadir scan angles were used to increase penetration of vegetation to ground surfaces.   Ground-level GPS and aircraft IMU were collected during the flight.</procdesc> <procdate>2010 and 2011</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Processing lidar data: (1) Flight lines and data were reviewed to ensure complete coverage of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. (2) Laser point-return coordinates were computed using ALS Post Processor software, IPAS Pro GPS/INS software, and Waypoint GPS, based on independent data from the lidar system, IMU, and aircraft. (3) The raw lidar file was assembled into flight lines per return with each point having an associated x, y, and z coordinate. (4) Visual inspection of swath-to-swath laser point consistencies in the study area were used to perform manual refinements of system alignment. (5) Custom algorithms were designed to evaluate points between adjacent flight lines.  Automated system alignment was computed based on randomly selected swath-to-swath accuracy measurements that consider elevation, slope, and intensities.  Specifically, refinement in the combination of system pitch, roll, and yaw-offset parameters optimize internal consistency. (6) Noise (e.g., pits and birds) was filtered using ALS postprocessing software, based on known elevation ranges, and included the removal of any cycle slips.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011, 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Hydro-flattening:  A combination of automated and manual detection and adjustment techniques  was used to identify lake boundaries and water levels for closed water bodies with a surface area &gt; 150 square meters.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011, 2012</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <gridsys> <gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>5</utmzone> <transmer> <sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer> <longcm>-153</longcm> <latprjo>0.000000</latprjo> <feast>500000.000000</feast> <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth> </transmer> </utm> </gridsys> <planci> <plance>row and column</plance> <coordrep> <absres>1.000000</absres> <ordres>1.000000</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>meters</plandu> <pclname>lakes</pclname> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn> <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257222</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>lakes.shp</enttypl> <enttypd>Polygons showing lakes greater than 150 square meters</enttypd> <enttypds>Watershed Sciences</enttypds> <ealname>lakes</ealname> </enttyp> </detailed> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>3354 College Road</address> <city>Fairbanks</city> <state>AK</state> <postal>99709-3707</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>907-451-5020</cntvoice> <cntfax>907-451-5050</cntfax> <cntemail>dggspubs@alaska.gov</cntemail> <hours>8 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, except State holidays</hours> <cntinst>Please view our website (http://www.dggs.alaska.gov) for the latest information on available data.
