Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.  In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.  In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. </abstract> <purpose>This shapefile contains approximately 37 kilometers of seismic trackline data collected with an Edgetech SB-424 chirp subbottom profiler by the U.S. Geological Survey during USGS survey 2005-04-FA. These data were collected in Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire as part of a collaborative USGS and New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services research program to assess the distribution of variable leaf water-milfoil.  The seismic trackline data are used in conjunction with the unique shot point navigation to aid interpretation and correlate features visible within the seismic record with features within the sidescan-sonar and bathymetric data (i.e. surficial sediment distribution and topography).</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20050726</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-71.390529</westbc> <eastbc>-71.361101</eastbc> <northbc>43.728549</northbc> <southbc>43.710921</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>General</themekt> <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey> <themekey>USGS</themekey> <themekey>Coastal and Marine Geology Program</themekey> <themekey>CMGP</themekey> <themekey>Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center</themekey> <themekey>WHCMSC</themekey> <themekey>Marine Geology</themekey> <themekey>field activity number 2005-004-FA</themekey> <themekey>USGS CMGP InfoBank ID R-1-05-NH</themekey> <themekey>field activity number 05004</themekey> <themekey>subbottom profiler</themekey> <themekey>seismic</themekey> <themekey>chirp</themekey> <themekey>Edgetech SB-424 subbottom profiler</themekey> <themekey>polyline shapefile</themekey> <themekey>tracklines</themekey> <themekey>survey line</themekey> <themekey>R/V Rafael</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey> <themekey>location</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>General</placekt> <placekey>North America</placekey> <placekey>United States</placekey> <placekey>New Hampshire</placekey> <placekey>Lake Winnipesaukee</placekey> <placekey>Moultonborough Bay</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None.</accconst> <useconst>Public domain data from the U.S. Government are freely redistributable with proper metadata and source attribution.

Navigation data were acquired with a LGBX Pro receiver and sent to Triton-Elics Delph seismic acquisition software, where Chirp sub-bottom data were recorded in Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y (SEG-Y) format (Barry and others, 1975) with DGPS logged to the SEG-Y trace headers.  The Edgetech SB-424 chirp subbottom profiler was towed near the surface, close to the R/V Rafael. The instrument was secured in this position throughout the survey. Due to this tow configuration, any layback was minimal. The overall horizontal accuracy, given even a small (~ 1 meter) offset between the WAAS antenna and the tow-body, is + or - 5 meters. </horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin> <pubdate>Unpublished Material</pubdate> <title>Raw Chirp Subbottom Data</title> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>online</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20050726</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>none</srccitea> <srccontr> Chirp subbottom data were acquired with an Edgetech SB-424 chirp subbottom profiler.  The SB-424 was deployed off the port side of the USGS R/V Rafael and towed close to the lake surface.  Approximately 37 km of chirp subbottom data were collected.  Data were recorded at a 75-millisecond (ms) record length (1875 samples, 40 microsecond sample interval) and a 4-24 kHz sweep and were logged using Triton-Elics Delph seismic acquisition software (version 2005) in Society of Exploration Geophysicists Y (SEG-Y) format (Barry and others, 1975) with WAAS navigation logged to the SEG-Y file trace headers. Navigation in the SEG-Y header was stored as seconds of arc. The raw chirp SEG-Y contained 3 channels: raw, match-filtered, and envelope detected.  The envelope detected channel was used for data processing. </srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> A C-shell script was executed using Sioseis (v. 2011.2.7) to read the raw  SEG-Y file and write out a new SEG-Y file with the shots renumbered starting at 1.  A second  C-shell script was executed using Seismic Unix (version 4.1) to read the renumbered SEG-Y files, write a Seismic Unix format file (*.su), and extract SEG-Y trace header information, which included shot number, source x (arc seconds), source y  (arc seconds), year,  Julian Day,  hour, minute, second (UTC). Geographic coordinates (stored in arc seconds WGS 84) were converted to eastings and northings,  UTM, Zone 19N, meters using proj (v. 4.7.1). Before saving the header information to a text file, the data were filtered using AWK (no version) to save only unique shot point locations. The unique shot navigation for each seismic line were then concatenated into a comma delimited (.csv) text file. The header records for the first several shots contained no navigation information, therefore the &apos;first&apos; shot of the line is considered the first shot with usable data stored in the header.  This was generally within the first 10 shots for the majority of lines. (Stockwell, 2005)  Jane F. Denny performed this and all subsequent process steps. </procdesc> <procdate>2013</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Jane F.
