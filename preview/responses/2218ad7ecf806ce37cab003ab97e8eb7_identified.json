Respondents were asked whether they approved of the performances of President Obama and Congress on a range of topics including: the economy, the budget deficit, economic recovery, intervention in the Middle East and North Africa (specifically Libya), Social Security, and workers' rights. Queries also investigated respondents' opinions of the Tea Party movement, the war in Afghanistan, Republican leaders, partisan cooperation, and the quality of leadership provided by the political parties. Additional subjects included: how to resolve state budget deficits, social security, government shutdown, unions, the price of gasoline, equal marriage rights, and women in the military. Political partisanship and left-right political self-placement were also solicited. Demographic and other background information includes age, gender, race, religious affiliation, education, and locality of residence.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"2011-03\" cycle=\"P1\">2011-03</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2011-03-10\" cycle=\"P1\">2011-03-10</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2011-03-13\" cycle=\"P1\">2011-03-13</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                   <geogUnit>Census tract</geogUnit>                   <anlyUnit>Individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Persons aged 18 years and over living in households with telephones in the contiguous 48 United States.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Random digit dialing          </sampProc>                                         <collMode>computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)</collMode>                            <weight>               <p> The data are not weighted.
