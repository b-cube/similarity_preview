The fish \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd mostly a type of chichlid called tilapia - are very quickly sold and filleted, often by children, with the guts eagerly snapped up by the huge marabou storks that casually wander among the boats.</p> <p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QkKV4kESBF0?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></iframe></p> <div class=\"smallquote\">Sustainability is a huge issue, with nothing coping with the 2.5% annual population increase. However, unlike most other places in the world with population problems, neither water nor energy should be a major limiting resource in Ethiopia. The fishing operation on Lake Hawassa was obviously providing a substantial amount of food protein to the whole area, as well as high employment \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd whether it is sustainable is debated, but the net size restriction, vegetarian nature of the fish (hence putting them low in the food chain), and the limited landing area probably mean that overexploitation is not as major a&nbsp;problem as some others that we saw (cutting wood for fuel, seen being incredibly wastefully used in the cooking at the end of the video), or overgrazing.</div> <div class=\"smallquotereference\">Professor Pat Heslop-Harrison</div> <p>A lot of Pat\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research involves bananas so, while in the Rift Valley, he also spent a lot of time looking at ensete, a closely related crop which is eaten by 10 million people in Southern Ethiopia.

We look at repetitive DNA and its evolution, with a particular focus on tandemly repeated satellite sequences and retrotransposons. Key methods include molecular cytogenetics, DNA sequence analysis and systems biology approaches. Taking a comparative genomics approach, we have interlinked projects with a range of different species: a particular focus is on plant crop species (banana, cereals including wheat, rye and barley, brassicas, and cowpea), while important projects include work with Dictyostelium, Drosophila, Scallops (Pecten), and bovids.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The main page is accessed from <a href=\"http://www.molcyt.com\">www.molcyt.com</a></p> <p></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>phh4</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biological Sciences</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2008-08-29T11:30:16Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/estates/environment/news/2013-news/hog-watchers-wanted\">     <title>Hog Watchers Wanted</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/estates/environment/news/2013-news/hog-watchers-wanted</link>     <description>Your help is required to locate Leicester's dwindling hedgehog population.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h4 class=\" \"><span>Hedgehogs have been in decline in recent years with no real estimate of their populations.

It found that each bumblebee worker inherits two copies of every gene, one from the mother and one from the father, but only one is used. This is known as genomic imprinting and occurs through a process called methylation which has been found to be important in whether or not a worker bumblebee reproduces.</p> <p><b>Listen to a podcast

A chance for some of our best postgrads to present posters of their work. In the run-up to the Festival, we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre summarising the presentations on Newsblog, grouped into slightly arbitrary bundles.Today we\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre taking a look at research in the Departments of <a title=\"Cell Physiology and Pharmacology\" class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/cpp\">Cell Physiology and Pharmacology</a>, <a title=\"Infection, Immunity and Inflammation\" class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/iii\">Infection Immunity and Inflammation</a>, <a title=\"Biology\" class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\">Biology</a> and <a title=\"Biochemistry\" class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biochemistry\">Biochemistry</a>.</p> <h2>Uncovering the Molecular Pieces in an Ancient Plant Sex Mystery</h2> <h3>Michael Borg (Department of Biology)</h3> <p>Humanity is dependent on flowering plants for food, yet there is a fundamental aspect of flowering plant reproduction which remains a mystery, Each pollen grain contains not one but two fertile sperm cells, required for a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddouble fertilisation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of female sex cells within a flower, leading to grains, fruit and seeds. Michael\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research into the molecular pathways which govern precisely how these twin sperm cells are created has tremendous potential for improving food production. He co-authored a paper in <em>The Plant Cell</em> earlier this year on the importance of the DUO1 gene.</p> <h2>The role of p53-dependent microRNAs in cancer prevention</h2> <h3>Nadia Sheree Purmessur (Department of Biochemistry)</h3> <p>Short lengths of ribonucleic acid called microRNAs can \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdswitch off\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd genes and have tremendous potential in the treatment of cancer. Protein p53 is a tumour suppressor which regulates microRNAs, enabling the protein to indirectly control the expression of target genes. Nadia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research examines the relationship between microRNAs and p53 and how this might be used to further our understanding of cancer.</p> <h2>Slime Cities</h2> <dl style=\"width:250px;\" class=\"image-right captioned\"> <dt><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/old-images/fpgr/staph.jpg/image\" alt=\"staph.jpg\" title=\"staph.jpg\" height=\"168\" width=\"250\" /></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:250px;\">Micrograph of a Staphylococcus biofilm (image: Wikipedia)</dd> </dl> <h3>Fathima Farveen Sharaff (Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation)</h3> <p>Microbial biofilms, sometimes called slime cities, are microscopic communities of bacteria encased and defended by a protective coating of slime. They can cause problems in many situations where they occur, most especially in intravenous (IV) tubes where they can becaused by bacteria reacting with the very drug being administered. Fathima\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research into biofilms will provide a greater understanding of what causes them and how they can be prevented.</p> <h2>A fluid you can breathe?</h2> <h3>Nawal Helmi (Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation)</h3> <p>Nawal is researching the use of perfluorocarbons in the treatment of Sickle Cell Anaemia (SCA). Perfluocarbons are derived from organic chemicals such as methane and propane but with fluorine atoms instead of hydrogen atoms. Because of fluorine\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds massive reactivity, these chemicals can dissolve enormous amounts of oxygen, to the extent that it is possible for a mammal to actually breathe the liquid without drowning. Nawal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research looks at the possible use of perflurocarbon-based artificial blood in the treatment of SCA, a genetic condition which is diagnosed in about 250,000 babies worldwide each year.</p> <h2>Ipods: as dangerous as jet engines?</h2> <h3>Thomas Tagoe (Department of Cell Physiology and Pharmacology)</h3> <p>Thomas\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd research is aimed at understanding how noise exposure triggers hearing loss and tinnitus. In the brain there are some nerves which can activate other nerves (excitatory) and some nerves which can prevent other nerves form activating (inhibitory). Thomas\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/\">RNID</a>-funded project investigates how noise exposure influences these excitatory and inhibitory signalling pathways, in particular whether prolonged exposure to sound can cause a lack of inhibition in the central auditory pathway.</p> <h2>Life on the Edge: balancing the needs of nature and people in the remote north-western Himalaya</h2> <dl style=\"width:200px;\" class=\"image-right captioned\"> <dt><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/old-images/fpgr/shujaulmulkkhan.gif/image\" alt=\"shujaulmulkkhan.gif\" title=\"shujaulmulkkhan.gif\" height=\"200\" width=\"200\" /></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:200px;\">Shujaul Mulk Khan</dd> </dl> <h3>Shujaul Mulk Khan (Department of Biology)</h3> <p>Shujaul\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research into a remote Himalayan valley presents a microcosm of how humans and nature interact in mountain ecosystems. About 12% of the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds population live in mountainous areas which are often home to unique planet species, some of which are used by local populations for food, building etc. Shujaul, who is a Lecturer in Botany at Hazara University, Pakistan, surveyed the local communities in this valley while also studying the plant species present to reveal how human society and distinct flora are able to co-exist.</p> <h2>Fusion vaccines for haematological malignancies, the potential for immunotherapy</h2> <h3>Yehia Mohamed (Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation)</h3> <p>Malignant tumours are the second main cause of death worldwide, of which 10% are cancerous blood cells. Treatments available include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and stem cell transplantation but Yehia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research looks at a new approach: immunotherapy.

To ensure that the nests are strong enough to withstand the heavier currents, they must produce more of this glue, which uses up more energy.</p> <p>Dr Barber and his team are observing the fish in their laboratory to see how their behaviour changes for different water flow rates, and are being careful to ensure the conditions are within the spectrum of what the fish would experience in their natural environments.</p> <p>The good news is - the fish appear to be adapting very well.</p> <p>Three-spined sticklebacks are regarded as something of an evolutionary \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsupermodel\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd due to their remarkable ability to adapt to environmental change.</p> <p><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b02x94sm\">You can catch Dr Iain Barber and the stickleback Dad's on BBC's The One Show here</a></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2013/june/current-affairs-make-life-hard-for-stickleback-dads\" class=\"external-link\">Read the press release</a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>er134</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-06-14T08:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2013/december/eu-horizon-2020-is-coming-eu-funding-and-learning-from-colleagues2019-experiences\">     <title>EU Horizon 2020 is coming; EU Funding and learning from colleagues\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experiences</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2013/december/eu-horizon-2020-is-coming-eu-funding-and-learning-from-colleagues2019-experiences</link>     <description>Frank and Katherine May Lecture Theatre, Henry Wellcome Building - 11 Dec 2013, 03:00PM - 05:00PM</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[Speakers to include Professor Peter Andrew, Professor Bambos Kyriacou and Professor Marco Oggioni.
