The KeyNet network is a network of continuously operating GPS reference stations that provides Real Time Kinematic (RTK) capabilities within a Real Time Network (RTN). This allows corrections to be applied to the points as they are being collected, eliminating the need for an adjustment. Several existing control monuments listed in the NSRS database were used as checks within the KeyNet Network. This confirmed network accuracies were being met during the field survey as well as providing a redundancy check on the Trimble VRSnetwork. The Specified local network accuracy of 5cm at the 95% confidence level was met or exceeded. Data analysis was accomplished by comparing ground truth checkpoints with LIDAR points from the edited data set, which were within 1 meter horizontally from the ground truth points. Based on the number of returns and the density of points in this project, it was not necessary to compare to anything further away than 1 meter horizontally from the ground truth points. Note that the edited LIDAR points are simply a subset of the raw LIDAR points. The points that fell above the ground surface on vegetation canopies, buildings, or other obstructions were removed from the data set. Comparisons were also made between the survey points and the LIDAR derived terrain surface. These comparisons provide an additional verification of the LIDAR data against the survey data.</logic>   <complete>Ground Truth data was collected of the three major land cover classes representing 10% of the predominate vegetation dispersed within the area of interest. 20 points were collected in each of the three predominate vegetation classes low vegetation, medium vegetation, and high vegetation, points collected in high vegetation were collected with a Total Station. Pair of points was surveyed using the KeyNet network once completed the total station is used to collect the high vegetation ground class. A Topcon 7000 total station was used to collect all the shots collected in the high vegetation class, due to the limited GPS signal when working in and around tree canopy.</complete>   <posacc>    <horizpa>     <horizpar>There is not a systematic method of testing when testing horizontal accuracy in LiDAR. However this is tested during calibration of the sensor and is rechecked during the comparing of parallel and perpendicular flight lines. Additionally the horizontal accuracy is checked by collecting building corners during the survey. Lines are then digitized representing the building outline and the differences are measure from each individual survey point to the corner of the building outline. Stats are calculated to ensure horizontal tolerances are met. These measurements resulted in an RMSE of .40 meters and equals a .69 meter horizontal accuracy at the 95 % confidence level. Accuracy defined by NSSDA at the 95 % confidence level would be multiplier by 1.7308 times the RMSE.</horizpar>    </horizpa>    <vertacc>     <vertaccr>The accuracy assessment was performed using the NSSDA standard method to compute the root mean square error (RMSE) based on a comparison of ground control points (GCP) and filtered LiDAR data points. Filtered LiDAR data has had vegetation and cultural features removed and by analysis represent bare earth elevations. Testing was performed prior to gridding of the filtered LiDAR data points and construction of the 32-bit ESRI float grid format bare earth tiles. The RMSEz figure was used to compute the vertical National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy (NSSDA). A spatial proximity analysis was used to select edited LiDAR data points contiguous to the relevant GCPs. A search radius decision rule is applied with consideration of terrain complexity, cumulative error and adequate sample size. Cumulative error results from the errors inherent in the various sources of horizontal measurement. These sources include the airborne GPS, GCPs and the uncertainty of the accuracy of the LiDAR data points. This accuracy is achieved prior to the subsampling that occurs through integration with the inertial measurement unit (IMU) positions that are recorded. It is unclear at this time whether the initial accuracy is maintained. The horizontal accuracy of the GCPs is estimated to be in the range of approximately .03 to .04 meters. Finally, sample size was considered. The specification for the National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy is a minimum of 20 points to conduct a statistically significant accuracy evaluation which provides a reasonable approximation of a normal distribution. The intent of the NSSDA is to reflect the geographic area of interest and the distribution of error in the data set (Federal Geographic Data Committee, 1998, Geospatial National Standard for Spatial Data Accuracy, Federal Geographic Data Committee Secretariat, Reston, Virginia, p.3-4). Additional steps were taken to ensure the vertical accuracy of the LiDAR data including: Step 1: Precision Bore sighting (Check Edge-matching) Step 2: Compare the LiDAR data to the Field Survey (The vertical accuracy requirements meet or exceed the required RMSEz of 18.5cm and the vertical accuracy of 36.3cm at the 95% confidence level). Data collected under this task order exceeds the required National Standards for Spatial Database Accuracy (NSSDA) accuracy standards. SVA RMSEz classes collected and tested, results as follows: Urban=.08 meters, Low Veg.=.06 meters, Medium Veg.=.14 meters, and High Veg.= .14 meters. Consolidated Vertical Accuracies (CVA) RMSEz results for this task order =.12 meters. Final accuracy statement for this task order is as follows; Tested .24 meters vertical accuracy at the 95% confidence level.</vertaccr>    </vertacc>   </posacc>   <lineage>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>Northrop Grumman, 3001 Operating Unit</origin>       <pubdate>05302011</pubdate>       <pubtime>Unknown</pubtime>       <title>Shenandoah 1.0m NPS LiDAR</title>       <geoform>raster digital data</geoform>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <srcscale>24000</srcscale>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <mdattim>        <sngdate>         <caldate>20110301</caldate>         <time>unknown</time>        </sngdate>        <sngdate>         <caldate>20110302</caldate>        </sngdate>        <sngdate>         <caldate>20110303</caldate>        </sngdate>        <sngdate>         <caldate>20110304</caldate>        </sngdate>        <sngdate>         <caldate>20110308</caldate>        </sngdate>        <sngdate>         <caldate>20110309</caldate>        </sngdate>       </mdattim>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea>DEM</srccitea>     <srccontr>The Shenandoah 1.0m NPS LiDAR Survey was acquired and processed for the U.S. Geological Survey by the Northrop Grumman, 3001 Operating Unit.</srccontr>     <typesrc>disc</typesrc>    </srcinfo>    <procstep>     <procdesc>The ABGPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and raw scans are collected during the LiDAR aerial survey.
