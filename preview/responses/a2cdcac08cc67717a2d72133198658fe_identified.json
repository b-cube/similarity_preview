A central requirement for PFT models is that they allow sustained coexistence of the PFTs. Here we discuss how this identifies a need to consider predation, parasitism and defence mechanisms together with nutrient acquisition and competition. Although the stepwise addition of complexity is assumed to be useful and feasible, a rapid increase in complexity strongly calls for alternative approaches able to model emergent systemlevel features without a need for detailed representation of all the underlying biological detail.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:781</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:15Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress in oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 129-133</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Allen, J.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Fulton, E.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Top-down, bottom-up or middle-out?

(this volume) invokes foodweb theory and the ideas of complexity theory to guide the construction of models of intermediate complexity, which sacrifice explicit process detail to increase the number of interacting components of the system and simulate the web of feedback loops. This approach has its merits, if best practice modelling guidelines are followed and the method is used well. However, if this is not the case then the fundamental weakness of the intermediate model approach is that it may end up producing models that are over general and therefore not useful. To make the most of the intermediate complexity approach it is essential to keep the tenets of the middle-out approach in mind. Under the middle-out approach computational models are constructed and tested at the levels where we have the most detailed information, building on our existing knowledge and data and coupling a hierarchy of models rather than being swamped in a morass of detail or missing key feedbacks through over-generality.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:782</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:15Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress in oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 66-68</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Anderson, Thomas R.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Mitra, Aditee</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Dysfunctionality in ecosystem models: An underrated pitfall?</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-02-28</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/782</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.09.007</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>Including causal mechanisms in model formulations is the key to predictive success. Yet it would appear that much of our latest (specifically ecophysiological) understanding accruing from phenomological evidence and experimental work is often not being included within model structures. Dysfunctional equations (which fail to capture mechanistic understanding, and which lead to incorrect model behaviour) are often used instead, the use of fixed Monod formulations to simulate multiple-nutrient interactions in phytoplankton, or Holling type II descriptions of resource-limited predatory activity, being typical examples. In some instances, dysfunctional equations may be adopted through sheer ignorance, a worrying prospect given our incomplete knowledge of many processes occurring in marine ecosystems. One wonders, for example, to what extent the parameterisations used in the current generation of complex ecosystem models being developed for climate studies, and the predictions thereof, can be relied upon. Here, we investigate the underlying problems leading to the use of dysfunctional models within marine food web systems, our perusal of the subject suggesting that ignorance is by no means the only factor, other reasons being indifference, inertia, and subservience to simplicity.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:783</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:16Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress in oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 85-88</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Buckley, Lawrence J.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Buckley, Lauren B.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Toward linking ocean models to fish population dynamics</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-02-28</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/783</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.09.009</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>We discuss Lehodey et al.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (2009) approach to linking ocean models to population dynamics of large marine predators, consider its benefits and limitations, and outline alternative approaches.

A new challenge is to dynamically represent zooplankton within marine food webs coupling lower trophic levels to fish and to thereby further our understanding of the role of zooplankton in global change. In this respect, the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrhomboid strategy\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (deYoung et al., 2004) has been suggested as a generic approach to model the various trophic levels of pelagic ecosystems and is deemed to be adaptable to different spatial and temporal frames of applications. The present paper identifies directions to develop zooplankton modelling by combining the skills of modellers, experimentalists, observers and theoreticians. In the first part, we present the main types of existing models, specifying the scientific issues, their characteristic time and space scales, across the ecological organization levels. In the second part, we focus on the strengths and weaknesses of parameterizations for the different processes. Finally in the last part, we make suggestions for improving these parameterizations by combining experiments and observations, using modelling techniques to transfer information across scales and testing theories which can themselves help to organize experimental and modelling research.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:785</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:16Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress in oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 52-65</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Flynn, Kevin J.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Ecological modelling in a sea of variable stoichiometry: Dysfunctionality and the legacy of Redfield and Monod</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-02-28</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/785</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.09.006</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>Traditionally models of oceanic pelagic ecology, which also lay at the heart of general circulation models used for climate change simulations and of models describing coastal ecosystem dynamics have employed descriptions of plankton that assume fixed Redfield elemental compositions as inputs for rectangular-hyperbolic (Monod-type, Holling type II) descriptions of resource-limited growth and predation kinetics. The performances of Redfield\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMonod and variable stoichiometric models are compared with theoretical expectations and experimental data for descriptions of multi-nutrient limited phytoplankton growth and predator\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdprey interactions. Serious deficiencies are revealed in Redfield\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMonod implementations; such constructs have outputs and/or structural logic contrary to empirical biological knowledge. For example, Redfield\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMonod models often employ nutrient limitation as a significant factor controlling phytoplankton growth, and yet biologically such nutrient limitation is associated with significant variation in elemental stoichiometry. One could argue that reliance on such dysfunctional descriptions is unacceptable, especially in an era when increasing political play is made of model simulations and predictions. Biological studies should examine the consumption and fate of all major nutrients, not just of the limiting nutrient, in order to furnish modellers with the mechanistic understanding, and data, to enable a refined description of the organisms responsible for biogeochemical cycling. Modellers, in turn, should embrace existing experimental and phenomenological observations and update their models accordingly. Simplifications in model structure can then be made from a sound knowledge base rather than by making potentially incorrect a priori assumptions.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/closedAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:786</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:16Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress In Oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 43-51</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Frangoulis, C.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Carlotti, F.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Eisenhauer, L.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Zervoudaki, S.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Converting copepod vital rates into units appropriate for biogeochemical models</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-02-28</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/786</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.09.005</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>The conversion of units is one of the difficulties of model parameterisation. Conversion errors may result not only from incorrect choices of conversion factors, but also from incorrect choices of the value itself. In biogeochemical models, mesozooplankton, is the highest trophic level of the food web, and it is very often reduced to a single variable generally considered as a representation of the copepod community, the dominant taxa in mesozooplankton. If this simplifies the information to be obtained for the stock, a correct parameterisation of the processes related to the copepod community is already a tricky task due to the wide range of copepod species, sizes, stages and behaviour. The goal of this paper is to improve the communication between experimentalists and modellers by giving indications for the conversion of copepod vital rates from experimental to biogeochemical model units. This includes the choice of values, conversion factors, terminology distinction and the scale transfer. To begin with, we briefly address the common problem of the conversion of a rate per individual to a rate per mass. Then, we focus on unit conversion problems for each specific rate and give recommendations. Finally, we discuss the problem of scale transfer between the level of organisation at which the rate value is measured at characteristic time and space-scales versus the level of representation of the corresponding process in the model, with its different characteristic time and space-scales.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:787</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:16Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress in oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 121-128</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Hannah, Charles</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Vezina, Alain</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>St John, Mike</dc:creator>   <dc:title>The case for marine ecosystem models of intermediate complexity</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-02-28</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/787</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.09.015</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>Marine ecosystem models are reasonably proficient at simulating physically-driven features such as spring blooms. However, the demands on these models are shifting to complex biological issues such as functional diversity, and changes in ecosystems and their services such as exploited fish stocks and carbon sequestration. Current ecosystem models generally use a food web structure reduced to its bare essentials. A consequence of the simplified structure is that they are specialized to a particular time, place and ecosystem state and thereby have limited ability to evolve into a substantially different state as a result of internal dynamics or changes in external forcing. We use food web theory and the ideas from complexity theory to argue that an improved representation of the structure of marine food webs is essential for the next generation of marine ecosystem models. Here we propose that a useful guiding principle for model design is provided by earth system models of intermediate complexity; a willingness to sacrifice process detail in order to increase the number of interacting components in the system and simulate the web of feedback loops.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:788</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:16Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-euro-basin</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Progress in oceanography: 84 (2010) no. 1-2, pp. 16-19</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Hofmann, Eileen E.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Plankton functional group models \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd An assessment</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-02-28</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/788</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1016/j.pocean.2009.09.002</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>This Discussant\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Report provides a summary of the discussions that followed presentation of the approaches and ideas described in Thingstad et al.

Here, we provide an example of a modeling approach with definitions of several pelagic mid-trophic functional groups. This application includes six different groups characterized by their vertical behavior, i.e., occurrence of diel migration between epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers. Parameterization of the dynamics of these components is based on a temperature-linked time development relationship. Estimated parameters of this relationship are close to those predicted by a model based on a theoretical description of the allocation of metabolic energy at the cellular level, and that predicts a species metabolic rate in terms of its body mass and temperature. Then, a simple energy transfer from primary production is used, justified by the existence of constant slopes in log\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlog biomass size spectrum relationships. Recruitment, ageing, mortality and passive transport with horizontal currents, taking into account vertical behavior of organisms, are modeled by a system of advection\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddiffusion-reaction equations. Temperature and currents averaged in each vertical layer are provided independently by an Ocean General Circulation Model and used to drive the mid-trophic level (MTL) model. Simulation outputs are presented for the tropical Pacific Ocean to illustrate how different temperature and oceanic circulation conditions result in spatial and temporal lags between regions of high primary production and regions of aggregation of mid-trophic biomass. Predicted biomasses are compared against available data. Data requirements to evaluate outputs of these types of models are discussed, as well as the prospects that they offer both for ecosystem models of lower and upper trophic levels.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/264933</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><resumptionToken cursor=\"0\" completeListSize=\"80\" expirationDate=\"2015-03-13T23:10:08Z\">user-euro-basin___mYlP6a</resumptionToken></ListRecords> </OAI-PMH>  ",
