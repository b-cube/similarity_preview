NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has recently completed its Critical Design Review&#13; (CDR) of a new dual Ka and S-band ground system for the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)&#13; Mission. SDO, the flagship mission under the new Living with a Star Program Office, is one of&#13; GSFC's most recent large-scale in-house missions. The observatory is scheduled for launch in&#13; August 2008 from the Kennedy Space Center aboard an Atlas-5 expendable launch vehicle.&#13; Unique to this mission is an extremely challenging science data capture requirement. The&#13; mission is required to capture 95% of all observation opportunities with a completeness of&#13; 99.99%. Due to the continuous, high volume (150 Mbps) science data rate, no on-board&#13; storage of science data will be implemented on this mission. With the observatory placed in a&#13; geo-synchronous orbit at 36,000 kilometers within view of dedicated ground stations, the ground&#13; system will in effect implement a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdreal-time\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd science data pipeline with appropriate data&#13; accounting, data storage, data distribution, data recovery, and automated system failure&#13; detection and correction to keep the science data flowing continuously to three separate&#13; Science Operations Centers (SOCs). Data storage rates of ~ 42 Tera-bytes per month are&#13; expected. The Mission Operations Center (MOC) will be based at GSFC and is designed to be&#13; highly automated. Three SOCs will share in the observatory operations, each operating their&#13; own instrument. Remote operations of a multi-antenna ground station in White Sands, New&#13; Mexico from the MOC is part of the design baseline.

Brian; Platt, Donald The purpose of this paper is to discuss, at the system level, a theoretical spacecraft and mission&#13; named DIRE (Dactyl-Ida Rendezvous Experiment). The spacecraft will travel to the asteroid&#13; pair Dactyl and Ida, which is approximately 3 AU from the Sun, to achieve the following mission&#13; objectives:&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Measure the magnetic fields around the asteroid pair and each object individually.&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Take multispectral images at various altitudes to determine surface regolith composition&#13; and distribution.&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Using ground penetrating radar, attempt to discern the hidden structure of Ida and Dactyl&#13; and answer this question: are asteroids actually many rocks loosely coalesced into a&#13; single body and held together by gravity, rather than a huge monolith?&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Descend autonomously to each asteroid and retrieve samples of regolith, using&#13; micropropulsion systems. Analysis of regolith will then be performed with on board&#13; systems.&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Near the end of the mission launch a ground-penetrating explosive into Dactyl in an&#13; attempt to split into its subparts. The purpose here is to develop a technique for&#13; neutralizing a possible Earth damaging asteroid by separating it into smaller, less&#13; dangerous objects. DIRE will then make radar measurements of the ensuing asteroid&#13; breakup and determine if and how the asteroid re-coalesces.&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Get a first ever look at material from within an asteroid, after the explosive splits Dactyl.&#13; This mission uses features of previous spacecraft missions and adds a never before attempted&#13; explosive penetrator to probe deeply and precisely into an asteroid. Thus, this mission will add to&#13; deep space object science and perhaps provide a way for mankind to defend itself against them.
