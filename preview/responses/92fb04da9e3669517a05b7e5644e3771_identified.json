The datasets in this series represent the following component polygon layers: Hydrometric Areas with Coastline, Hydrometric Areas without Coastline, Groups, Sections, and Catchments. Each layer represents a different level of spatial detail. The coarsest level, Hydrometric Areas, is provided in two versions to meet differing user needs. Each Hydrometric Area is made up of one or more Groups. Each Group carries a name constructed from names of the major river flowing through the Group, the major river flowing into the Group, the major river into which the Group flows, and in some cases also from local county names. Each Group is made up of smaller units called Sections. A Section is the drainage area of a watercourse between two confluences. Only confluences of named watercourses were considered. Similarly to Groups, each Section carries a name constructed from names of the major river flowing through the Section, the major river flowing into the Section, and the major river into which the Section flows. Catchments represent the full area upstream from an outlet of every Section. Polygons within each layer do not have gaps and, with the exception of Catchments, polygons within one layer do not overlap. Identifiers and attributes have been calculated so that direct upstream and direct downstream units within the same layer and also related units across layers can be easily selected. The Hydrometric Areas with Coastline layer covers Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but all other layers currently cover Great Britain only as no dataset with river geometries and names with suitable detail is available for Northern Ireland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>watershed</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>section</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>group</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometric area</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-05T15:15:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/10d419c8-8f65-4b85-a78a-3d6e0485fa1f\">     <title>Integrated Hydrological Units of the United Kingdom: Catchments</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/10d419c8-8f65-4b85-a78a-3d6e0485fa1f</link>     <description>This dataset is part of Integrated Hydrological Units (IHU) of the UK, a set of geographical reference units for hydrological purposes including river flow measurement and hydrometric data collection.

Hydrometric Areas are the coarsest units of the IHU in terms of spatial resolution. This dataset represents the same entities as the Hydrometric Areas with Coastline. The coastline of Hydrometric Areas without Coastline follows the boundaries of the CEH Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model, from which IHU were derived, while the coastline used in Hydrometric Areas with Coastline was derived from Ordnance Survey data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>watershed</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-30T13:26:30Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5e7b868b-890f-4246-b818-026ff19e60e2\">     <title>Conservation biological control experiments data, 2005-2009 - RELU Re-bugging the system: promoting adoption of alternative pest management strategies in field crop </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5e7b868b-890f-4246-b818-026ff19e60e2</link>     <description>This set of conservation biological control experiments data was collected as part of five field experiments investigating agricultural biological control techniques, particularly the effect of wild field margins on pests and predators.  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.   Despite the widespread concerns regarding the use of pesticides in food production and the availability of potentially viable biological pest control strategies in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems, the UK cereal crop production remains a bastion of pesticide use. This project aimed to understand further the reasons for this lack of adoption, using the control of summer cereal aphids as a case study.  Reasons for this lack of adoption of biocontrol remain a complex interplay of both technical and economic problems. Economists highlight the potential path dependency of an industry to continue to employ a suboptimal technology, caused by past dynamics of adoption resulting in differential private cost structures of each technique. Further, risk aversion on the part of farmers regarding the perceived efficacy of a new technology may also limit up-take. This may be particularly important when IPM rests on portfolios of technologies and when little scientific understanding exists on the effect of portfolio and scale of adoption on overall efficacy. Faced with this, farmers will not adopt a socially superior IPM technology and there exists a clear need for public policy action. This action may take the form of minimising uncertainty through carefully designed research programs, government funding and dissemination of the results of large-scale research studies or direct public support for farm landscape and farm system changes that can promote biocontrol.  This research looked at alternatives to the use of insecticides in arable agriculture and the difficulties facing producers in switching over to them. Two approaches were explored: habitat manipulations, to encourage predators and parasites, and using naturally occurring odours to manipulate predator distribution as model technologies. Scale and portfolio effects on biocontrol efficacy have been investigated in controlled and field scale experiments. Aim is to improve the way research and development of new products and techniques are carried out to help break the dependence on chemical pesticides.  'Semiochemical experiment data, 2005-2009 - RELU Re-bugging the system: promoting adoption of alternative pest management strategies in field crop systems' data from this same research project are also available through the CEH Information Gateway.  In addition, socio-economic research has been used to help direct natural science research into the development and evaluation of a combination of habitat management and semiochemical push-pull strategies of appropriate scale and complementarity to yield viable, commercially attractive and sustainable alternatives to the use of insecticides in cereal crop agriculture. These socio-economic data are available through the UK Data Archive under study number 6960 (see online resources).

Despite the widespread concerns regarding the use of pesticides in food production and the availability of potentially viable biological pest control strategies in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems, the UK cereal crop production remains a bastion of pesticide use.   This project aimed to understand further the reasons for this lack of adoption, using the control of summer cereal aphids as a case study. Reasons for this lack of adoption of biocontrol remain a complex interplay of both technical and economic problems. Economists highlight the potential path dependency of an industry to continue to employ a suboptimal technology, caused by past dynamics of adoption resulting in differential private cost structures of each technique. Further, risk aversion on the part of farmers regarding the perceived efficacy of a new technology may also limit up-take. This may be particularly important when IPM rests on portfolios of technologies and when little scientific understanding exists on the effect of portfolio and scale of adoption on overall efficacy. Faced with this, farmers will not adopt a socially superior IPM technology and there exists a clear need for public policy action. This action may take the form of minimising uncertainty through carefully designed research programs, government funding and dissemination of the results of large-scale research studies or direct public support for farm landscape and farm system changes that can promote biocontrol.   This research looked at alternatives to the use of insecticides in arable agriculture and the difficulties facing producers in switching over to them. Two approaches were explored: habitat manipulations, to encourage predators and parasites, and using naturally occurring odours to manipulate predator distribution as model technologies. Scale and portfolio effects on biocontrol efficacy have been investigated in controlled and field scale experiments. Aim is to improve the way research and development of new products and techniques are carried out to help break the dependence on chemical pesticides.   Conservation biological control experiments data investigating the effect of wild field margins on pests and predators, from this same research project, are also available through the CEH Information Gateway.   In addition, socio-economic research has been used to help direct natural science research into the development and evaluation of a combination of habitat management and semiochemical push-pull strategies of appropriate scale and complementarity to yield viable, commercially attractive and sustainable alternatives to the use of insecticides in cereal crop agriculture. These socio-economic data are available through the UK Data Archive under study number 6960 (see online resources).

Hydrometric Areas are used to organise river flow measurement and hydrometric data collection in the UK. Hydrometric Areas are either integral river catchments having one or more outlets to the sea or tidal estuary, or they may include several contiguous river catchments having topographical similarity but separate tidal outlets. In mainland Britain they are numbered from 1 to 97 in clockwise order around the coast commencing in north east Scotland. The larger islands and groups of islands are numbered from 100-108. Ireland has a unified numbering system from 1 to 40 commencing with the River Foyle catchment and circulating clockwise; not all Irish Hydrometric Areas, however, have an outlet to the coast. Only those Hydrometric Areas covering Great Britain and Northern Ireland are included in this dataset. The boundaries between hydrometric areas correspond to catchment boundaries as digitally-derived from CEH Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model (IHDTM) using a catchment definition program. It should be noticed that the Northern Ireland data are clipped to its political boundary so not every Hydrometric Area in this region is completely represented. The naming and numbering convention for the hydrometric areas in Great Britain was originally defined by the Inland Water Survey Committee (and first published in the Surface Water Year-Book of Great Britain 1936-37). For Northern Ireland the system was developed by a multi-agency working group in the 1970s (and first published in Surface Water: United Kingdom 1971-73. Note that full citations of those two publications are provided as additional information source. This dataset represent the same entities as the IHU Hydrometric Areas of the UK without Coastline, however, the outer boundaries of the units follow coastline published by the Ordnance Survey (Meridian 2), rather than the boundaries of the CEH Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometric areas</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-06-24T13:10:29Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5dc179dc-f692-49ba-9326-a6893a503f6e\">     <title>Gridded estimates of daily and monthly areal rainfall for the United Kingdom (1890-2012) [CEH-GEAR]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5dc179dc-f692-49ba-9326-a6893a503f6e</link>     <description>1 km gridded estimates of daily and monthly rainfall for Great-Britain and Northern Ireland (together with approximately 3000 km2 of catchment in the Republic of Ireland) from 1890 to 2012. The rainfall estimates are derived from the Met Office national database of observed precipitation. To derive the estimates, monthly and daily (when complete month available) precipitation totals from the UK rain gauge network are used. The natural neighbour interpolation methodology, including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall, was used to generate the daily and monthly estimates. The estimated rainfall on a given day refers to the rainfall amount precipitated in 24 hours between 9am on that day until 9am on the following day.  The CEH-GEAR dataset has been developed according to the guidance provided in BS 7843-4:2012.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Daily</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>monthly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Precipitation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>areal rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>raingauge</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-06-19T09:24:49Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a97dc330-cb83-4b34-b79a-6ceab7fac8cc\">     <title>The Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) core monitoring data from river catchments</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a97dc330-cb83-4b34-b79a-6ceab7fac8cc</link>     <description>Core monitoring data collected from river water as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS). The Land Ocean Interaction Study was a Natural Environment Research Council thematic programme which ran from 1992 to 2000 and involved over 360 scientists from 11 research institutes and 27 universities. The LOIS project was designed to study coastal processes and investigations covered river catchments, estuaries and coastal seas and their long-term evolution, air-sea interaction and shelf-edge interactions with the open ocean. The river catchment core monitoring includes the following data available for download: continuous in situ measurements of pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature; on site measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature; major ions and nutrients; herbicides; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorobenzenes (CB) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides; triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticides; and trace elements. Supporting documentation contains a list of all determinands measured and a list of sites, their locations and the frequency of sampling for each set of measurements.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T16:07:35Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/72ed6237-aedf-43a7-b9e3-eef95320a2bb\">     <title>Chemical contaminants in White-tailed sea eagle eggs - Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/72ed6237-aedf-43a7-b9e3-eef95320a2bb</link>     <description>Data from analyses of addled and deserted sea eagle eggs collected by licensed collectors in Scotland.

Samples were selected from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Archive. Archived livers from birds that had died between 1998 and 2009 from central England, directly east and within 250 km of the Welsh border, were analysed. Data are presented as one table and two supporting files containing metadata.   The Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) is a long-term, national monitoring scheme that quantifies the concentrations of contaminants in the livers and eggs of selected species of predatory and fish-eating birds in Britain. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacky Chaplow</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>liver</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sparrowhawk</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Accipter nisus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bird</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bird of prey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tissue</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Between 1998 and 2009</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>time</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-01-29T15:42:31Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5fdccbe5-066b-4130-8431-d6389c31cea2\">     <title>Concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) eggs in the UK.</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5fdccbe5-066b-4130-8431-d6389c31cea2</link>     <description>Data on long term trends in Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) eggs.  Samples were selected from the Predatory Bird Monitoring Scheme (PBMS) Archive. Failed or abandoned sparrowhawk eggs were taken from nests by licensed egg collectors and archived as part of the monitoring activities of the PBMS in the UK. The period studied was 1985 to 2007. Data are presented in three tables including detected PBDEs, interpolated PBDEs and sample properties which are described in a metadata file.
