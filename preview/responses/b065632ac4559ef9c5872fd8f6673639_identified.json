It was not until the protection of a breeding pair of ospreys in the 1950s at <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/l/lochgarten/\">Loch Garten</a> in Scotland that a slow increase in numbers began, and there are now more than 230 breeding pairs of the iconic fish-eating bird of prey.</p> <p>Despite the availability of suitable natural habitats outside of Scotland, the osprey will return to breed close to the site where they were reared, a behaviour generally known as natal philopatry.</p> <p>Tim argues that to help the ospreys expand to southern Britain much faster, osprey chicks should be brought from Scotland into those parts of the country. This has been done at <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.rutlandwater.org.uk/\">Rutland Water </a>where 64 ospreys are now breeding successfully \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and with just a short trip from the University via the A47, you can see them firsthand.</p> <ul><li><a class=\"external-link\"

of Leicester have hit upon unique forms of spinal nerve activity that shape output of nerve cell networks controlling motor behaviours. The research used zebrafish because their motor networks are similar to humans.</p> <p>The breakthrough in the<a title=\"Biology\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/Biology\" class=\"internal-link\"> Department of Biology</a> is announced today in the journal <em>Current Biology</em>. The University of Leicester research team was interested in how nerve cells networks dedicated to production of rhythmic motor behaviour (such as walking and swimming) form.</p> <p>The behaviours were first noticed two days after Christmas and according to Dr McDearmid it was one of the best Christmas presents they had ever had. The researchers say they have a long way yet to go in the study, however, it is believed that long term, understanding o<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>f this process might help determine what goes wrong in diseases that affect spinal cord function.</p> <p>Dr McDearmid worked with Dr Huaxia Tong, a postdoc who co-authored the three-year study which was funded by the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/home/home.aspx\">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</a> (BBSRC).</p> <ul><li><a title=\"Unique spinal nerve cell activity discovery announced by University of Leicester biologists\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2012/november/unique-spinal-nerve-cell-activity-discovery-announced-by-university-of-leicester-biologists\" class=\"internal-link\">University press release</a><br /></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>pt91</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-11-08T17:14:46Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/october/putting-the-wind-back-into-the-willows-river-restoration-project-to-give-back-to-community\">     <title>There's something in the water: project aims to restore river to community</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/october/putting-the-wind-back-into-the-willows-river-restoration-project-to-give-back-to-community</link>     <description>Collaboration between University of Leicester and the Welland Rivers Trust works to restore the nature and importance of river to historical town.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/people/harper\">Dr David Harper</a>, of our <a title=\"Biology\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/Biology\" class=\"internal-link\">Department of Biology</a>, is leading experts including ecologists and community members in the restoration of a watercourse through a historic Leicester market town.</p> <p>The half-a-million-pound project aims to restore the River Welland at Market Harborough. Dr David Harper, whose career has been dedicated to conservation, said the aim of the project was to put nature back in the river and give the river back to Market Harborough itself.</p> <p>The project was made possible after University of Leicester helped set up a charitable company,<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.wellandriverstrust.org.uk/\">The Welland Rivers Trust</a>, one of 40 such trusts trying to bring the vitality back to Britain\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds waterways. The trusts seek to make members of the public aware of rivers and to encourage sustainability.</p> <p>This is not the Trust's first project and it was earlier successful in mobilising various public and private groups in Stamford, bringing them together to work on the restoration of major public assets within the town that have been neglected for decades.</p> <p>If you would like to get involved feel free to attend the River Welland restoration project meeting that takes place on November 1 at 7pm at the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=angel+hotel+market+harborough&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=uk&amp;hq=angel+hotel&amp;hnear=0x48776ddc4264a10b:0x8a2a1a22a6b8a7c4,Market+Harborough,+Leicestershire&amp;cid=0,0,229001044914202694&amp;ei=Xdp2UO_RN6ub1AXbnIDACA&amp;ved=0CKEBEPwSMAA\">Angel Hotel, Market Harborough </a>.</p> <ul><li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2012/october/restoration-project-aims-to-give-river-back-to-market-harborough\">Press release</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>hct16</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainability</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conservation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-10-11T16:06:16Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/december/the-parasites-that-like-it-hot\">     <title>The parasites that like it hot</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/december/the-parasites-that-like-it-hot</link>     <description>Worms infecting fish grow four times faster in warmer waters, and can even control the host's behaviour, new study finds</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Parasitic worms that infect stickleback fish prefer warm temperatures, according to a study carried out by Dr Iain Barber and doctoral student Vicki Macnab of our <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\">Department of Biology</a>. They compared infected fish living at 20\\ufffd\\ufffdC to those living at 15\\ufffd\\ufffdC, and found that in warmer water the worms grew four times faster whilst the fish growth slowed. The worms like it warm - but the effect on fish is devastating, reducing their size and interfering with reproduction.</p> <p>Those pesky parasites can also manipulate their hosts. A follow-up study found evidence that fish infected with the worms changed their behaviour and showed a preference for warmer temperatures. This trickery allows the worm to enjoy balmy temperatures and rapid growth - all at the expense of its poor host.</p> <p>The research shows how global warming could potentially affect the balance between parasite and host. As global temperatures rise, the warm water benefits parasites, but the knock-on effects on fish populations could be serious and devastating. The worms' increased growth rate and size also means they go on to lay more eggs, further increasing the parasite population.</p> <p>The research has been published in the journal <em>Global Change Biology</em>.</p> <ul><li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2011/december/global-warming-changes-balance-between-parasite-and-host-in-fish-new-study\">University Press Release</a></li><li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2011.02595.x/abstract;jsessionid=D33576C95BD9949995C14AB0123B547A.d01t04?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+17+Dec+from+10-13+GMT+for+IT+maintenance.\">Some (worms) like it hot: fish parasites grow faster in warmer water, and alter host thermal preferences</a> in&nbsp;<em>Global Change Biology</em></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>fi17</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2011-12-14T16:14:22Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
