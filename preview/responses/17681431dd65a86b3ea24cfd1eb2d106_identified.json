In the Member Characteristic Data, each member   of each subsystem is the unit of observation and the national   characteristics of each member are reported. In the Subsystem Data,   21 subsystems constitute the unit of observation, with variables   recording the number of members, wars, alliances, and polarity of   each subsystem. The War Data report the war behavior of each of   the 21 subsystems, with one record for each war as reported in the  four major studies of war from which they were compiled.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1649\" cycle=\"P1\">1649</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1963\" cycle=\"P1\">1963</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Nations considered to be part of the international system  in the period 1649-1963.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) Richardson, Lewis F.
