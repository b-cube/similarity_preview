An Evaluation of Information Literacy Standards: A Mixed Method Approach Utilizing the Judgments of National Board Certified Teachers Willer, David B Information literacy--the ability to recognize when information is needed and then to locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information--is an essential skill set for 21st century students. In order for students to be prepared for college and career readiness, the component skills of information literacy should be explicit in educational policy documents that establish standards for student learning (Partnership for 21st Century Skills, 2009). Standard statements are guides for developing curriculum and instructional programs for students, and therefore should reflect what is known of cognitive development and must be clearly written so that all stakeholders--including policy makers, teachers, parents, and students--understand what students are being asked to do (Kendall, 2001).  This research project sought to establish to what extent information-literacy-related standard statements represent developmentally appropriate grade-level designations. I did this by determining how well the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) and the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) standard statements reflect the information problem-solving process as represented by the Big6 model, and to what extent expert, experienced teachers (as represented by National Board Certificated Teachers [NBCTs] in the state of Washington) agree with both the grade-level, developmental appropriateness and the importance of teaching from these standard statements. The research process utilized a mixed-method design, consisting of a content analysis of the standard statements, a quantitative survey of NBCTs, and a series of four focus groups for explanatory feedback on the results of the survey. Standard statements from CCSS and AASL were first sorted into Big6 stages (Task Definition, Information Seeking Strategies, Location and Access, Use of Information, Synthesis, Evaluation) and analyzed for the clarity of writing and the number of tasks involved. The content analysis of the standard statements found that the CCSS emphasized Big6 stage five (synthesis), while lacking three of the Big6 stages of the information problem solving process (task definition, information seeking strategies, and evaluation). The AASL standard statements included all six of the information problem solving stages, but both task definition and evaluation were underrepresented. A survey then was created using the standard statements that represented three Big6 stages. This survey was sent electronically to NBCTs in the state of Washington. Ninety-six NBCTs completed the survey. Volunteers were recruited from the survey respondents to form four focus groups to provide explanations of the survey results from the participants' views. Findings indicate that there is disagreement between NBCTs on the grade level designations assigned in the standard statements. Subjects were able to match 67% of second-grade standard statements as belonging to second grade, but only 49% of fifth-grade standard statements as belonging to fifth grade, and only 29% at eighth grade. However, in the section of the survey where respondents examined the standard statements closest to their own grade level, the NBCTs did tend to agree with both the developmental appropriateness and the importance of teaching from the standard statements. This finding differs with the results of the first half of the survey and points to potential issues with the clarity of the standards and perhaps with teacher professional development. Without having the grade-level context, teachers had difficulty placing standard statements at the grade level intended by the authors of the standard statements. Whether this discrepancy is due to the lack of clarity of the standard statements, the lack of knowledge of the teachers, or perhaps the fact that teachers being given the grade level before the survey predisposes them to think this was an appropriate placement, is unclear and is therefore an area for further research. The major contributions of this work point to the need 1) for the entire information problem-solving process to be explicitly included in national policy documents such as the CCSS and the AASL standards, so that the component skills of information literacy can be consistently reflected in and taught from standards statements for each grade level in increasing complexity;  and 2) for greater collaboration between the writers of standards statements and classroom teachers with the aim of creating standard statements that are comprehensible to all stakeholders, including parents and students.

As we move through our everyday activities, we make decisions. Many are routine, do not involve risk or focus on a single issue. We know what to expect. Some decisions, however, entail risk and uncertain outcomes. Such decisions are referred to as \"high stakes\" This dissertation determined how time pressure and emotion influence people's information behavior when engaging in high stakes decision-making within the home buying domain. Additionally, the study tested Chatman's Theory of Normative Behavior (Chatman, 2000) and ascertained the helpfulness of deciders' Information Grounds (Fisher, Durrance, &amp; Hinton, 2004). By examining these phenomena, I expand the information behavior knowledge base. Employing an exploratory approach, I performed a deep, reflective ersatz home buying experience, conducted 33 semi-structured interviews using a timeline strategy and carried out eight observations with participants from the Seattle, Washington metropolitan area. Participants included homebuyers and home buying stakeholders such as real estate agents, lenders and escrow agents. Data were collected from April 2012 through March 2013. Findings revealed that \"information use\" induce emotion and a sense of time pressure, whereas all other \"non-information use\" behaviors are propelled by emotion and time pressure. The study also identified the emergent theme \"information use by proxy\" phenomenon wherein emotions prompt people to forgo information responsibility and enlist trusted surrogates to use information on their behalf.  Further, findings show that emotion and time pressure have the ability to alter one's routine information behavior, which can result in shared dyadic information behavior between couples. Moreover, the behavior has implications for such relationships as found in the business world, academia, artistic endeavors and other collaborations (Papadopoulou, Lee, Fisher, 2013).  From theory testing, the study found that Chatman's Theory of Normative Behavior explains high stakes deciders' information behavior, but demonstrates limitations regarding the \"information behavior\" aspect of the theory. As a result, I propose a new, holistic information behavior definition to buttress Chatman's theoretical framework. The study also ascertained that Fisher's Information Grounds provide helpful information for most, but not all high stakes decision makers since sharing information with strangers went against one's nature, information was not relevant or trustworthy or people had insufficient time to socialize. Social information used for light conversation, however, was considered valuable to home buying stakeholders as such information helps to build and maintain relationships, which is viewed as a vital component of successful businesses in the competitive field of residential real estate. Lastly, study findings demonstrate relevance to other fields like medicine, emergency and disaster management or social and political science as issues of emotion and time pressure are likely to present in myriad and unanticipated ways.

Interpersonal knowledge exchanges disseminate temporally good solutions across the organization, encouraging organizational members to create solutions based on these good ideas. The recombination of individual knowledge, however, leads to increasingly similar knowledge bases and a decline in organizational knowledge diversity, thus reducing the chance of creating even better solutions in the future. The success of knowledge exchanges or creation is significantly influenced by individuals' leveraging of social capital, which mostly resides in informal organizational structure. The outcome of social capital leveraging relies not only on the opportunity presented to an individual (determined by the individual's position in an organizational social network), but also on the individual's motivation and ability to seize that opportunity. Additionally, social capital goes through complex structural changes while being leveraged, thus affecting its subsequent impacts. Considering all the above issues, this dissertation study investigated how overall organizational problem-solving performance would be affected by individual members' autonomous leveraging of social capital for knowledge exchange or creation purposes. The research method, agent-based modeling (ABM), provided a unique perspective on this question while other approaches cannot. It allowed to account for emergent collective outcomes by dynamic and decentralized individual interactions. The simulation results suggested non-linear relationships between organizational problem-solving performance and (a) individual members' motivation to leverage social capital, (b) individual members' preference on what social capital to leverage, and (c) the impact of existing social capital. This study advanced the understandings of organizational ambidexterity, organizational social capital, and organizational networks. The agent-based model developed in this study can benefit future research.

The expanded access to millions of books provided by large-scale digitization initiatives (LSDIs) like Google Books and the Open Content Alliance (OCA) has the potential to reshape myriad social structures; yet, despite this potential, they remain underassessed as social phenomena. This dissertation seeks to provide a foundation for such assessment by situating LSDIs in historical context. Specifically, it argues that LSDIs derive from the same basic urge to provide free, widespread public information access that spurred the creation of the public library movement in nineteenth century America, and that through parallel examination of these phenomena, the older can help to illuminate the newer. Methodologically, the dissertation comprises a nested comparative case study analysis of the early years of the two LSDIs already noted and two early American public library systems - the Boston Public Library and the Carnegie Libraries - employing a theoretical lens informed by structuration theory and social construction of technologies. The research interrogates the motivations, intended user base and collection scope, and initial implementation of each initiative, as well as the relationships between these elements. In order to investigate these questions for the two public libraries, primary archival research was carried out at three physical archives and online. For the digitization initiatives, eighteen semi-structured interviews with project leadership were conducted, and supplemented by other primary and secondary source accounts. Data analysis for all cases followed an analytical-inductive approach, in which all 197 primary source documents were qualitatively coded in two iterations. The dissertation provides an in-depth examination of the motivations, definitions, and implementations underlying each case, with a full chapter devoted to each one. It then concludes by drawing parallels and contrasts between the four cases along each of these lines. The themes explored in the conclusion include (1) the inequalities of power and mediation among stakeholder groups in each case; (2) the role of personal passions, principles, and pragmatics in motivating these projects; (3) the boundaries on the \"universal\" user and the \"comprehensive\" collection; and (4) the procedural and structural features that seem to characterize this type of project, especially in terms of leadership styles, standardization and systematization of procedures and infrastructures, the issue of structural persistence, and the initial absence of guidance for users.
