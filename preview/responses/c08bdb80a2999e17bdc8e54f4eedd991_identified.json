IMUs are sometimes augmented by magnetometers, which provide heading information by measuring the earth magnetic field, and barometers for measuring atmospheric pressure to determine the relative altitude of an object.  Such motion and position measurement and processing units can be used in a myriad of applications including robotics, gaming, user interfaces, unmanned air vehicles, and IoT.&#13; They can also enable in-door navigation through sensor fusion when GPS is not reliably available or where higher resolution is required. The gyroscope resolution and drift have been the bottleneck in achieving accurate and&#13; extended periods of navigation using silicon IMU chips.   High-Q bulk&#13; acoustic wave (BAW) modes of a silicon resonator can be used to sense&#13; rotation around all three axes without being affected by linear motion.   If&#13; these modes have identical frequencies and are coupled through Coriolis effect (i.e. gyroscopic modes), the sensitivity of the device is amplified by the Q-factor of the modes, which can reach a few millions, reducing power consumption and improving sensitivity.  This talk will discuss strategies to integrate, operate and self-calibrate high performing MEMS inertial sensors using CMOS interface ICs and present a scalable manufacturing platform that enables the co-integration of a wide array of MEMS and NEMS sensors and actuators with CMOS for creation of 3D Integrated Microsystems. The nano-gap capacitive transducers implemented using the HARPSSTM process enable system-on-chip (SOC) integration of all IMU components with many more sensor and actuator using a foundry-compatible monolithic process.

Richard Feynman in his now famous 1959 talk entitled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Plenty of&#13; Room at the Bottom,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd envisioned a world of atomically precise manufacturing&#13; that would fuel advancements in information storage, computing, and other&#13; fields, though he had only a few rudimentary concepts of how to achieve such&#13; a goal at the time.  Move forward to 2015 where the semiconductor industry&#13; routinely manufactures circuit elements that are below 40 nm in size and the&#13; data storage industry is poised to manufacture and sell bit patterned media&#13; with even smaller magnetic elements.  While we have achieved many of the&#13; feats Feynman originally envisioned in his original talk, there is still&#13; plenty of room at the bottom in 2-D and 3-D geometries that cannot yet be&#13; accessed using truly high volume manufacturing techniques.  This talk will&#13; first present a view of current nanomanufacturing capabilities and the&#13; challenges being faced going forward as attempts are made to develop high&#13; volume methods for fabricating sub-30 nm size device features for&#13; microelectronics applications.  The remaining majority of the talk will focus&#13; on the directed self-assembly of block copolymers as one possible method that&#13; could achieve this goal of high volume manufacturing of device elements with&#13; sizes down into sub-10 nm length scales.&#13; &#13; Underlying much of what we envision as nanomanufacturing for functional&#13; devices is the ability to form nanoscale two dimensional and three&#13; dimensional structures in various organic and inorganic materials.  For&#13; example, all modern electronic devices (e.g. computers, cell phones, tablets,&#13; etc.) rely on the use of microprocessors and memory devices that possess&#13; integrated circuit (IC) device features smaller than 50 nm in size.  The&#13; critical and enabling technologies for mass producing such microelectronic&#13; devices are the combination of lithographic materials, processes, and tools&#13; used to pattern the nanoscale device elements that constitute the transistor&#13; device active layers and the subsequent electrical interconnect layers.&#13; However, continuing to scale such devices down in feature size faces a number&#13; of challenges in terms of the materials, tools, and economics of such micro-&#13; and nanofabrication technologies.  Solutions to these problems will require&#13; new materials and new material processing approaches.  The first part of this&#13; talk will quickly review the current state of the art in such lithographic&#13; nanopatterning technologies and some of the current challenges being faced by&#13; traditional lithography and IC manufacturing methods. The second part of the&#13; talk will address how we are applying chemical engineering, materials&#13; science, and synthetic chemistry concepts to develop solutions to these&#13; challenges.  Specifically, we will look at the role self-assembly may play in&#13; the future of nanomanufacturing through the use of block copolymer directed&#13; self-assembly techniques (BCP DSA).  Block copolymers have the natural&#13; tendency to micro-phase separate at length scales commensurate with the&#13; polymer chain dimensions, i.e. on the order of 1 to 100 nm in size.  Left&#13; alone to micro-phase separate in the bulk, such block copolymers form&#13; nanostructured but disordered morphologies.  However, when combined with&#13; templating surfaces patterned with traditional lithography techniques,&#13; nanometer length scale features with the long range order required for&#13; nanomanufacturing can be achieved.  This talk will highlight the synergy of&#13; combining experimental and molecular modeling approaches to attack such&#13; problems and will discuss current achievements and remaining challenges in&#13; the field of BCP DSA.
