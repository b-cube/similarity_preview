While this speech comes down to us among the body of <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>&#8217; orations, it was probably written by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Apollodorus</name> on behalf of a plaintiff (whose name we do not know) in his suit against <name type=\"person\">Evergus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Mnesibulus</name>, whom the plaintiff charges with having given false testimony in a previous suit.  This suit is the culmination of a long and somewhat complicated history of acrimony between the plaintiff and <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>.  The tension began when the plaintiff assumed the duties of a trierarch (<foreign lang=\"grc\">trihrarcw=n</foreign>), a liturgy (<foreign lang=\"grc\">leitourgi/a</foreign>) (or service to the state) that was contracted out from time to time to wealthy citizens.  The trierarch was responsible for outfitting a trireme (a warship) in the Athenian fleet, ensuring that the ship was ready for service when called upon.  In performing his duties, the trierarch made use of equipment from the public stores, which had to be returned at the end of his period of service.  <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>, who had served as trierarch prior to the plaintiff, ignored the request of the plaintiff for the return of the equipment.  Upon his refusal, the plaintiff reported <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>&#8217; refusal to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council of the Five Hundred</xref> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">th=s boulh=s tw=n pentakosi/wn</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.18\">Dem. 47.18</bibl>), who gave him official permission to use whatever means available to recover the property.  When the plaintiff tried to seize other property of <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name> as security, a fist-fight erupted (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.38\">Dem. 47.38</bibl>).  As a result of this, the plaintiff brought <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name> before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> because of his non-compliance.  The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> was prepared to inflict the highest possible fine (500 drachmas, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.43\">Dem. 47.43</bibl>; see also <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>), but compromised at the last moment by assessing a fine of 25 drachmas and a promise of arbitration in the question of the fist fight.  After a long stint at sea, the plaintiff returned and called arbitrators (<foreign lang=\"grc\">diaithtw=n</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.45\">Dem. 47.45</bibl>) to settle the matter but <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name> again refused to co-operate and brought a countersuit against the plaintiff in court.  While the charges involved in <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>&#8217; countersuit are not stated, we do know that he won a judgement against the plaintiff in the amount of 1100 drachmas and forcing the plaintiff to pay the fine for not receiving enough votes (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e)pwboli/a</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.64\">Dem. 47.64</bibl>).  However, because of his duties as trierarch, the plaintiff was not immediately able to pay the judgement of 1100 drachmas and asked for more time.  Later, when the plaintiff did attempt to pay the money, he was ignored by <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>, who went that same day to the plaintiff&#8217;s farm and seized property (50 sheep and some household slaves) greatly in excess of the 1100 drachmas that he was owed (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.52-53\">Dem. 47.52-53</bibl>).  The next day, <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name> accepted the plaintiff&#8217;s money but would not return the confiscated property unless the plaintiff would drop all charges against him and his friends, <name type=\"person\">Evergus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Mnesibulus</name>.  The plaintiff refused this offer but on the very next day, after payment had already been made, <name type=\"person\">Evergus</name> returned to the plaintiff&#8217;s farm and seized additional property (some furniture) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.56\">Dem. 47.56</bibl>).  At this point, the plaintiff brought <name type=\"person\">Evergus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Mnesibulus</name>, two men who had served as witnesses on behalf of <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>, into court on charges of false testimony.  This is the subject of the present trial.  In his speech, the plaintiff charges that <name type=\"person\">Evergus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Mnesibulus</name> lied to the court about <name type=\"person\">Theophemus</name>&#8217; role in the fist-fight.  He also deplored the violence with which they had come to seize his property.  In particular, the plaintiff mentions their rough treatment of his elderly nursemaid (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.81\">Dem. 47.81</bibl>). Because the speech mentions the archonship of <name type=\"person\">Agathocles</name> (<date value=\"-356\">356 BCE</date>) (source for date:  <bibl>A.T. Murray, <title>Demosthenes II</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 303</bibl>), this speech can be said to have taken place sometime after that date.</p> <byline>Christopher Cotten</byline> </div0>    </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
