Most current community networks use wireless links for the node interconnection, applying off-the-shelf wireless equipment. While IP connectivity over the shared network infrastructure is successfully achieved, the deployment of applications in community networks is surprisingly low. To address the solution of this problem, we propose in this paper an architecture for building a cloud system that will provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service (Iaas) using resources from the community network. Our focus is also to incentivize the contribution of computing and storage as cloud resources to community networks, in order to stimulate the deployment of services and applications. Our final goal is the vision that in the long term, the users of community networks will not need to consume applications from the Internet, but find them within the wireless community network.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:publisher/><dc:date>2013-05-22</dc:date><dc:source>http://zenodo.org/record/13483</dc:source><dc:doi>10.5281/zenodo.13483</dc:doi><dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/13483</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zenodo.org:13483</dc:identifier></dc:dc>   </collection>",
