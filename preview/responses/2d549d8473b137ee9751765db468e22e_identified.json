The survey is designed, conducted and analysed by the Central Survey Unit of the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA).  It is based on a sample of the general population resident in private households and has been running since 1983.  The Survey is designed to provide a regular source of information on a wide range of social and economic issues relevant to Northern Ireland.  The CHS is an important source of information in Northern Ireland and is used by many Government departments and Agencies.  Regular clients include the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Culture Arts and Leisure, Regional Developments, Environment, Education, Employment and Learning and NISRA. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Further information about the series, including methodology, may be found on the NISRA Central Survey Unit (CSU) &lt;a href=\"http://www.csu.nisra.gov.uk/survey.asp2.htm\" title=\"CSU Surveys: CHS\"&gt;Continuous Household Survey&lt;/a&gt; web pages.&lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>For the second edition, revised data from Record 11 (Income) were added to the study.</abstract>       <abstract>&lt;B&gt;Main Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt;Topics covered include: education, employment, family information, health, children's health, mobility aids, income and benefits, housing, population, sports and physical activities.
