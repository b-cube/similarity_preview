An online survey was distributed to expatriate organisations and individual contacts and the sample was achieved through simple snowball techniques. The survey was \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlive\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd through April to November 2012, and obtained 112 responses (57 from Malaysia, 54 from Thailand, and one who did not specify where he lived). Using the survey we were able to gather interesting demographic information. We also asked about migration histories, social lives, social networks and uses of technology for maintaining social ties, personal values and goals, and relationships with other ethnic groups.  We understand this survey as contributing to the task of immersing oneself in the context \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd a key principle of ethnographic work.   The fieldwork in Malaysia and Thailand took place between July and November 2012 during which time we undertook a total of 65 recorded interviews (Malaysia: 31; Thailand: 34). We used a variety of interview methods, including face-to-face, email, skype and telephone interviewing. Most of the interviews were conducted with British lifestyle migrants in Penang, Malaysia and in Hua Hin, Thailand. The rest were conducted through digital channels with respondents in other parts of Thailand and Malaysia. These included \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdexpert\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd interviews with consular staff and migration intermediaries, such as property developers and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdexpat\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd magazine publishers. Not all interviews are archivable. Many other interviews were also undertaken within participant observation.</abstract>       <sumDscr>         <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2012-02-16T00:00:00Z\">16 February 2012</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2014-03-21T00:00:00Z\">21 March 2014</collDate>         <nation>Thailand and Malaysia</nation>         <geogCover>Hua Hin, Thailand; Penang and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</geogCover>         <geogUnit>No spatial unit</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>groups</anlyUnit>         <anlyUnit>individuals</anlyUnit>         <dataKind>Alpha-numeric</dataKind>         <dataKind>Textual</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <collMode>Online survey distributed to expatriate organisations and individual migrants who live in Asia.
