For this collection, the 1996 and 2000 merged data includes only the country of Germany. The survey, which employed standardized survey procedures and data collection instruments across all countries, focused on normative social justice concepts such as entitlement, equality of economic opportunity, and reward distribution. The study design provides analysis of normative justice at a micro level, involving respondents' evaluation of justice or rewards received by individuals and small groups, and at a macro level, through the evaluation of fairness of reward distribution at the aggregate or societal level. Variables in the dataset include demographic characteristics of the respondent, such as age, sex, marital status, education, employment, and occupation. In this survey, occupation has been classified utilizing the International Standard Classification of Occupations, and the Goldthorpe Class Categories, with the addition of the English-language version of the German \"Berufsstellungen\". Respondents were also queried about actual and desired income, what factors respondents believe determine level of pay and their fairness, dependence on pension or social welfare programs, satisfaction with the sociopolitical system, perceived and/or preferred role of the government in job allocation, and standard of living.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1996-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-06</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1997-01\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-01</timePrd>                                                   <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2000-10\" cycle=\"P2\">2000-10</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2001-02\" cycle=\"P2\">2001-02</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1996-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-06</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1997-01\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-01</collDate>                                           <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2000-10\" cycle=\"P2\">2000-10</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2001-02\" cycle=\"P2\">2001-02</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Germany</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Although in German, please see the &quot;ISJP Methodology&quot; section of the ICPSR codebook for further information in regard to universe.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    As sampling procedures vary by country and the methodological documentation for this study is in German,  please refer to methodology section of the codebook for INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT, 1991 and 1996 (ICPSR 6705) for information in regard to sampling.          </sampProc>                                      <collMode>face-to-face interview</collMode>                               <weight>               As the methodological documentation for this study is in German, please see the \"Methodological Standards\" section of the codebook for INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL JUSTICE PROJECT, 1991 and 1996 (ICPSR 6705) for information in regard to weighting.     </weight>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
