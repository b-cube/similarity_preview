These devices are often  battery-powered and in many cases do not provide user interfaces.</t>  <t>Constrained devices benefit from being interconnected using Internet protocols.  However, due to the devices\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd limitations, commonly used security protocols are not always easily applicable.  As the devices are expected to be integrated in all aspects of everyday life, the application of adequate security mechanisms is required to prevent attackers from gaining control over data or functions important to our lives.</t>  <t>This document comprises a collection of representative use cases for the application of authentication and authorization in constrained environments. These use cases aim at identifying authorization problems that arise during the lifecycle of a constrained device.  Note that this document does not aim at collecting all possible use cases.</t>  <t>We assume that the communication between the devices is based on the  Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style, i.e. a device acts as a server that offers resources such as sensor data and actuators.  The resources can be accessed by clients, sometimes without human intervention  (M2M).  In some situations the communication will happen through  intermediaries (e.g. gateways, proxies).</t>  <t>Where specific detail is necessary it is assumed that the devices communicate using CoAP <xref target=\"RFC7252\"/>, although most conclusions are generic.</t>  <section anchor=\"terminology\" title=\"Terminology\">  <t>Readers are required to be familiar with the terms defined in <xref target=\"RFC7228\"/>.  In addition, this document uses the following terminology:</t>  </section> </section> <section anchor=\"use-cases\" title=\"Use Cases\">  <t>This section lists use cases involving constrained devices with certain authorization problems to be solved.  Each use case first presents a general description of the application area, then one or more  specific use cases, and finally a summary of the authorization-related  problems users need to be solved.</t>  <t>There are various reasons for assigning a function (client or server) to a device, e.g. which device initiates the conversation, how do devices find each other, etc.  The definition of the function of a device in a certain use case is not in scope of this document.  Readers should be aware that there might be reasons for each setting and that endpoints might even have different functions at different times.</t>  <section anchor=\"container_monitoring\" title=\"Container monitoring\">  <t>The ability of sensors to communicate environmental data wirelessly opens up new application areas.  The use of such sensor systems makes it possible to continuously track and transmit specific characteristics such  as temperature, humidity and gas content during the transportation and storage of goods.</t>  <t>The proper handling of the sensors in this scenario is not easy to accomplish.  They have to be associated to the appropriate pallet of the respective container.  Moreover, the goods and the corresponding sensors belong to specific customers.</t>  <t>During the shipment to their destination the goods often pass stops where they are transloaded to other means of transportation, e.g. from ship transport to  road transport.</t>  <t>The transportation and storage of perishable goods is especially challenging since they have to be stored at a constant temperature and with proper ventilation.  Additionally, it is very important for the vendors to be informed about irregularities in the temperature and ventilation of fruits to avoid the delivery of decomposed fruits to their customers.  The need for a constant monitoring of perishable goods has led to projects such as The Intelligent Container (http://www.intelligentcontainer.com).</t>  <section anchor=\"bananas-for-munich\" title=\"Bananas for Munich\">  <t>A fruit vendor grows bananas in Costa Rica for the German market.  It instructs a transport company to deliver the goods via ship to Rotterdam where they are picked up by trucks and transported to a ripening facility.  A Munich supermarket chain buys ripened bananas from the fruit vendor and transports them from the ripening facility to the individual markets with their own company trucks.</t>  <t>The fruit vendor\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds quality management wants to assure the quality of their products and thus equips the banana boxes with sensors.  The state of the goods is monitored consistently during shipment and ripening and abnormal sensor values are recorded.  Additionally, the sensor values are used to control the climate within the cargo containers. The sensors therefore need to communicate with the climate control system.  Since a wrong sensor value leads to a wrong temperature and thus to  spoiled goods, the integrity of the sensor data must be assured.  The banana boxes within a container will in most cases belong to the same owner.  Adjacent containers might contain goods and sensors of different owners.</t>  <t>The personnel that transloads the goods must be able to locate the goods meant  for a specific customer.  However the fruit vendor does not want to disclose sensor information pertaining to the condition of the goods to other companies and therefore wants to assure the confidentiality of this data.  Thus, the  transloading personnel is only allowed to access logistic information.  Moreover, the transloading personnel is only allowed to access the data for  the time of the transloading.</t>  <t>Due to the high water content of the fruits, the propagation of radio waves is hindered, thus often inhibiting direct communication between nodes <xref target=\"Jedermann14\"/>.  Instead, messages are forwarded over multiple hops.  The sensors in the banana boxes cannot always reach the Internet during the journey.</t>  <t>In the ripening facility bananas are stored until they are ready for selling.  The banana box sensors are used to control the ventilation system and to monitor the degree of ripeness of the bananas. Ripe bananas need to be identified and sold before they spoil.</t>  <t>The supermarket chain gains ownership of the banana boxes when the bananas have ripened and are ready to leave the ripening facility.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"authorization-problems-summary\" title=\"Authorization Problems Summary\">  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>U1.1 Fruit vendors, transloading personnel and container owners want to grant different authorizations for their resources and/or endpoints to different parties.</t>   <t>U1.2 The fruit vendor requires the integrity of the sensor data that pertains the state of the goods for climate control and to ensure the quality of the monitored recordings.</t>   <t>U1.3 The container owner requires the integrity of the sensor data that is used for climate control.</t>   <t>U1.4 The fruit vendor requires the confidentiality of the sensor data that pertains the state of the goods.</t>   <t>U1.5 The fruit vendor may have several types of data that may be controlled by the same endpoint, e.g., sensor data and the data used for logistics.</t>   <t>U1.6 The fruit vendor requires the confidentiality of the data that is used to locate the goods.</t>   <t>U1.7 The fruit vendor requires the integrity of the data that is used to locate the goods.</t>   <t>U1.8 The transloading personnel requires the integrity of the data that is used to locate the goods.</t>   <t>U1.9 The container owner and the fruit vendor may not be present at the time of access and cannot manually intervene in the authorization process.</t>   <t>U1.10 The fruit vendor, container owner and transloading company want to grant temporary access permissions to a party.</t>   <t>U1.11 Messages between client and resource server might need to be forwarded over multiple hops.</t>   <t>U1.12 The constrained devices might not always be able to reach the Internet.</t> </list></t>  </section> </section> <section anchor=\"home_automation\" title=\"Home Automation\">  <t>Automation of the home has the potential to become a big future market for the  Internet of Things.  A home automation system connects devices in a house to the Internet and thus makes them accessible and manageable remotely.  Such devices might control for example heating, ventilation, lighting, home entertainment or home security.</t>  <t>Such a system needs to accommodate a number of regular users (inhabitants, close friends, cleaning personnel) as well as a heterogeneous group of  dynamically varying users (visitors, repairmen, delivery men).</t>  <t>As the users are not typically trained in security (or even computer  use), the configuration must use secure default settings, and the interface must be well adapted to novice users.</t>  <section anchor=\"controlling-the-smart-home-infrastructure\" title=\"Controlling the Smart Home Infrastructure\">  <t>Alice and her husband Bob own a flat which is equipped with home automation devices such as HVAC and shutter control, and they have a motion sensor in the corridor which controls the light bulbs there.</t>  <t>Alice and Bob can control the shutters and the temperature in each room using either wall-mounted touch panels or an internet connected device (e.g. a smartphone).  Since Alice and Bob both have a full-time job, they want to be able to change settings remotely, e.g. turn up the heating on a cold day if they will be home earlier than expected.</t>  <t>The couple does not want people in radio range of their devices, e.g. their neighbors, to be able to control them without authorization.  Moreover, they don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt want burglars to be able to deduce behavioral patterns from eavesdropping on the network.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"seamless-authorization\" title=\"Seamless Authorization\">  <t>Alice buys a new light bulb for the corridor and integrates it into the home network, i.e. makes resources known to other devices in the network.  Alice makes sure that the new light bulb and her other devices in the network get to know the authorization policies for the new device.  Bob is not at home, but Alice wants him to be able to control the new device with his devices (e.g. his smartphone) without the  need for additional administration effort.  She provides the necessary configurations for that.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"remotely-letting-in-a-visitor\" title=\"Remotely letting in a visitor\">  <t>Alice and Bob have equipped their home with automated connected door-locks and an alarm system at the door and the windows.  The couple can control this system remotely.</t>  <t>Alice and Bob have invited Alice\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds parents over for dinner, but are stuck in traffic and cannot arrive in time, while Alice\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds parents who use the subway will arrive punctually. Alice calls her parents and offers to let them in remotely, so they can make  themselves comfortable while waiting.  Then Alice sets temporary permissions that allow them to open the door, and shut down the alarm.  She wants these permissions to be only valid for the evening since she does not like it if her parents are able to enter the house as they see fit.</t>  <t>When Alice\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds parents arrive at Alice\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds and Bob\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds home, they use their smartphone to communicate with the door-lock and alarm system.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"authorization-problems-summary-1\" title=\"Authorization Problems Summary\">  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>U2.1 A home owner (Alice and Bob in the example above) wants to   spontaneously provision authorization means to visitors.</t>   <t>U2.2 A home owner wants to spontaneously change the home\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds access control    policies.</t>   <t>U2.3 A home owner wants to apply different access rights for different users.</t>   <t>U2.4 The home owners want to grant temporary access permissions to  a party.</t>   <t>U2.5 The smart home devices need to be able to communicate with   different control devices (e.g. wall-mounted touch panels,   smartphones, electronic key fobs).</t>   <t>U2.6 The home owner wants to be able to configure authorization policies remotely.</t>   <t>U2.7 Authorized Users want to be able to obtain access with little effort.</t>   <t>U2.8 The owners of the automated home want to prevent unauthorized entities   from being able to deduce behavioral profiles from devices in the home   network.</t>   <t>U2.9 Usability is particularly important in this scenario since the necessary authorization related tasks in the lifecycle of the device (commissioning, operation, maintenance and decommissioning) likely need to be performed by the home owners who in most cases have little knowledge of security.</t>   <t>U2.10 Home Owners want their devices to seamlessly (and in some cases even unnoticeably) fulfill their purpose.  The administration effort needs to be kept at a minimum.</t> </list></t>  </section> </section> <section anchor=\"eHealth\" title=\"Personal Health Monitoring\">  <t>The use of wearable health monitoring technology is expected to grow strongly, as a multitude of novel devices are developed and marketed.  The need for open industry standards to ensure interoperability between products has lead to initiatives such as Continua Alliance (continuaalliance.org) and Personal  Connected Health Alliance (pchalliance.org).  Personal health devices are  typically battery driven, and located physically on the user.  They monitor some bodily function, such as e.g. temperature, blood pressure, or pulse.  They are connected to the Internet through an intermediary base-station, using  wireless technologies.  Through this connection they report the monitored data  to some entity, which may either be the user herself, or some medical personnel in charge of the user.</t>  <t>Medical data has always been considered as very sensitive, and therefore requires good protection against unauthorized disclosure.  A frequent,  conflicting requirement is the capability for medical personnel to gain emergency access, even if no specific access rights exist.  As a result, the importance of secure audit logs increases in such scenarios. </t>  <t>Since the users are not typically trained in security (or even computer use), the configuration must use secure default settings, and the interface must be  well adapted to novice users.  Parts of the system must operate with minimal maintenance.  Especially frequent changes of battery are unacceptable.</t>  <section anchor=\"john-and-the-heart-rate-monitor\" title=\"John and the heart rate monitor\">  <t>John has a heart condition, that can result in sudden cardiac arrests.  He  therefore uses a device called HeartGuard that monitors his heart rate and his  position.  In case of a cardiac arrest it automatically sends an alarm to an  emergency service, transmitting John\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds current location.  This requires the device to be close to a wireless access point, in order to be able to get an Internet connection (e.g. John\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds smartphone).</t>  <t>The device includes some authentication mechanism, in order to prevent other persons who get physical access to it from acting as the owner and messing up the access control and security settings.</t>  <t>John can configure additional persons that get notified in an emergency, for example his daughter Jill.  Furthermore the device stores data on John\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds heart  rate, which can later be accessed by a physician to assess the condition of John\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds heart.</t>  <t>However John is a privacy conscious person, and is worried that Jill might use HeartGuard to monitor his location while there is no emergency.  Furthermore he doesn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt want his health insurance to get access to the HeartGuard data, or even to the fact that he is wearing a HeartGuard, since they might refuse to renew  his insurance if they decided he was too big a risk for them.</t>  <t>Finally John, while being comfortable with modern technology and able to  operate it reasonably well, is not trained in computer security.  He therefore needs an interface for the configuration of the HeartGuard security that is easy to understand and use.  If John does not understand the meaning of a setting, he tends to leave it alone, assuming that the manufacturer has  initialized the device to secure settings.</t>  <t>NOTE: Monitoring of some state parameter (e.g. an alarm button) and the position of a person also fits well into an elderly care service. This is particularly useful for people suffering from dementia, where the  relatives or caregivers need to be notified of the whereabouts of the person  under certain conditions.  In this case it is not the patient that decides about access.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"authorization-problems-summary-2\" title=\"Authorization Problems Summary\">  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>U3.1 The wearer of an eHealth device (John in the example above) wants to pre-configure special access rights in the context of an emergency.</t>   <t>U3.2 The wearer of an eHealth device wants to selectively allow different persons or groups access to medical data.</t>   <t>U3.3 The Security measures could affect battery lifetime of the device and changing the battery is very inconvenient.</t>   <t>U3.4 Devices are often used with default access control settings.</t>   <t>U3.5 Wearers of eHealth devices are often not trained in computer use, and especially computer security.</t>   <t>U3.6 Security mechanisms themselves could provide opportunities for denial of service attacks on the device.</t>   <t>U3.7 The device provides a service that can be fatal for the wearer if it fails.

This includes for example heating, ventilation and air condition (HVAC) as well as illumination and security systems such as fire alarms.</t>  <t>Different areas of these buildings are often exclusively leased to different companies.  However they also share some of the common areas of the building. Accordingly, a company must be able to control the light and HVAC system of  its own part of the building and must not have access to control rooms that belong to other companies.</t>  <t>Some parts of the building automation system such as entrance illumination and fire alarm systems are controlled either by all parties together or by a service company.</t>  <section anchor=\"device-lifecycle\" title=\"Device Lifecycle\">  <section anchor=\"installation-and-commissioning\" title=\"Installation and Commissioning\">  <t>A building is hired out to different companies for office space.  This building features various automated systems, such as a fire alarm system, which is  triggered by several smoke detectors which are spread out across the building. It also has automated HVAC, lighting and physical access control systems.</t>  <t>A vacant area of the building has been recently leased to company A.  Before  moving into its new office, Company A wishes to replace the lighting with a  more energy efficient and a better light quality luminaries.  They hire an  installation and commissioning company C to redo the illumination.  Company C  is instructed to integrate the new lighting devices, which may be from  multiple manufacturers, into the existing lighting infrastructure of the  building which includes presence sensors, switches, controllers etc. </t>  <t>Company C gets the necessary authorization from the service company to  interact with the existing Building and Lighting Management System (BLMS).  To prevent disturbance to other occupants of the building, Company C is provided authorization to perform the commissioning only during non-office hours and only to modify configuration on devices belonging to the domain of Company A\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds space. After installation (wiring) of the new lighting devices, the commissioner adds the devices into the company A\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lighting domain.</t>  <t>Once the devices are in the correct domain, the commissioner authorizes the interaction rules between the new lighting devices and existing devices like presence sensors.  For this, the commissioner creates the authorization rules on the BLMS which define which lights form a group and which  sensors/switches/controllers are allowed to control which groups.  These authorization rules may be context based like time of the day (office or  non-office hours) or location of the handheld lighting controller etc. </t>  </section> <section anchor=\"operational\" title=\"Operational\">  <t>Company A\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds staff move into the newly furnished office space.  Most lighting is controlled by presence sensors which control the lighting of specific group of lights based on the authorization rules in the BLMS.  Additionally employees are allowed to manually override the lighting brightness and color in their office by using the switches or handheld controllers.  Such changes are allowed only if the authorization rules exist in the BLMS.  For example lighting in the corridors may not be manually adjustable. </t>  <t>At the end of the day, lighting is dimmed down or switched off if no occupancy is detected even if manually overridden during the day.</t>  <t>On a later date company B also moves into the same building, and shares some of the common spaces with company A.  On a really hot day James who works for company A turns on the air condition in his office.  Lucy who works for company B wants to make tea using an electric kettle.  After she turned it on she goes outside to talk to a colleague until the water is boiling.  Unfortunately, her kettle has a malfunction which causes overheating and results in a smoldering fire of the kettle\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds plastic case.</t>  <t>Due to the smoke coming from the kettle the fire alarm is triggered. Alarm sirens throughout the building are switched on simultaneously (using a broadcast or multicast) to alert the staff of both companies. Additionally, the ventilation system of the whole building is closed off to prevent the smoke from spreading and to withdraw oxygen from the fire.  The smoke cannot get into James\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd office although he turned on his air condition because the fire alarm overrides the manual setting by sending commands (broadcast or multicast) to switch off all the air conditioning.</t>  <t>The fire department is notified of the fire automatically and arrives within a short time.  After inspecting the damage and extinguishing the smoldering fire a fire fighter resets the fire alarm because only the fire department is authorized to do that.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"maintenance\" title=\"Maintenance\">  <t>Company A\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds staff are annoyed that the lights switch off too often in their rooms if they work silently in front of their computer.  Company A notifies the commissioning Company C about the issue and asks them to increase the delay before lights switch off.</t>  <t>Company C again gets the necessary authorization from the service company to interact with the BLMS.  The commissioner\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds tool gets the necessary authorization from BMLS to send a configuration change to all lighting devices in Company A\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds offices to increase their delay before they switch off. </t>  </section> <section anchor=\"decommissioning\" title=\"Decommissioning\">  <t>Company A has noticed that the handheld controllers are often misplaced and hard to find when needed.  So most of the time staff use the existing wall switches for manual control.  Company A decides it would be better to  completely remove handheld controllers and asks Company C to decommission them from the lighting system.</t>  <t>Company C again gets the necessary authorization from the service company to interact with the BLMS.  The commissioner now deletes any rules that allowed handheld controllers authorization to control the lighting.  Additionally the commissioner instructs the BLMS to push these new rules to prevent cached rules at the end devices from being used. </t>  </section> </section> <section anchor=\"authorization-problems-summary-3\" title=\"Authorization Problems Summary\">  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>U4.1 The building owner and the companies want to be able to add new devices to their administrative domain (commissioning).</t>   <t>U4.2 The building owner and the companies want to be able to integrate a device that formerly belonged to a different administrative domain to their own administrative domain (handover).</t>   <t>U4.3 The building owner and the companies want to be able to remove a device from their administrative domain (decomissioning).</t>   <t>U4.4 The building owner and the companies want to be able to delegate selected administration tasks for their devices to others.</t>   <t>U4.5 The building owner and the companies want to be able to define context-based authorization rules.</t>   <t>U4.6 The building owner and the companies want to be able to revoke granted permissions and delegations.</t>   <t>U4.7 The building owner and the companies want to allow authorized entities to send data to their endpoints (default deny).</t>   <t>U4.8 The building owner and the companies want to be able to authorize a device to control several devices at the same time using a multicast protocol.</t>   <t>U4.9 The companies want to be able to interconnect their own subsystems with those from a different operational domain while keeping the control over the authorizations (e.g. granting and revoking permissions) for their endpoints and devices.</t> </list></t>  </section> </section> <section anchor=\"smart_metering\" title=\"Smart Metering\">  <t>Automated measuring of customer consumption is an established technology for electricity, water, and gas providers.  Increasingly these systems also  feature networking capability to allow for remote management.  Such systems are in use for commercial, industrial and residential customers and require a certain level of security, in order to avoid economic loss to the providers, vulnerability of the distribution system, as well as disruption of services for the customers.</t>  <t>The smart metering equipment for gas and water solutions is battery driven and communication should be used sparingly due to battery consumption.  Therefore the types of meters sleep most of the time, and only wake up every minute/hour to check for incoming instructions.  Furthermore they wake up a few times a day (based on their configuration) to upload their measured metering data.</t>  <t>Different networking topologies exist for smart metering solutions.  Based on environment, regulatory rules and expected cost, one or a mixture of these topologies may be deployed to collect the metering information.  Drive-By metering is one of the most current solutions deployed for collection of gas and water meters.</t>  <section anchor=\"drive-by-metering\" title=\"Drive-by metering\">  <t>A service operator offers smart metering infrastructures and related services  to various utility companies.  Among these is a water provider, who in turn  supplies several residential complexes in a city.  The smart meters are installed in the end customer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds homes to measure water consumption and thus generate billing data for the utility company.  The meters do so by sending  data to a base station.  Several base stations are installed around the city  to collect the metering data.  However in the denser urban areas, the base stations would have to be installed very close to the meters.  This would require a high number of base stations and expose this more expensive equipment to manipulation or sabotage.  The service operator has therefore chosen another approach, which is to drive around with a mobile base-station and let the meters connect to that in regular intervals in order to gather metering data.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"meshed-topology\" title=\"Meshed Topology\">  <t>In another deployment, the water meters are installed in a building that already has power meters installed, the latter are mains powered, and are therefore not subject to the same power saving restrictions.  The water meters can therefore use the power meters as proxies, in order to achieve better connectivity.  This requires the security measures on the water meters to work through intermediaries.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"advanced-metering-infrastructure\" title=\"Advanced Metering Infrastructure\">  <t>A utility company is updating its old utility distribution network with  advanced meters and new communication systems, known as an Advanced Metering  Infrastructure (AMI).  AMI refers to a system that measures, collects and analyzes usage, and interacts with metering devices such as electricity meters, gas meters, heat meters, and water meters, through various communication media either on request (on-demand) or on pre-defined schedules.  Based on this technology, new services make it possible for consumers to control their utility consumption and reduce costs by supporting new tariff models from utility companies, and more accurate and timely billing.</t>  <t>The technical solution is based on levels of data aggregation between smart meters located at the consumer premises and the Meter Data Management (MDM)  system located at the utility company.  Two possible intermediate levels are:</t>  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>Head-End System (HES) which is hardware and software that receives the  stream of meter data and exposes an interface to the MDM.</t>   <t>Data Collection (DC) units located in a local network communicating with a number of smart meters and with a backhaul interface communicating with the HES, e.g. using cellular communication.</t> </list></t>  <t>For reasons of efficiency and cost end-to-end connectivity is not always  feasible, so metering data is stored in batches in DC for some time before  being forwarded to the HES, and in turn accessed by the MDM.  The HES and the DC units may be operated by a third party service operator on behalf of the utility company.  One responsibility of the service operator is to make sure that meter readings are performed and delivered to the HES.  An example of a Service Level Agreement between the service operator and the utility company is e.g.  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdat least 95 % of the meters have readings recorded during the last 72 hours\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"authorization-problems-summary-4\" title=\"Authorization Problems Summary\">  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>U5.1  Devices are installed in hostile environments where they are physically   accessible by attackers.

Sensors and actuators with various functionalities can be integrated into fitness equipment, games and even clothes.  Users can carry their devices around with them at all times.</t>  <t>Usability is especially important in this area since users will often want to spontaneously interconnect their devices with others. Therefore the configuration of access permissions must be simple and fast and not require much effort at the time of access (preferably none at all).</t>  <t>The required level of security will in most cases be low since security breaches will likely have less severe consequences.  The continuous monitoring of data might however enable an attacker to create behavioral or movement profiles.  Moreover, the aggregation of data can seriously increase the impact on the privacy of the users.</t>  <section anchor=\"dynamically-connecting-smart-sports-equipment\" title=\"Dynamically Connecting Smart Sports Equipment\">  <t>Jody is a an enthusiastic runner.  To keep track of her training progress, she has smart running shoes that measure the pressure at various points beneath her feet to count her steps, detect irregularities in her stride and help her to improve her posture and running style.  On a sunny afternoon, she goes to the Finnbahn track near her home to work out.  She meets her friend Lynn who shows her the smart fitness watch she bought a few days ago.  The watch can measure the wearer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds pulse, show speed and distance, and keep track of the configured training program.

Example processes include manufacturing, power generation, and refining of raw  materials.</t>  <t>Since the advent of the Stuxnet worm it has become obvious to the general  public how vulnerable this kind of systems are, especially when connected to the Internet.  The severity of these vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that many ICS are used to control critical public infrastructure, such as power, water treatment of traffic control.  Nevertheless the economical  advantages of connecting such systems to the Internet can be significant if appropriate security measures are put in place.</t>  <section anchor=\"oil-platform-control\" title=\"Oil Platform Control\">  <t>An oil platform uses an industrial control system to monitor data and control equipment.  The purpose of this system is to gather and process data from a  large number of sensors, and control actuators such as valves and switches to steer the oil extraction process on the platform.  Raw data, alarms, reports  and other information are also available to the operators, who can intervene with manual commands.  Many of the sensors are connected to the controlling units by direct wire, but the operator is slowly replacing these units by  wireless ones, since this makes maintenance easier.</t>  <t>The controlling units are connected to the Internet, to allow for remote  administration, since it is expensive and inconvenient to fly in a technician  to the platform.</t>  <t>The main interest of the operator is to ensure the integrity of control messages and sensor readings.

The appeal of these devices is that they are small and inexpensive.  That makes it easy to integrate them into many aspects of everyday life.  Therefore, the devices will be entrusted with vast amounts of valuable data or even control functions, that need to be protected from unauthorized access. Moreover, the aggregation of data must be considered: attackers might  not only collect data from a single device but from many devices, thus  increasing the potential damage.</t>  <t>Not only the data on the constrained devices themselves is threatened,  the devices might also be abused as an intrusion point to infiltrate  a network.  Once an attacker gained control over the device, it can be used to attack other devices as well.  Due to their limited capabilities, constrained devices appear as the weakest link in the network and hence pose an attractive target for attackers.</t>  <t>This section summarizes the security problems highlighted by the use cases  above and provides guidelines for the design of protocols for authentication and authorization in constrained RESTful environments.</t>  <section anchor=\"attacks\" title=\"Attacks\">  <t>This document lists security problems that users of constrained devices want to solve.  Further analysis of attack scenarios is not in scope of the document.  However, there are attacks that must be considered by solution developers.</t>  <t>Because of the expected large number of devices and their ubiquity, constrained devices increase the danger from Pervasive Monitoring <xref target=\"RFC7258\"/> attacks.</t>  <t>As some of the use cases indicate, constrained devices may be installed in hostile environments where they are physically accessible (see <xref target=\"smart_metering\"/>).  Protection from physical attacks is not in the scope of ACE, but should be kept in mind by developers of authorization solutions.</t>  <t>Denial of service (DoS) attacks threaten the availability of services a device provides.  E.g., an attacker can induce a device to perform steps of a heavy weight security protocol (e.g. Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) <xref target=\"RFC6347\"/>) before authentication and authorization can be verified, thus exhausting the device\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds system resources.  This leads to a temporary or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd e.g. if the batteries are drained \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd permanent failure of the service.  For some services of constrained devices, availability is especially important (see <xref target=\"eHealth\"/>).  Because of their limitations, constrained devices are especially vulnerable to denial of service attacks.  Solution designers must be particularly careful to consider these limitations in every part of the protocol.  This includes:</t>  <t><list style=\"symbols\">   <t>Battery usage</t>   <t>Number of message exchanges required by security measures</t>   <t>Size of data that is transmitted (e.g. authentication and access control data)</t>   <t>Size of code required to run the protocol</t>   <t>Size of RAM memory and stack required to run the protocol</t> </list></t>  <t>Another category of attacks that needs to be considered by solution developers is session interception and hijacking.</t>  <t><!-- * Interoperability (U1.1, U2.5, U4.6) --></t>  <t><!--  Rationale: Resource Owners may interact with Clients from various -->   <!--  manufacturers and vice-versa.

To make matters worse the sensor data may be recorded continuously thus  allowing to gather significant information about an individual subject through the sensor readings.  Therefore privacy protection is especially important,  and Authentication and Access control are important tools for this, since they make it possible to control who gets access to private data.</t>  <t>Privacy protection can also be weighted in when evaluating the need for  end-to-end confidentiality, since otherwise intermediary nodes will learn the content of potentially sensitive messages sent between endpoints and thereby threaten the privacy of the individual that may be subject  of this data.</t>  <t>In some cases, even the possession of a certain type of device can be confidential, e.g. individuals might not want to others to know that they are wearing a certain medical device (see <xref target=\"eHealth\"/>). </t>  <t>The personal health monitoring use case (see <xref target=\"eHealth\"/>) indicates the need for secure audit  logs which impose specific requirements on a solution.  Auditing is not in the scope of ACE.  However, if an authorization solution provides means for audit logs, it must consider the impact of logged data for the privacy of all parties involved.  Suitable measures for protecting and purging the logs must be taken during operation, maintenance and decommissioning of the device.</t>  </section> <section anchor=\"acknowledgments\" title=\"Acknowledgments\">  <t>The authors would like to thank Olaf Bergmann, Sumit Singhal, John Mattson, Mohit Sethi, Carsten Bormann, Martin Murillo, Corinna Schmitt, Hannes Tschofenig, Erik Wahlstroem, and Andreas Backman for reviewing and/or  contributing to the document.
