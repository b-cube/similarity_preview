Lidar data will serve multiple purposes, but have primarily been collected to (1) evaluate active faulting, slope instability, thaw settlement, erosion, and other engineering constraints along proposed pipeline routes, and (2) provide a base layer for the state-federal GIS database that will be used to evaluate permit applications and construction plans. The dataset represents ground-classified laser returns from the lidar survey and their associated geospatial coordinates.</abstract> <purpose>Provide high-resolution terrain elevation and land cover elevation data.</purpose> <supplinf> This metadata file was written to document and describe, as a whole, all points classified as ground points generated for this project. For each data delivery area, reports documenting data collection methodology, accuracy, and quality control were provided by Watershed Sciences and the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI). These reports have been combined into single comprehensive reports organized by delivery region. The lidar QC report (the comprehensive report from DOGAMI) and the lidar delivery report (the comprehensive report from Watershed Sciences) can be found at http://www.dggs.alaska.gov/pubs/id/22722. Information about the quadrangles included in individual delivery regions can be found in the lidar delivery index report included with the data download. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to also include several elements that are required to facilitate internal data management. These elements relate individual data items to a common dataset. This dataset describes a single layer titled: &gt;ground_points: ground-classified laser returns from the lidar survey and their associated geospatial coordinates. </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>2010</begdate> <enddate>2011</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-150</westbc> <eastbc>-147</eastbc> <northbc>71</northbc> <southbc>70</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys</themekt> <themekey>Alaska Pipeline</themekey> <themekey>Gasline</themekey> <themekey>Geomorphology</themekey> <themekey>Lidar</themekey> <themekey>Proposed Natural Gas Pipeline</themekey> <themekey>Remote Sensing</themekey> <themekey>Point Cloud Data</themekey> <themekey>Lidar LAS File Format</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys</placekt> <placekey>Beechey Point Quadrangle</placekey> <placekey>Alaska Highway Corridor</placekey> <placekey>Alaska, State of</placekey> <placekey>Trans-Alaska Pipeline</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>The dataset(s) is (are) available directly from the State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys (see contact information below).</accconst> <useconst>Any hard copies or published datasets utilizing these datasets shall clearly indicate their source.

The contractor used a surveying system to measure GCP&apos;s. GPS survey techniques allow surveyors to collect many precisely located GCP&apos;s which can be used as a control comparison with lidar elevations. A licensed surveyor is often able to post process GPS survey data to accuracies less than 1 cm both horizontally and vertically. Lidar 1 m grids were loaded into ArcGIS software for visual analysis. Data were examined through slope and hillshade models of bare earth returns. Both bare earth and highest hit models were examined for calibration offsets, tiling artifacts, seam line offsets, pits and birds. Please see the lidar delivery report and the lidar QC report for specific information about laser point processing and accuracy evaluation.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>Lidar returns have been examined to ensure that data from overlapping flight lines have consistent elevation values. Project specifications require that lidar consistency, measured as vertical offsets of data between adjacent flight lines, must average less than 0.15 meters. Flight lines have been examined to ensure that there was at least 60% sidelap and that there are no data gaps. All file naming conventions and formats have been checked for consistency. Refer to the lidar QC report and the lidar delivery report for statistics from consistency analyses of individual delivery sets.</logic> <complete>All data have been loaded and viewed to ensure completeness.

Horizontal accuracy is measured as the divergence between points from overlapping flight lines. Accuracy is affected by system attitude offsets, scale and GPS/IMU drift. Manual system calibration and automated attitude calibration techniques were used to resolve divergence of data. Please see the lidar QC report and lidar delivery report for specific information about accuracy of lidar data.</horizpar> </horizpa> <vertacc> <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy refers to the elevation difference between measured GPS control data and lidar bare-earth digital elevation models.

The survey used the Leica ALS60 system. Near-nadir scan angles were used to increase penetration of vegetation to ground surfaces. Ground-level GPS and aircraft IMU were collected during the flight.</procdesc> <procdate>2010 and 2011</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Processing lidar data: (1) Flight lines and data were reviewed to ensure complete coverage of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. (2) Laser point-return coordinates were computed using ALS Post Processor software, IPAS Pro GPS/INS software, and Waypoint GPS, based on independent data from the lidar system, IMU, and aircraft. (3) The raw lidar file was assembled into flight lines per return with each point having an associated x, y, and z coordinate. (4) Visual inspection of swath-to-swath laser point consistencies in the study area were used to perform manual refinements of system alignment. (5) Custom algorithms were designed to evaluate points between adjacent flight lines. Automated system alignment was computed based on randomly selected swath-to-swath accuracy measurements that consider elevation, slope, and intensities. Specifically, refinement in the combination of system pitch, roll, and yaw-offset parameters optimize internal consistency. (6) Noise (e.g., pits and birds) was filtered using ALS post-processing software, based on known elevation ranges, and included the removal of any cycle slips.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011, 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Lidar data points were classified through automated point processing algorithms and manual inspection.
