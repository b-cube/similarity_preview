The file is georeferenced to earth&apos;s surface using geographic projection and decimal degree coordinate system.  The specifications for the horizontal control of Q3 Flood Data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:24000.  The user is encouraged to refer to the &apos;Q3 FLOOD DATA SPECIFICATIONS&apos; manual &lt;URL:fema-spec.doc&gt; and the &apos;Q3 FLOOD DATA USERS GUIDE&apos; &lt;URL:fema-userg.doc&gt; for complete information on the technical details of the Q3 data, its attributes, its uses, and limitations. </abstract> <purpose> The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act which &quot;... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards&quot; (Section 2 (b) (4) of the 1973 Flood Disaster Protection Act).  In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas, the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.  Q3 Flood Data files are intended to convey certain key features from the existing hard copy FIRM to provide users with automated flood risk data.  Edge-matching errors, overlaps and deficiencies in coverage, and similar problems are not corrected during digitizing or post-processing.  These data may be used to locate Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).  More detailed information may be obtained from the paper FIRM. </purpose> <supplinf> This metadata document acts as a global metadata document for 37 individual parish &apos;Q3 Flood Zone&apos; datasets.  Not all Louisiana parishes have a Q3 Flood Zone dataset.  The geographic bounds given in this document represents the geographic bounds of the entire state, rather the geographic bounds of any particular parish data set.  The following list gives the list of parishes with Q3 data and the name of the corresponding shapefile.  &gt;Parish name            Shapefile name &gt;-----------            -------------- &gt;Acadia                 acadia &gt;Allen                  allen &gt;Ascension              ascension &gt;Assumption             assumption &gt;Avoyelles              avoyelles &gt;Bossier                bossier &gt;Calcasieu              calcasieu &gt;Cameron                cameron &gt;Catahoula              catahoula &gt;Concordia              concordia &gt;East Baton Rouge       ebatonrouge &gt;Franklin               franklin &gt;Grant                  grant &gt;Iberia                 iberia &gt;Iberville              iberville &gt;Jefferson              jefferson &gt;Lafayette              lafayette &gt;Lafourche              laFourche &gt;Livingston             livingston &gt;Madison                madison &gt;Natchitoches           natchitoches &gt;Orleans                orleans &gt;Ouachita               ouachita &gt;Plaquemines            plaquemines &gt;Pointe Coupee          pointecoupee &gt;Rapides                rapides &gt;St. Bernard            stbernard &gt;St. Charles            StCharles &gt;St. James              StJames &gt;St. John the Baptist   StJohnBaptist &gt;St. Landry             StLandry &gt;St. Martin             stmartin &gt;St. Mary               StMary &gt;St. Tammany            StTammany &gt;Tangipahoa             tangipahoa &gt;Terrebonne             terrebonne &gt;Vermilion              vermilion </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1999</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current> Date the most current Q3 data were projected to geographic coordinates, NAD83 for release on the &apos;Louisiana GIS CD: A Digital Map of the State.&apos; </current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-93.929665</westbc> <eastbc>-92.614677</eastbc> <northbc>30.052691</northbc> <southbc>29.575413</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>none</themekt> <themekey>FEMA Flood Hazard Zones</themekey> <themekey>Q3 Flood Data</themekey> <themekey>Q3 Coverage</themekey> <themekey>Special Flood Hazard Areas</themekey> <themekey>Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps</themekey> <themekey>Land use cover</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>none</placekt> <placekey>Louisiana</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>none</accconst> <useconst>none</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator&apos;s Office</cntorg> <cntper>David Gisclair</cntper> </cntorgp> <cntpos>Technical Assistance Program (TAP) Director</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype> <address>Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator&apos;s Office</address> <address>Office of the Governor</address> <address>150 Third Street, Suite 405</address> <city>Baton Rouge</city> <state>LA</state> <postal>70801</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(225) 219-5800</cntvoice> <cntfax>(225) 219-5802</cntfax> <cntemail>&lt;URL:mailto:david.gisclair@la.gov&gt;</cntemail> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <browse> <browsen>&lt;URL: floodzones_cameron_FEMA_1999.gif&gt;</browsen> <browset>GIF</browset> </browse> <datacred> LOSCO gratefully acknowledges FEMA for providing the source data for production of this data set and LSU (Louisiana State University) for projecting these data to NAD83 coordinates.

Certain node-area-line relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements.  Some of these requirements include: lines must begin and end at nodes, lines must connect to each other at nodes, lines do not extend through nodes, left and right areas are defined for each line segment and are consistent throughout the files, and the lines representing the limits of the file neatlines are free of gaps. Tests of logical consistency were performed by ARC/INFO software modules. Check plots were made to test for leaks in all internal polygons. </logic> <complete> Data completeness for Q3 Flood Data files reflect the content of the source graphic.  Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints.  Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP, for use in insurance rating, and for floodplain management.  Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analysis of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall;  information obtained through consultation with the communities:  floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis.  Both detailed and approximate analyses are employed.  Generally, detailed analysis are used to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of communities.  For undeveloped areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data.  Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are studied.  The Q3 Flood Data coverages may be derived from DFIRM-DLGs, from FIRM- DLGs, from FIRMs digitized previously for emergency applications, or may be newly created files.  In Q3 Flood Data derived from older data sets, certain items may not have been captured or may have been captured differently from the current Q3 Flood Data specifications.  In some cases, preliminary FIRM data have been included in the Q3 Flood Data files.  These data have been provided to the community for their review and comment and may be subject to change before their final publication date.  In addition, in some cases areas designated as Flood Prone Areas on maps prepared by USGS and FIA have been included in the Q3 Flood Data files.  These areas were delineated based on available information on past floods and are described by a unique attribute code that distinguishes them from areas of 1% annual chance of flooding derived from FIRMs.  Flood Insurance Rate Maps continually undergo revisions and updates.  Some of these revisions are effected by letter (Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)).  Q3 Flood Data may not reflect the most current information or information that is not mappable at the publication scale of FIRM.

Horizontal control of Q3 Flood Data was established using USGS quadrangle maps at 1:24000 or other standard scales.  Users should assess the horizontal positional sources and the requirements of their application.  With increased frequency, large-scale spatial data sets are becoming widely available for computer-based geographic information systems.  Q3 Flood Data may be used in combination with other digital spatial data, however, users should be aware that scalar enlargements do not enhance the relative accuracy of the Q3 Flood Data (i.e. 1:24000). </horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Federal Emergency Management Agency</origin> <pubdate>199?</pubdate> <title>Q3 Flood Data, [Louisiana Parish Name]</title> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>computer file</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>199?</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr> Date of publication of each individual Q3 data set, or more appropriately, the range of publication dates of the sources FIRMs that went into each Q3 dataset.
