The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to         support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are increase         stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure         commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food         security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery         that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho         imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA         farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of         communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology         and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and         government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result         of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed         County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery         have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These         changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands.         In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing         conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year update of base ortho         imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter         quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to         the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain         as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.</abstract>       <purpose>NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying         season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support         of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter GSD product         provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1         meter and 1/2 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in         cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that use the imagery for a         variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment. The NAIP is         also used for disaster response.</purpose>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>2012</begdate>           <enddate>2014</enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>Ground Condition</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>Irregular</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-180.0</westbc>         <eastbc>-56.0</eastbc>         <northbc>72.0</northbc>         <southbc>-17.0</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt>         <themekey>farming</themekey>         <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>None</themekt>         <themekey>Digital Ortho rectified Image</themekey>         <themekey>Ortho Rectification</themekey>         <themekey>Quarter Quadrangle</themekey>         <themekey>NAIP</themekey>         <themekey>JPEG 2000</themekey>         <themekey>Aerial Compliance</themekey>         <themekey>Compliance</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt>         <placekey>United States</placekey>         <placekey>U.S.</placekey>         <placekey>US</placekey>       </place>       <place>         <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special           sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing           Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and           Technology</placekt>         <placekey>United States</placekey>         <placekey>U.S.</placekey>         <placekey>US</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>There are no limitations for access.</accconst>     <useconst>None.

From 2003 to 2004 the specifications were as follows: 1-meter GSD imagery was to match           within 3-meters. For 2005 the 1-meter GSD specification was changed to 5 meters matching           the reference imagery. In 2006 a pilot project was completed using true ground           specifications rather than reference imagery. All states used the same specifications as           2005 except Utah, which required a match of +/- 6 meters to true ground. In 2007 all           specifications were the same as 2006 except Arizona used true ground specifications and           all other states used reference imagery. In 2008 and subsequent years all specifications           were the same as 2007 except approximately half of the states acquired used true ground           specifications and the other half used reference imagery. The 2008 states that used           absolute ground control where; Indiana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Texas,           Vermont, and Virginia. From 2009 to present all NAIP imagery acquisitions used the +/- 6           meters to ground specification.</horizpar>       </horizpa>     </posacc>     <lineage>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>USDA-FSA-APFO Aerial Photography Field Office</origin>             <pubdate>20141203</pubdate>             <title>CLYDE, NE</title>             <geoform>remote-sensing image</geoform>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <typesrc>UnKnown</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <sngdate>               <caldate>20140516</caldate>             </sngdate>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>Aerial Photography Date for aerial photo source.</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>orthorectifed Image</srccitea>         <srccontr>Digital orthorectifed Image.</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Flight planning was performed in Leica MissionPro over a buffered boundary           covering DOQQ extents provided by the USDA. A 500m reduced resolution DEM file was used to           determine ground heights. A targeted flight altitude of approximately 18,000 feet above           ground level with sidelap of 27% was used for flight planning parameters. Five Cessna           Conquests and one Piper Cheyenne aircraft were used for acquisition, all equipped with           Leica ADS100 systems where utilized for data capture. The Leica ADS100 pushbroom sensor           has been calibrated by the manufacturer as well as validated against a local calibration           range. The calibration includes measuring the radiometric and geometric properties of the           camera. These data are used in the Post Processing Software to eliminate the radiometric           and geometric distortion. All aerial imagery was collected with associated GPS/IMU data.           ADS collection requires high quality IMU data for processing and was critical for early           access hosting of digital data to the web for USDA interim access and review. After early           access web delivery was complete, all imagery was triangulated using Leica XPro in which           the airborne GPS data was constrained to expected limits. The final adjustments assure a           high quality relative adjustment and a high quality absolute adjustment limited to the           airborne GPS data accuracy. This process assures the final absolute accuracy of all           geopositioned imagery. Both signalized and photo identified ground control were used to QC           and control the IMU/GPS based aerial triangulation bundle block solution. For each project           area the latest NED was downloaded from the USGS National Map Seamless Server website in           late Spring 2014. Thirty Meter NED was used in all cases, and preferred over the available           ten meter spacing to minimize image smearing and distortions that are exacerbated by a           finer, but not more accurate DEM. A visual inspection of the NED using color cycled           classification by elevation and a shaded relief was performed to check for gaps,           corruption and gross errors. When available the NED was compared to known higher quality           elevation sources to detect flaws. The predicted horizontal error for each point was added           as an attribute in the SURDEX enterprise database. An operator reviews ortho seams in           areas these predicted errors indicate horizontal error in excess of the contract           specifications. Any imagery errors introduced by source NED required patching from an           alternate perspective or strip of photography. Processing hardware used included various           brands of survey grade GPS receivers, various brands and models of computers, RAID6           storage, calibrated monitors, various brands of monitor calibration colorimeters. Leica           XPro was used for post processing of ADS pushbroom data, triangulation and           orthorectification. SURDEX software was used to color correct and remove bidirectional           reflectance, vignetting and other illumination trends. USDA APFO Image Metrics are           measured and images corrected to conform to the Image Metrics using SURDEX software.           GPS/IMU data was reduced to projected coordinates in the appropriate UTM zone using the           IGI office software. Aerial Triangulation and orthorectification was performed using Leica           MissionPro. SURDEX software was used to adjust for minor radiometric variation between           adjacent images. SURDEX software was used to calculate the optimal seam path, check seam           topology and create master tiles. SURDEX ortho software generates occlusion/smear polygons           used during seam review of steep terrain. SURDEX software was used to visually inspect           master tiles for seam and image defects. SURDEX software was used to project and cut final           DOQQ image files from masters. SURDEX software was used to create CCM metadata. Lizardtech           GeoExpress version 8.0.0.3065 was used to create the CCM image file. SURDEX software was           used to perform final formatting, QC and naming of the DOQQ. USGS metadata parser software           was used to validate the metadata. Various versions of Microsoft Windows were used in all           phases of production. Surdex Grouping Tool provides real-time updates of the USDA APFO           Image Metrics. The image technician adjusts image correction parameters to bring the           radiometric characteristics of large groups of images within the Image Metrics ranges.           Grouping Tool was used again after DOQQ and CCM production to provide a quality assurance           check. Individual DOQQ and CCM may not meet the USDA APFO Image Metrics ranges due to land           cover. The goal is to have the state as a whole meet the Image Metrics. To validate the           accuracy of the block adjustment derived from GPS/IMU, sensor parameters and conjugate           point measurements, photo identifiable ground control points were field surveyed within           each State. These points were surveyed using GPS techniques to produce coordinates that           are accurate to +/- 0.25 meters RMSE in XYZ. The GPS surveying techniques utilized assured           that the coordinates are derived in the required project datum and relative to an approved           National Reference System. If the block does not fit the control points within           specifications the pass and tie points were reviewed for blunders and weak areas. If,           after these corrections were made, the block still does not fit the control well the GPS           and IMU processing were reviewed. Once the block has proper statistics and fits the           control to specifications, the final bundle adjustment was made. As AT points are           frequently on man-made and other vertical features not included in the DEM, these ortho           points can only be used to indicate regions of error by the clusters of points that           predict excessive horizontal displacement. All products are reviewed by independent           personnel prior to delivery. The delivery is checked for omissions, commissions, naming,           formatting, specification compliance and data integrity</procdesc>         <procdate>20141203</procdate>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Following the receipt of the NAIP uncompressed geotiff quarter quadrangles (QQs)           at APFO via a contract vehicle. Each NAD83 NAIP QQ image is transformed into the Web           Mercator Auxiliary Sphere (WMAS) projection. This transformation was accomplished using           ESRI ArcGIS 10.1 Arctools with the datum recalculation algorithm \"NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_5\"           and Nearest neighbor resampling method. Then each NAIP image is clipped with a 2 pixel           margin on all four edges using a DOQQ vector frame.
