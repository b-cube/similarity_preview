Modern land surface models require a characterisation of the land surface hydrological regime and this parameter allows the use of the TOPMODEL hydrological model to achieve this .This Geographic Information System layer is intended for use as topographic ancillary files for the TOPMODEL routing model option within the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. The topographic index variable here is directly comparable to the compound topographic index available from United States Geological Survey's Hydro1K at 30 sec resolution.

The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  A move to organic farming can have significant effects on wildlife, soil and water quality, as well as changing the ways in which food is supplied, the economics of farm business and indeed the attitudes of farmers themselves. Two key questions were addressed in the SCALE project: what causes organic farms to be arranged in clusters at local, regional and national scales, rather than be spread more evenly throughout the landscape; and how do the ecological, hydrological, socio-economic and cultural impacts of organic farming vary due to neighbourhood effects at a variety of scales.  The research was undertaken in 2006-2007 in two study sites: one in the English Midlands, and one in southern England. Both are sites in which organic farming has a `strong? local presence, which we defined as 10 per cent or more organically managed land within a 10 km radius. Potential organic farms were identified through membership lists of organic farmers provided by two certification bodies (the Soil Association and the Organic Farmers and Growers). Most who were currently farming (i.e. their listing was not out of date) agreed to participate. Conventional farms were identified through telephone listings.   Respondents? farms ranged in size from 40 to 3000 acres, with the majority farming between 100 and 1000 acres. Most were mixed crop-livestock farmers, with dairy most common in the southern site, and beef and/or sheep mixed with arable in the Midlands. In total, 48 farms were studied, of which 21 were organic farmers. No respondent had converted from organic to conventional production, whereas 17 had converted from conventional to organic farming. Twelve of the conventional farmers defined themselves as practicing low input agriculture.   Farmer interview data from this study are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6761 (see online resources).

The Climoor field site is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increase temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots(July to September annually). We have measured a range of key community characteristics and processes (ranging from plant diversity to rates of soil respiration) since the experiment began in 1998. In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain). Detailed descriptions of the site (including both vegetation and soil) and treatments are included in the supporting information as well as the methods used, and it is vital that this is considered when re-using this data. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Coordinate reference systems</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Elevation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Climate change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heathland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drought</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>warming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calluna</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vaccinium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Empetrum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>automated roof technology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>shrubland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Clocaenog Forest</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ruthin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NE Wales.</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere-vegetation-soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biweekly to annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03637 Task 11</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03012NEU Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02613 Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03425 Task 9</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02639 Task 2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01735NEW</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-26T14:42:39Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6372b558-ba64-4fbe-8766-019e01535b37\">     <title>Web Map Service for model estimates of topsoil properties [Countryside Survey] </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6372b558-ba64-4fbe-8766-019e01535b37</link>     <description>This web map service (WMS) depicts estimates of mean values within selected habitats and parent material characteristics across GB were made using CS data using a mixed model approach.

Gravimetric moisture content (%) data is representative of 0 - 15 cm soil depth  Carbon data is representative of 0-15 cm soil depth and includes Loss-on-ignition (%), Carbon concentration (g kg-1) and Carbon density (t ha-1).   Loss-on-ignition was determined by combustion of 10g dry soil at 375 deg C for 16 hours; carbon concentration was estimated by multiplying LOI by a factor of 0.55, and carbon density was estimated by combining carbon concentration with bulk density estimates.  Nutrient data is representative of 0 - 15 cm soil depth and includes total nitrogen (N) concentration (%), C:N ratio and Olsen-Phosphorus (mg/kg).  pH and bulk density (g cm-3) data is representative of 0 - 15 cm soil depth. Topsoil pH was measured using 10g of field moist soil with 25ml de-ionised water giving a ratio of soil to water of 1:2.5 by weight; bulk density was estimated by making detailed weight measurements throughout the soil processing procedure.   Areas, such as urban and littoral rock, are not sampled by CS and therefore have no associated data. Also, in some circumstances sample sizes for particular habitat/parent material combinations were insufficient to estimate mean values. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Broad Habitat</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Carbon</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Loss on ignition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Organic matter</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Parent Material Model</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil mositure</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>microbial diversity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Shannon index</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Simpson index</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>C:N ratio</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nitrogen</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Phosphorus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soils Olsen-Phosphorus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Carbon:Nitrogen ratio</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Olsen P</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Olsen-P</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pH</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bulk density</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Abundance</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Acari</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Collembola</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Microarthropods</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Organic matter</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Taxa richness</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bacterial community structure</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NMDS</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-07-09T08:59:16Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/16649ff0-af24-41b0-bcb4-15e610dac170\">     <title>Operational taxonomic units for epilithon bacteria in the rivers  Wolf and Tamar catchments </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/16649ff0-af24-41b0-bcb4-15e610dac170</link>     <description>This dataset contains  operational taxonomic units for epilithon (water samples): Approximate location of sampling sites was determined from maps to provide good spatial coverage of the Wold River through to the Tamar River.

Three stones were taken from each of the 20 locations and epilithon removed from a defined area. Samples were kept in the cold and removed to the laboratory for analyses. DNA was extracted from all soil and epilithon samples using the MOBIO Powersoil 96 well DNA extraction kit. DNA was quality checked for purity and yield prior to submission for 454 pyrosequencing to assess both bacterial and eukaryotic biodiversity within each sample. Following bioinformatic sequence processing, sequencing were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTU) and the data tables display the percentage of each OTU within each sample.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jonathan Newman</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>microbiology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>genetic information</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-05-14T10:55:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/de35d4ea-e75e-464c-b82f-2c2c1402cf8e\">     <title>Location and identification of soil sample sites from the Wolf and Tamar catchment </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/de35d4ea-e75e-464c-b82f-2c2c1402cf8e</link>     <description>This dataset contains the codes for water laboratory analysis, sampling dates and locations for soil samples collected from the Tamar catchment in winter 2013/2014 as part of the South West project.
