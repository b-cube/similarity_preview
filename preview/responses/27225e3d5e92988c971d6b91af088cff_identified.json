For the raster datasets AMGP_HSI, BBPL_HSI, DUNL_HSI, LBDO_HSI, PESA_HSI, REPH_HSI, RNPH_HSI, and SESA_HSI raster values represent the habitat suitability index at a given location for the species in the dataset title (i.e., American Golden-Plover [AMGP], Black-bellied Plover [BBPL], Dunlin [DUNL], Long-billed Dowitcher [LBDO], Pectoral Sandpiper [PESA], Red Phalarope [REPH], Red-necked Phalarope [RNPH], or Semipalmated Sandpiper [SESA]).  Habitat suitability indices range from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to areas with habitat variables identical to a species mean and 0 correspond to highly dissimilar areas.  In the raster dataset Species_richness_meanHSI raster values represent mean habitat suitability indices for all 8 species of modeled shorebird at a given location.  Again, mean habitat suitability indices range from 0 to 1, where 1 corresponds to areas with habitat variables identical to all species mean and 0 correspond to highly dissimilar areas.  In the raster dataset species_richness_predicted_number_species raster values represent the number of species in which the habitat suitability index exceeded the selected threshold value at a given location.  Selected threshold values were 0.31 for Black-bellied Plover, 0.56 for American Golden-Plover, 0.06 for Semipalmated Sandpiper, 0.13 for Pectoral Sandpiper, 0.05 for Dunlin, 0.05 for Long-billed Dowitcher, 0.62 for Red-necked Phalarope, and 0.05 for Red Phalarope. Dataset Limitations: This dataset was developed from 767 plots surveyed as part of the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM), as well as landscape environmental variables. Therefore, limitations in any of these datasets would influence the accuracy of habitat suitability indices contained within this dataset. Additionally, as surveys were conducted in a rapid fashion and PRISM protocols were being developed over the course of this study with methods for plot selection varying among years (see metadata for North_Slope_PRISM_Surveys), comparability of shorebird abundances and presence/absence may have been questionable. Therefore, we used a presence-only modeling technique when developing habitat suitability indices. As such, habitat suitability indices presented in this dataset represent the potential of an area to support a species. Therefore, when interpreting these data, the user should be aware that although an area may be suitable for a species, actual presence is a function of many variables, including annual variability in habitat conditions, species population demographics, species range and migratory pathways, or other habitat features not measured in this study.

This process maximized the number of calibration plots predicted as occupied while minimized the proportion of the landscape predicted as suitable (Browning et al. 2005).  Similar to Griffin et al. (2010), we restrained threshold values so that at least 80% of the calibration dataset was accurately classified (this only influenced the American Golden-Plover threshold value).  Finally, we assessed the accuracy of predictive maps by determining the proportion of validation plots accurately classified based on threshold values. Accuracy of predicted suitability for the validation dataset was relatively high for all species, ranging from 0.65-0.98 (Black-bellied Plover = 0.74 [17% increase over chance], American Golden-Plover = 0.65 [20% increase over chance], Semipalmated Sandpiper = 0.98 [56% increase over chance], Pectoral Sandpiper = 0.96 [55% increase over chance], Dunlin = 0.87 [27% increase over chance], Long-billed Dowitcher = 0.91 [50% increase over chance], Red-necked Phalarope = 0.85 [30% increase over chance], and Red Phalarope = 0.88 [31% increase over chance]).   Similar to previous studies (Browning et al. 2005, Griffin et al. 2010), we evaluated the uncertainty in the model selection procedure (i.e., confidence in the selection of the best performing model given a different random sample of the data), as well as the importance of environmental variables to species specific habitat suitability indices, using 1,000 bootstrap samples that were obtained by randomly sampling with replacement both the calibration and validation datasets.  Here, the sample size of each bootstrap sample equaled the sample size of the calibration dataset.  For each bootstrap sample, we calculated and evaluated partitioned Mahalanobis distances for the same model set, where best performing models were selected by maximizing the median HSI value for the partition and the model.  The proportion of times a given model was selected as the best performing model was recorded and used to evaluate the uncertainty in the model selection procedure and the importance of environmental variables.  Additionally, bootstrap samples were used to evaluate the uncertainty in selecting a given partition (k) for the best performing model.  For each bootstrap sample, the proportion of times a given partition was selected given the best performing model was recorded for each species. Despite relatively high accuracy for habitat suitability models for all species, certainty in model selection procedure was lower and variable among species, with bootstrap selection frequencies for the best performing model ranging from 0.04-0.68.  However, individual variables within the best performing model for each species had relatively high bootstrap selection frequencies.  These results indicate high certainty that specific variables should be included in the best performing model; however, low certainty in the combination of variables found in the best performing model.  For example, for all species, percent upland tussock tundra, percent upland shrubby tussock tundra, and percent upland scrub were always present in the best performing model for all bootstrapped samples, indicating the importance of these variables to habitat suitability for the eight species of shorebirds in this region.  Similarly, for Black-bellied Plover, Semipalmated Sandpiper, Pectoral Sandpiper, Dunlin, Red-necked Phalarope, and Red Phalarope, elevation was selected in the best performing model &gt; 70% of the time.  Selection of a specific partition, given the best performing model, had relatively high certainty with bootstrap selection frequencies &gt; 80% for most species (Black-bellied Plover = 0.88, American Golden-Plover = 0.30, Semipalmated Sandpiper = 1.00, Pectoral Sandpiper = 1.00, Dunlin = 0.97, Long-billed Dowitcher = 0.43, Red-necked Phalarope = 1.00 and Red Phalarope = 0.90). </attraccr> </attracc> <logic>QA/QC completed by Originator.</logic> <complete>This dataset only depicts predicted habitat suitability or species richness within the study area.
