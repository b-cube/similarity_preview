We share an intellectual conviction that organising is a highly complex historical phenomenon and that management is best understood in an inter-disciplinary context, drawing from the disciplines of sociology, politics, philosophy and economics as well as from developments in critical psychology, cultural geography, cultural studies and organisational theory.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p class=\"quicklinks\">Find out more about fees and funding for <a title=\"Fees and Funding\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management/postgraduate/taught/fees\" class=\"internal-link\">taught</a> and <a title=\"Fees and Funding\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management/postgraduate/research/fees\" class=\"internal-link\">research </a>degrees</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>bc45</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>mba uk</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>distance learning postgraduate courses</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>post graduate course UK</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2011-02-22T07:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
