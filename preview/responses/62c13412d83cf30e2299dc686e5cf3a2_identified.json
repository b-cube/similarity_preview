POLITICAL ACTION II consists of   two parts: a second panel wave of reinterviews with respondents from   the first Political Action surveys and a new cross-section sample.   Topics covered include respondent's level of satisfaction with material   standard of living, interest in politics, perception of privileged and   under-privileged groups, opinions on various social and political   issues, and ranking of important political goals. Additional variables   address the performance of the present government, good and bad aspects   of major left and major right parties, legitimacy of the present   government and the political system in general, approval of protest   behavior, participation in conventional and unconventional activities,   voting behavior, attitudes toward young people, and political trust   items. Background information provided for respondents includes age,   sex, ethnic origin, education, religion, marital status, number of   children, employment status, occupation, union membership, personal and   family income, organizational memberships and activities, and father's  and mother's education and political preferences.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1979\" cycle=\"P1\">1979</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1981\" cycle=\"P1\">1981</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1979\" cycle=\"P1\">1979</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1981\" cycle=\"P1\">1981</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Germany</geogCover>             <geogCover>Netherlands</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Respondents to Political Action I (1973-1976), and persons   aged 16 years and older from three nations: Germany, the Netherlands,  and the United States.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    National multistage probability samples.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 Data were made available through the Zentralarchiv fuer   empirische Sozialforschung, Universitaet zu Koeln, from whom a printed  codebook (ZA-No. 1188) may be obtained.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR09581.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
