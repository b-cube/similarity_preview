Each climate division record includes a weekly averaged atmospheric temperature, precipitation, soil moisture in the upper and lower layers, percentage of flood capacity, potential evaporation, runoff, crop moisture and change from previous week, monthly moisture anomaly, preliminary or final Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), and precipitation needed to end drought value. The CPC preliminary data are collected in near real-time from ground stations throughout the U.S., and are displayed in tabular form. The preliminary values are replaced by quality controlled data from the National Climatic Data Center with an approximate time lag of 3 to 6 months.</abstract> <purpose>The climate division based weekly PDSI and CMI data are produced in support of CPC drought monitoring and prediction activities, including but not limited to the U.S. Drought Blends, the U.S. Drought Monitor, the U.S. Drought Outlook, and the Weekly Weather and Crop Bulletin.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19730301</begdate> <enddate>Present</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Weekly</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-125.00</westbc> <eastbc>-66.00</eastbc> <northbc>50.00</northbc> <southbc>24.00</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>NASA GCMD Science Keywords</themekt> <themekey>Climate Indicators &gt; Drought/Precipitation Indices &gt; Palmer Drought Crop Moisture Index</themekey> <themekey>Atmosphere &gt; Atmospheric Phenomena &gt; Drought</themekey> <themekey>Climate Indicators &gt; Drought/Precipitation Indices &gt; Crop Moisture Index</themekey> <themekey>Climate Indicators &gt; Drought/Precipitation Indices &gt; Palmer Drought Severity Index</themekey> <themekey>Climate Indicators &gt; Drought/Precipitation Indices &gt; PDSI</themekey> <themekey>Climate Indicators &gt; Drought/Precipitation Indices &gt; Crop Moisture Index</themekey> <themekey>Atmosphere &gt; Atmospheric Temperature &gt; Air Temperature</themekey> <themekey>Atmosphere &gt; Atmospheric Temperature &gt; Surface Air Temperature</themekey> <themekey>Atmosphere &gt; Precipitation &gt; Precipitation Amount</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>precipitation</themekey> <themekey>temperature</themekey> <themekey>drought</themekey> <themekey>Crop Moisture Index</themekey> <themekey>Palmer Drought Severity Index</themekey> <themekey>Z Index</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>NASA GCMD Location Keywords</placekt> <placekey>Continent &gt; North America &gt; United States of America</placekey> </place> <stratum> <stratkt>NASA GCMD Location Keywords</stratkt> <stratkey>Vertical Location &gt; Land Surface</stratkey> </stratum> </keywords> <thelayid> <numthlay>2</numthlay> <layrname> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>limatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere</themekey> </theme> </layrname> <layrname> <theme> <themekt>NASA GCMD Science Keywords</themekt> <themekey>Climate Indicators &gt; Drought/Precipitation Indices &gt; Palmer Drought Crop Moisture Index</themekey> </theme> </layrname> </thelayid> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>Acknowledgment of the Data Originator when using the data item as a source.</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Climate Prediction Center, NOAA</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntpos>Meteorologist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>5200 Auth Road</address> <city>Camp Springs</city> <state>Maryland</state> <postal>20746</postal> <country>United States of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(301) 763-8000</cntvoice> <cntemail>adam.allgood@noaa.gov</cntemail> <hours>08:00 - 5:00 PM Eastern</hours> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <browse> <browsen>http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/regional_monitoring/palmer.gif</browsen> <browsed>Weekly Palmer Drought Severity Index by Climate Divisions</browsed> <browset>GIF</browset> </browse> <datacred>This dataset was originally developed by Paul Sabol and was later maintained and updated by Tom Heddinghaus and Mark Armstrong.

These data are then plugged into the legacy Fortran 77 Palmer codes, which generate the weekly summaries. Approximately 3-6 months later, NCDC sends CPC weekly temperature and precipitation data, which are input into the Palmer process. The values are then rerun to the present using the new NCDC values and remaining CPC preliminary data. See ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/htdocs/temp2/palmcode.f for an example copy of the Palmer code.</procdesc> <procdate>2011</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Climate Prediction Center</cntorg> <cntper>Adam Allgood</cntper> </cntorgp> <cntpos>Meteorologist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>physical</addrtype> <address>5200 Auth road</address> <city>Camp Springs</city> <state>MD</state> <postal>20746</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(301)763-8000</cntvoice> <cnttdd>(301)763-8000</cnttdd> <cntfax>(301)763-8395</cntfax> <cntemail>Adam.Allgood@noaa.gov</cntemail> <hours>9 AM to 4 PM</hours> <cntinst>Call the office</cntinst> </cntinfo> </proccont> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres>0.5</latres> <longres>0.5</longres> <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit> </geograph> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>These data are produced using weekly temperature and precipitation data as the source. Temperature and precipitation data are obtained daily from a network of stations reporting to CPC&#146;s Climate Assessment Database (CADB), as well as gridded data available at CPC on a 0.5 degree gridded resolution. CPC archives historical PDSI/CMI data by week, using a legacy process. These data can be found here: ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/htdocs/temp2 The ASCII data files are titled palmerYY, where YY is the last two digits of the year. The 1973-1985 data are stored in a single file. Rows (lines) in the file contain data for a single week for a single climate division. Columns (not space delimited, but defined based on column order and width &#150; an unfortunate holdover from FORTRAN days) contain the various fields produced by the Palmer process. The column definitions can be found via comments in the FORTRAN code (e.g., format5.f) supplied as an example for how to read the data into a FORTRAN program. As an example, the first row (line) of the palmer09 data (ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/htdocs/temp2/palmer09) is: 1012009 1 0.21 44.1  6.00  0.00 -3.97  0.11  0.11  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.11  0.100.99951.00000.65090.0032 0.837  0.11  0.00  0.90  0.00  1.00 -0.79 -0.66  1.00  5.00 -3.15 49.  0.06 -0.84  1.60  1.09  0.00  0.40 -0.70  0.00  1.09  0.00  1.00 -0.89 The leading &#147; 1012009&#148; value is the state/climate division (state &#147; 1&#148; = Alabama, climate division &#147;01&#148; = Northern Valley, forming the 101) followed by the year (&#147;2009&#148;).  The next value, &#147;1&#148;, is the week number. Note that the first week of the Palmer &#147;year&#148; is the week containing the first Wednesday in March, NOT the first week in January. In this case, week 1 of 2009 would be March 1 &#150; 7, 2009. All weeks end Saturdays. The next column, containing 0.21, is the precipitation total for Alabama&#146;s Northern Valley during March 1-7, 2009 (in inches). The next column (44.1) is the weekly average temperature (degrees Fahrenheit), and so on. CMI is the fourth value from the end of each data line. In this example, it would be 1.09. A table of the 344 U.S. climate divisions used in these data can be found here: ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/htdocs/temp2/clidiv A map of the U.S. Climate divisions can be found here: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/us-climate-divisions.php A few additional notes about quirks in these data: 1.) Since the Palmer &#147;year&#148; begins in March, and each file contains 52 or 53 weeks of data, then the end of each file actually contains the first two months&#146; worth of data (Jan and Feb) for the following year. 2.) The &#147;year&#148; column is set via a settings file in manual reruns of this data (when CPC preliminary data are replaced by NCDC quality controlled numbers).  Therefore, the year value may not be correct near the end of each file.  In other words, it&#146;s better to determine the year based on the filename and week number, not the year column within the data. 3.) These data are produced in near real-time, and are then replaced with NCDC quality controlled values several months later. 4.) Near real-time data using CPC preliminary temperature and precipitation values can be found here: ftp://ftp.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/htdocs/temp4/current.data  - This file is updated weekly on Monday afternoons.  Reruns due to data issues are sometimes necessary, so take note if the weekly temperature/precipitation values are exactly equal to the previous week&#146;s (an indication that preliminary data were not available at run time, requiring a rerun). Data issues should be brought to my attention if encountered.</eaover> <eadetcit>NOAA's Climate Prediction Center</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>NOAA's Climate Prediction Center</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntpos>Meteorologist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>5200 Auth Road</address> <city>Camp Springs</city> <state>Maryland</state> <postal>20746</postal> <country>United States of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(301) 763-8000</cntvoice> <cntemail>adam.allgood@noaa.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </distrib> <distliab>The user assumes the entire risk related to its use of this data.
