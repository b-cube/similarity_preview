OK, I will change it.    The only sane way to keep them identical would be removing the \"restrict\" keywords from the .c files. It wouldn't be a big loss but it would be a bit silly.   liblzma is implemented in C99 but keeping the API headers compatible with C89 and C++98 allows using the library from those languages too.  I might be wrong, but doesn't it work to mix runtimes if one doesn't expose runtime-specific stuff via the DLL API? For example, liblzma API doesn't have any C-library-dependent declarations and it doesn't, for example, expose file descriptor numbers or throw exceptions. I have understood that this way it's fine to use MinGW-w64-built liblzma.dll with other toolchains. Most of time time it doesn't work with static libraries though, which is why people have been wishing that liblzma could be built with Visual Studio so that they could create a static executable that includes liblzma. For non-static uses the existing binaries should be O&lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Lasse Collin</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-02-03T18:44:17</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/220\">     <title>Re: Fairly Complete MSVC 2013 Solution/Project</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/220</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt; I see the point of that rule. On the other hand, I think it can get boring to copypaste #include &amp;lt;config.h&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;stdbool.h&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;assert.h&amp;gt; and such in every file (or perhaps I'm too lazy).  Making XZ Utils strictly follow the rule would need quite a big patch. For example, various portability issues are taken care in src/common/sysdefs.h. Those could be moved to &amp;lt;config.h&amp;gt; and one could create replacement &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;inttypes.h&amp;gt;, and other headers (like gnulib can do) that are used when the system headers aren't good enough. So it wouldn't be only about modifying the .c and .h files but also about adding the replacement file logic to the build system.  Some clean up could certainly be done. For example in the xz command line tool, perhaps some includes could be omitted from src/xz/private.h and only added to files that need them. I think I still like to keep the includes for the internal xz headers (src/xz/*.h) in private.h. The whole point of private.h is that it's the very first file that is includ&lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Lasse Collin</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-30T22:04:37</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/219\">     <title>Re: Fairly Complete MSVC 2013 Solution/Project</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/219</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;Hi Lasse,  A general note, the CMake implementation is a work in progress. It was tested with vs2013, nmake and ninja generators. It is very basic and at the very least lacks: * tests * testing on mingw/linux/osx * packaging. * gettext * doc generation.  There many warnings detected by VS which I'm not sure how to fix.   Also, Please see inline:  [GabiD] - I'll try my best to remedy this now that there is interest :)  [GabiD] - Yes - I'll fix that.  [GabiD] - It's a left over from some experiments in static analysis. I'll remove this.  [GabiD] - They silence a few warnings.  [GabiD] - They generate warnings. It's best to keep the definition and deceleration of a function identical.  I'll revert this is an interface change and there are other places where it's not fixed. On a side note, It's unclear to me why the interfaces are to be in C89 since the implementation requires it (mixing C runtimes in windows will caused failures).  [GabiD] - John Reiser answered this in length.  [GabiD] If it's that important I&lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Gabi Davar</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-30T15:17:47</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/218\">     <title>Re: Fairly Complete MSVC 2013 Solution/Project</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/218</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;   [[snip]]   Please do not rely on transitive #include.  Retain the \"#include &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;\" in mytime.c as long as anything in mytime.c relies on anything in &amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;, namely GetTickCount64().  The rule should be, \"If code in a file uses a symbol (name of function, variable, macro, typedef, struct, etc.) then the file must provide the appropriate declaration within the file itself, or via a specific #include which contains such a declaration directly.\"  Abiding by that rule makes it easier to read, understand, and maintain the code because each search for declaration will succeed with a #include depth of at most 1.  The rule makes the code more robust, because changes to the intermediate #includes (such as removing the transitive #include) cannot result in surprises.  Surprises are particularly likely with older compilers, where the omission of a function prototype might not be detected by default. Instead, the compiler silently uses the default prototype int func(...); which cannot detect type errors in&lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>John Reiser</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-28T20:50:04</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/217\">     <title>Re: Fairly Complete MSVC 2013 Solution/Project</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/217</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt; Yes, I'm interested. This will need some work though. The changes need some explanation. Right now there is a single big commit with no information why something has been done.  A few thoughts:    - The .gitignore has wrong dir name (2012 vs. 2013).    - Adding __declspec(noreturn) breaks other compilers. How important     this change even is? Whatever optimizations it allows aren't     important in the places those functions get called. If it is to     silence a compiler warning, it can be considered but it's still not     that important.    - Are the casts added in tuklib_integer.h there to silence warnings?     If so, I'll add the casts.    - I don't want \"restrict\" keywords in the API headers. The headers     need to be C89 and C++98 compatible. There is nothing wrong having     the restricts only in the .c files. Maybe they were added to     silence warnings? The restricts aren't that important so maybe they     could even be removed, but I think the best is to leave those as is     unless MSVC cannot &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Lasse Collin</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-28T19:03:50</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/216\">     <title>Fairly Complete MSVC 2013 Solution/Project</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/216</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;Hi,  I've created vs2013 based solution for lzma DLL, lzma static and most utils.

I fixed the link.   This list is fine for user questions too.   xz isn't an archiver, that is, it cannot pack multiple files into a single file. tar is an archiver but it isn't a compressor. To archive and compress, you can use tar and xz together:      tar cf - /etc | xz &amp;gt; etc.tar.xz  GNU tar and BSD tar can call xz themselves:      tar caf etc.tar.xz /etc  Maybe you have used .zip or .7z files. With such file formats the archiving, compression, and possibly also encryption are done by a single file format and tool. When using tar with gzip/bzip2/xz/whatever the tasks are done by separate file formats and tools.  &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Lasse Collin</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2014-11-11T12:43:47</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/208\">     <title>How to compress a folder with xz ?</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.compression.xz.devel/208</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;Hi, all,  The forum webpage give an error.

It works on systems that support unaligned memory access. The relevant code is in src/liblzma/common/memcmplen.h:      http://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git;a=blob;f=src/liblzma/common/memcmplen.h  Different architectures get the best performance with different code. The code should be decent for x86-64 and maybe also for 32-bit x86 (at least the SSE2 version). Those may still have some room left for improvement and help is welcome to improve them. However, no one has looked at how the code could be improved for non-x86 archs, so I'm especially interested in finding people to help with that.  I have heard that the generic versions work on little endian 32-bit ARM and 32-bit big endian PowerPC. On those the generic code is slightly faster than the byte-by-byte buffer comparison, but perhaps arch-specific code could do better.
