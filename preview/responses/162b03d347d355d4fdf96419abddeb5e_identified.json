It is a sign of the King\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Christian Faith and the importance of the Word of God\\ufffd\\ufffdfor Christians of all generations.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIt is a great honour to be part of the ceremony itself and to hold something of such huge significance.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>At the time that King Richard III was on the throne, no Bible had been printed in England, so England's early Bibles were all printed on the continent. This example was printed by Johannes Amerbach, a Swiss humanist and art collector, at his printing house in Basel. It was printed in 1481, and was a reprint of his 1479 edition, which had sold out.</p> <p>Amerbach's books were remarkable for their textual accuracy, and also for their use of roman type instead of the usual Gothic type; this feature makes his Bible easy to read if one understands Latin.</p> <p>Immediately after the ceremony, the Bible will be returned to the University Library by Dr Simon Dixon, Manager of the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Special Collections.</p> <p>He said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdm delighted that a Bible from Special Collections will play such a significant role in the Service of Compline. In bequeathing his outstanding collection of rare books to University College, Leicester in 1929, it was the intention of Caleb Robjohns that they would serve the public good. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that one of his Bibles should be used for the ceremony.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The volume was bequeathed to University College, Leicester in 1929 by Caleb Robjohns, a Leicester hosiery manufacturer and bibliophile, whose collection included over 500 rare Bibles.</p> <p align=\"center\"><strong>Ends</strong></p> <p><b>Notes to editors:</b></p> <p>Dr Stephen Foster is available from 20 March\\ufffd\\ufffdon <a href=\"mailto:saf30@leicester.ac.uk\">saf30@leicester.ac.uk</a></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-20T00:03:36Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/the-power-of-volunteering\">     <title>The Power of Volunteering</title>     <link>http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/the-power-of-volunteering</link>     <description>University of Leicester student volunteers impact on the local community</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Issued by the University of Leicester on 19 March 2015</strong></p> <p>More than 150 University of Leicester student volunteers have made a powerful impact in the local community after enriching the learning experiences of around 2000 school children.</p> <p>Through a range of rewarding long term, short term and one-off school based opportunities organised by the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Career Development Service, student volunteers were given the chance to share their knowledge, expertise and enthusiasm for learning with children across the county.</p> <p>Activities included creating and delivering creative writing workshops and school assemblies, storytelling, providing GCSE Maths support and facilitating after school clubs. These activities provided students with an opportunity to flex their creative muscles and draw upon strengths to support children from the ages of 5 to 16.</p> <p>As well as helping to directly benefit the learning experiences of children across Leicestershire, the opportunities enabled student volunteers to enhance their employability skills, gain confidence and test out a potential career route.</p> <p>Chani Sandhu, Volunteering Project Co-ordinator at the Career Development Service, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe volunteers have made an incredible impact in the local community, engaging with around 2000 school children. We\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdve had some fantastic feedback from the schools, thanking us and the student volunteers for the wonderful job they have done. Volunteering is not only a great way to benefit the local community, but also acts as an excellent way of developing skills and confidence.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>During the Chinese New Year in February 2015, 30 international volunteers planned and delivered assemblies based on different aspects of the Chinese culture in five different schools.</p> <p>Karen Stuart, Assistant Head Teacher at St Thomas Moore School, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThank you for sending the volunteers to teach our children about the Chinese culture. The children really enjoyed the presentation.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Anna Boychuk, Head Teacher at Whitehall Primary School, added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI just wanted to say a big thank you for the assembly and can you please congratulate the students for their excellent assembly \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the students did really well.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>During World Book Day 2015, nine student volunteers participated in a reading challenge at Parkland Primary School with children in 12 classes. One of the student volunteers, Lucy Brownson, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI personally really enjoyed it, and found that the kids seemed to as well. This was a great opportunity to develop my interpersonal and leadership skills, as the work required me to get out of my comfort zone and really interact with the kids, while keeping them on task and making sure that they engaged with the reading itself.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Jo Andrews from Parkland Primary School was impressed with the student volunteers on the day \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd she said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThey were all fantastic and showed a really professional attitude. They engaged with the children really well and questioned them too. We would love to welcome them back to read with children anytime.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The Career Development Service actively supports students in finding different types of volunteering opportunities within a range of sectors. Many opportunities are advertised on MyCareers \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds online portal for supporting the career development needs of all its students.</p> <p>Schools and organisations interested in recruiting talented and enthusiastic student volunteers can contact the Career Development Service on <a href=\"mailto:volunteering@le.ac.uk\">volunteering@le.ac.uk</a><b>\\ufffd\\ufffd</b></p> <p align=\"center\"><b>ENDS</b></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-19T13:14:42Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/university-of-leicester-king-richard-iii-media-operational-note\">     <title>University of Leicester: King Richard III media operational note</title>     <link>http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/university-of-leicester-king-richard-iii-media-operational-note</link>     <description>Media opportunities from the University that discovered and identified the mortal remains of King Richard III</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><b>Issued by University of Leicester Press Office on 19 March 2015</b></p> <p><b> </b></p> <ul> <li>Press pack for the University of Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Dig, Discovery and Identification of Richard III: <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/for-journalists/richard-iii\">http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/for-journalists/richard-iii</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li> Accreditation for all media events is being provided by Leicester Cathedral at St Martin's House. </li> </ul> <ul> </ul> <table class=\"data\"> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"378\"> <p><b>Saturday   21st March, 10am-4pm </b></p> <p><b> </b></p> <p><b>Venue:   University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester LE1 7RH</b></p> <p><b>Parking   for media will be available in the University Sports Centre car park accessed   via Entrance 1 on University Road.

The platform will facilitate collaboration between the three projects, helping them to deliver results faster.</p> <p>Looking to the future, the projects are keen to collaborate with other Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease research projects worldwide. The announcement comes during a symposium held at the 12th International Conference on Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases and Related Neurological Disorders (AD/PD 2015), and in the wake of a major World Health Organization (WHO) conference on dementia.</p> <p>Anthony Brookes, Professor of Bioinformatics and Genomics in the world-renowned Department of Genetics at the University of Leicester, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdUnifying the world's dementia research means appropriately and effectively connecting and synergising the data from these projects. The University of Leicester operates in the large EMIF and EPAD projects to help innovate and deliver the necessary data management solutions, in particular emphasising joint data sharing and data discovery approaches that can release the value of integrated data while respecting the requirements and ambitions of researchers and patients alike.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Professor Brookes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds team at Leicester have for many years run the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds largest open access <a href=\"http://www.gwascentral.org/\">\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGWAS Central\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</a> database, which provides a centralised compilation of summary level findings from all published Genome Wide Association Studies, thereby mapping common human genetic variations to risks of various diseases and other traits.</p> <p>More recently he has expanded this area of work, and thereby contributed to the high-profile <a href=\"http://genomicsandhealth.org/our-work/initiatives/beacon-project\">Beacon</a> project in the <a href=\"http://genomicsandhealth.org/\">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)</a>, by devising the federated <a href=\"http://www.cafevariome.org/\">Cafe Variome</a> system that feeds possible and probable disease causing mutations into a search engine for a global \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdInternet of DNA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that will link millions of genomes together.</p> <p>Dementia already affects over 35 million people globally, and as populations age, this figure is set to rise to over 115 million by 2050. The disease places a huge and growing burden on health and social care systems and on the families and carers of those affected. Yet despite decades of research, there is still neither treatment nor cure for the disease.</p> <p>The challenge of developing new, effective treatments for dementia is simply too great for any organisation to tackle alone, and so IMI has launched a number of projects that bring together leading experts from the pharmaceutical industry, universities, small biotechs, and patient organisations from across Europe and beyond. The three projects in the new IMI Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Disease Research Platform have a combined budget of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd138 million and address complementary areas of Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease research.</p> <p>AETIONOMY is paving the way towards a new approach to the classification of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds and Parkinson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds diseases, thereby improving drug development and increasing patients\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd chances of receiving a treatment that works for them.</p> <p>EMIF is developing a common information framework of patient-level data that will link up and facilitate access to diverse medical and research data sources, opening up new avenues of research, particularly in the fields of Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease and obesity.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>EPAD is pioneering a new, more flexible approach to clinical trials of innovative Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease treatments designed for people who have the disease but have not yet developed dementia.</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Ends</b></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-19T09:23:11Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/government-commits-ps60-million-of-funding-to-midlands-universities\">     <title>Government commits \\ufffd\\ufffd60 million of funding to midlands universities </title>     <link>http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/march/government-commits-ps60-million-of-funding-to-midlands-universities</link>     <description>University to receive funding for research initiatives </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><b>Issued by the University of Leicester Press Office on 18 March 2015 </b></p> <ul> <li><b>Funding will see a step change in energy research in critical areas such as thermal energy and energy storage.</b></li> <li><b>Partnership between six leading UK Universities -</b> <strong>the Universities of Birmingham, Nottingham, Warwick, Loughborough, Aston and Leicester</strong> -<b> and the British Geological Survey (BGS).</b></li> </ul> <p>The Government has today confirmed \\ufffd\\ufffd60 million for a new energy research project in the Midlands.

We wanted to support research carried out locally. After seeing first hand the impact that Hope Against Cancer is making by funding the clinical trails unit at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, we believe the charity is a positive platform for change.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>In addition to raising money for such a worthy cause, the students hope to raise awareness of the importance of exercise as a means of preventing cancer. Scientific research has demonstrated that maintaining a healthy lifestyle and weight reduces the risk of developing many forms of cancer. This entails eating a balanced diet to provide our bodies with all the nutrients they need, but just as importantly includes keeping active, which could help to prevent around 3,400 cases of cancer every year in the UK alone.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Karen added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEveryone in the class knows someone who has been affected by cancer - that\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds strong motivation to do something about it. We decided to do something healthy, as lifestyle changes can be the first step in the prevention of some cancers.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>To support the charity you can donate on the Virgin Money Giving site:</p> <p><a href=\"http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/changegearfortheallclear\">http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/changegearfortheallclear</a></p> <p>or Text HFCR08 \\ufffd\\ufffd3 to 70070.</p> <p>Find out more by visiting: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/changegearfortheallclear\">www.facebook.com/changegearfortheallclear</a>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>For further information about Hope Against Cancer contact Corinne Green on 0116 270 0101.</p> <p align=\"center\"><b>Ends</b></p> <p><b>Notes to editors:</b></p> <p><b>About Hope Against Cancer:</b></p> <p>Hope Against Cancer was set up in 2003 to increase the funds available for cancer research in Leicestershire and Rutland and make clinical trials more available to local people.\\ufffd\\ufffd Surveys demonstrate that when patients with cancer are treated at cancer centres and units carrying out research, outcomes are significantly improved.</p> <p>Around 5,000 people in Leicestershire are diagnosed with cancer each year and the region currently has hot spots of cancer associated with cultural and socio-economic factors and healthcare inequalities.</p> <p>Since 2003, Hope has raised over \\ufffd\\ufffd4m and funded over 40 research projects tackling many different forms of cancer.\\ufffd\\ufffd In 2012 the charity established and opened a dedicated clinical trials unit - a partnership between the University of Leicester and Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Hospitals - at Leicester Royal Infirmary to offer patients access to new medicines and therapies, funding a dedicated HOPE Nurse to add to the care and support trials patients receive.\\ufffd\\ufffd Hope has also been instrumental in the city of Leicester becoming a cancer research centre of excellence.\\ufffd\\ufffd This will prioritise leading potential practice changes in early detection, prevention and treatment of cancers while continuing to identify research projects with a clear benefit for patients across the region.</p> <p>Hope Against Cancer works closely with the Universities of Leicester, Loughborough and De Montfort and is grateful for their support.

Instead, confused thinking over security (caused by a global ambition for UK security, on the one hand, combined with a shrinking military capacity and a series of recently unsuccessful military deployments, on the other) has led to remote warfare becoming a desirable tactic, enabling the UK to involve itself in conflicts that are \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddoable\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd rather than ones that fit with an overall strategy. The report \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which evaluates how remote warfare is carried out by the British in Sierra Leone (1990s), Afghanistan (2001-2002 and 2009), Libya (2011), and Mali (2012) \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd reveals a number of worrying consequences of remote warfare, including:</p> <ul> <li>Blowback: Undermining regimes and destabilising countries leading to dangerous long-term solutions (e.g. Afghanistan, Pakistan)</li> <li>Spreading or prolonging conflicts: This may be counter-productive and more harming to civilians to externally sustain a conflict that would otherwise see defeat for one side or exhaustion on both sides and a peace agreement (e.g. Libya, Syria)</li> <li>Danger of a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdforever war\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd scenario whereby warfare is pursued on an ongoing basis with no end, involving the militarization of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeveryday spaces\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (e.g. war on terror)</li> </ul> <p>The report finds that remote warfare is employed as a tactic rather than as a strategy by the UK, with a focus on short-term goals rather than any long-term thinking and concludes that it will only have the chance of being effective when part of a coherent defence policy and even then carries serious risks.</p> <p><b>Dr Jon Moran, author of the report says: </b></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRemote Warfare may be a useful tool or set of tools for applying military force in the modern world but if used without strategic thinking it may end up being ineffective and even irresponsible.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p><b>Caroline Donnellan, Manager of the Remote Control Project</b> <b>says:</b></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis report highlights the benefits that are likely to accrue from having a carefully thought out long-term strategy that is aimed at finding solutions to the many difficult and protracted conflicts that persist.

If few are found, the entropy is high and the system is harder to predict.</p> <p class=\" \">Professor Heiko Balzter from the Centre for Landscape and Climate Research at the University of Leicester and lead author of the study explained: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdI had the idea to apply a new method to the climate data. It has been applied a lot to diagnose heart disease, because it is good at detecting regularity and randomness in time-series data. We are literally taking the pulse of the planet.</p> <p class=\" \">\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdImagine you roll a dice and write down the series of numbers it lands on. You expect these to be random. Say you roll a 1, 6, and 5. If the system has low entropy then we would expect other chunks of rolling 1 followed by 6 to have a higher probability of being followed by a 5. We have applied just that same method to European temperature data.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p class=\" \">The study shows that some scientific data analysis methods overlook subtle changes in the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdregularity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of the temperature data.</p> <p class=\" \">The unique way of analysing the data involves an analysis at several temporal scales. The data are aggregated to scales of months and analysed at each scale separately to find the time-scales at which the regularity of the data changes.</p> <p class=\" \">The researchers analysed the Central European variance-adjusted mean monthly air temperature anomalies (CRUTEM4v) produced at the University of East Anglia.</p> <p class=\" \">The results show that the temporal scales of the current temperatures (1961-2014) are different from the long-term average (1850-1960). At temporal scales longer than 12 months the researchers found a marked loss of regularity in the data for the past 54 years.</p> <p class=\" \">\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdInterestingly, the changes we found only operated on time-scales longer than about a year. On these time-scales the climate seems to have become less predictable,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd says Professor Balzter.</p> <p class=\" \">The study reveals that from 1961 to 2014, at time-scales from 12 to 70 months the air temperatures in Europe show less regularity compared to 1851-1960.</p> <p class=\" \">This may be a sign that the regional temperatures are now influenced by more complex forces at work \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and the researchers suggest that it could be possible that climate system feedbacks express themselves in altered temporal scales of European temperatures.</p> <p class=\" \">The study also provides a map visualisation of the entropy results for the first time, showing the time scales which have changed most.</p> <p class=\" \">The study, entitled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMulti-scale entropy analysis as a method for time-series analysis of climate data\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, is published in the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute journal <i>Climate</i>.
