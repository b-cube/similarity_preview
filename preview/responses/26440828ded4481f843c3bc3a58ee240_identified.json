The information encoded about these features includes classification and other characteristics,             delineation, geographic name, position and related measures, a \"reach code\" through which other information can be related to             the NHD, and the direction of water flow. The network of reach codes delineating water and transported material flow allows             users to trace movement in upstream and downstream directions. In addition to this geographic information, the dataset contains             metadata that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data. The NHD is available nationwide in two             seamless datasets, one based on 1:24,000-scale maps and referred to as high resolution NHD, and the other based on             1:100,000-scale maps and referred to as medium resolution NHD. Additional selected areas in the United States are available             based on larger scales, such as 1:5,000-scale or greater, and referred to as local resolution NHD. The NHD from The National Map             supports many applications, such as making maps, geocoding observations, flow modeling, data maintenance, and stewardship. For             additional information on the NHD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/index.html.                           The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion             dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The             drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed             of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Wisconsin River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into             smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about             30,000 acres. The WBD is made up of polygons nested into six levels of data respectively defined by Regions, Subregions, Basins,             Subbasins, Watersheds, and Subwatersheds. For additional information on the WBD, go to http://nhd.usgs.gov/wbd.html.                           The             National Map hydrography data is commonly combined with other data themes, such as boundaries, elevation, structures, and             transportation, to produce general reference base maps. The National Map viewer allows free downloads of public domain NHD and             WBD data in either Esri File or Personal Geodatabase, or Shapefile formats. </abstract>          <purpose>This dynamic overlay map service provides visualization of the free data that is available for download from The National             Map at http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer. </purpose>          <supplinf>See http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/help for assistance with The National Map viewer, services, or metadata.</supplinf>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <sngdate>                <caldate>2014</caldate>             </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <current>publication date</current>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>Complete</progress>          <update>As needed</update>       </status>       <spdom>          <bounding>             <westbc>-179.999</westbc>             <eastbc>-65</eastbc>             <northbc>71.5</northbc>             <southbc>17.625</southbc>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>NGDA Portfolio Themes</themekt>             <themekey>National Geospatial Data Asset</themekey>             <themekey>NGDA</themekey>             <themekey>Water Inland Theme</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>19115 Topic Category</themekt>             <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>none</themekt>             <themekey>a-16</themekey>             <themekey>water - inland</themekey>             <themekey>hydrography</themekey>             <themekey>NHD</themekey>             <themekey>water</themekey>             <themekey>drainage</themekey>             <themekey>river</themekey>             <themekey>stream</themekey>             <themekey>canal</themekey>             <themekey>ditch</themekey>             <themekey>lake</themekey>             <themekey>pond</themekey>             <themekey>reservoir</themekey>             <themekey>swamp</themekey>             <themekey>marsh</themekey>             <themekey>spring</themekey>             <themekey>well</themekey>             <themekey>dam</themekey>             <themekey>gage</themekey>             <themekey>gaging station</themekey>             <themekey>WBD</themekey>             <themekey>HU</themekey>             <themekey>hydrologic unit</themekey>             <themekey>region</themekey>             <themekey>subregion</themekey>             <themekey>basin</themekey>             <themekey>subbasin</themekey>             <themekey>watershed</themekey>             <themekey>subwatershed</themekey>             <themekey>NGP-TNM</themekey>             <themekey>REST</themekey>             <themekey>WMS</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>The National Map Theme Thesaurus</themekt>             <themekey>Hydrography</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>The National Map Type Thesaurus</themekt>             <themekey>Overlay Map Service</themekey>          </theme>          <place>             <placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt>             <placekey>US</placekey>             <placekey>United States</placekey>          </place>       </keywords>       <accconst>None</accconst>       <useconst>None.
