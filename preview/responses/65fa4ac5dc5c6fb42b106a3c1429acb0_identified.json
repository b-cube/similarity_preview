But <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management/people/ehaven\">Emmanuel Haven</a>, Professor in the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management\">School of Management</a>, argues that the rules of the quantum world can help us make sense of complex social systems, in collaboration with Professor <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://lnu.se/employee/andrei.khrennikov?l=en\">Andrei Khrennikov</a> of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://lnu.se/employee/andrei.khrennikov?l=en\">Linnaeus University</a> in Sweden.</p> <p>Professors Haven and Khrennikov propose that we apply \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdquantum-like\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd models to areas outside of the natural remit of quantum physics, such as social sciences. They argue that classical laws of probability often cannot apply to complex real-life situations, which are influenced by a blend of social, physical and financial factors. <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics\">Quantum mechanics </a>shows that in many cases, particles behave in relation to other particles: either through \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdentanglement\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (particles behaving as a unit even if they are far apart) or through \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcomplementarity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (the idea that it is impossible to distinguish between the behaviour of an atomic object and its interaction with the instrument observing it). The problem with classical probability laws is that they cannot accommodate context as quantum probability can.</p> <p>Haven and Khrennikov also hope to apply their research to understanding brain science, noting that quantum science has already kick-started the field of quantum-like artificial intelligence explored by Google and NASA. They are also looking at how voters are influenced by a stream of mass-media information: the so-called quantum master equation allows them to describe interactions between a social system and its environment, and thus the dynamics of voter\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds preferences.</p> <p>Quantum social science is still a young field, but\\ufffd\\ufffd scientists have been discussing the link between quantum physics and the human brain for some time: <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli\">Wolfgang Pauli</a>, winner of the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physics, proposed that the interaction between consciousness and unconsciousness could be understood in relation to complementarity.\\ufffd\\ufffd Similarly, over the past 15 years, there has been growing evidence that quantum mechanical processes can be applied to studying our sense of smell: it was proposed that a quantum mechanism is involved when odour molecules activate receptors in the nose.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>uatemp13</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-08-06T13:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2013/july/201cdon2019t-pull-that-201d-university-of-leicester-physics-students-investigate-bond-ejector-seat\">     <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDon\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt pull that!\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd University of Leicester physics students investigate Bond ejector seat</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2013/july/201cdon2019t-pull-that-201d-university-of-leicester-physics-students-investigate-bond-ejector-seat</link>     <description>Four-year Master of Physics students examine famous seat from Goldfinger</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Master\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds students at the University of Leicester's <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics\">Department of Physics and Astronomy </a>have explored the feasibility of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_bond\">James Bond\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds </a>DB5 ejector seat from <i><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldfinger_(film)\">Goldfinger</a></i>: That is, the one Bond uses to get rid of unwanted passengers.

Or if he preferred to keep his style intact he could opt for using active propulsion, such as jets to keep himself aloft.</p> <p>\"If he really wanted to stick with tradition he could follow the method of Gary Connery, who recently became the first person to glide to the ground from a helicopter using only a wingsuit, although he only made it down safely using a large number of cardboard boxes.\"</p> <p>The paper, entitled <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/484/289\">Trajectory of a falling Batman</a> was published in this year\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds University of Leicester <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/issue/current\"><em>Journal of Special Physics Topics</em></a>.</p> <p>The journal is published every year, and features original short papers written by students in the final year of their four-year Master of Physics degree.</p> <p>David added: \"This was an enjoyable module to be involved with, but it was also a lot harder work than it sounds. Each fortnight we had to write our own papers, review the papers of other groups, make corrections to our reviewed papers and put together an editorial board meeting to discuss the outcomes for the papers currently in the process of review.</p> <p>\"Choosing creative projects did make the task a little easier and more interesting. I believe the module is worthwhile, as learning how to approach new problems is an important part of being a physicist.\"</p> <p>Course leader Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer at the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics\" title=\"Physics And Astronomy\" class=\"internal-link\">Department of Physics and Astronomy</a>, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdA lot of the papers published in the Journal are on subjects that are amusing, topical, or a bit off-the-wall. Our fourth years are nothing if not creative! But, to be a research physicist - in industry or academia - you need to show some imagination, to think outside the box, and this is certainly something that the module allows our students to practice.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMost of our masters students hope to go on to careers in research where a lot of their time will be taken up with scientific publishing - writing and submitting papers, and writing and responding to referee reports.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThis is another area where the module really helps. Because <em>Physics Special Topics</em> is run exactly like a professional journal, the students get the chance to develop all the skills they will need when dealing with high profile journals like <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em> later on in life.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Film</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-07-09T14:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/december/nanoparticles-in-istanbul\">     <title>Nanoscience in Istanbul</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/december/nanoparticles-in-istanbul</link>     <description>Leicester establishing exchange link with leading nanotechnology centre.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Chris Binns from our Con<a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/research/cmp\" title=\"Condensed Matter Physics\" class=\"internal-link\">densed Matter Physics (CMP) Research Group</a> has recently returned from a trip to Turkey, laying the groundwork for a formal link between the University of Leicester and <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.fatih.edu.tr/\">Fatih University</a>.</p> <p>Fatih is a relatively new university, established 15 years ago with 12,000 undergraduates \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ten per cent of them from abroad \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd spread across two campuses in Ankara and Istanbul.

So there is a surprisingly large global market for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdless lethal weapons\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd; that is, devices designed to restrain, scare away or cause temporary pain to wrongdoers.</p> <p>The next public lecture from the <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/outreach/lpc\" title=\"Leicester Physics Centre\" class=\"internal-link\">Leicester Physics Centre</a> is a fascinating talk by Dr David Wilkinson from the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.iop.org/\">Institute of Physics</a> on \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Physics of Not Killing People\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. This is an area that Dr Wilkinson knows better than most folk because for several years he worked at the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/science-research/hosdb/\">Home Office Scientific Development Branch</a><strong>*</strong>, the Government body responsible for testing and evaluating the wide range of non-lethal weapons produced by companies worldwide.</p> <p>Less lethal weapons (there\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds a fairly obvious reason why the term \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnon-lethal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is generally avoided) include devices designed to restrain a person, which could be as simple as a net or as complex and impractical as a high-pressure jet of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsticky foam\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (great for stopping someone running away, less helpful afterwards when you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre trying to cuff them and get them into a van\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd).</p> <p>Water cannons are a well-known less lethal weapon, designed to disperse crowds, but are rarely used in the UK. As Dr Wilkinson explains, this is a simple matter of urban geography: water cannons are actually very vulnerable vehicles which require a surrounding cordon of riot police, the water jet blasting above their heads. This is a practical proposition in big squares and plazas, but British rioters very inconsiderately tend to cause their civil unrest in relatively narrow streets.</p> <p>Then there\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds the TASER<strong>**</strong>, invented in 1974, which fires two wires at a miscreant and zaps him with electricity. The intention is to hurt him sufficiently that he falls over and is too bothered about the (temporary) pain to resist arrest. Dr Wilkinson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds illustrated lecture includes some memorable video footage of macho American cops testing TASERs on each other and finding out how much they <em>really</em> hurt.</p> <p>Some of the photos in Dr Wilkinson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lecture are a tad on the gruesome side so this event isn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt recommended for small children, but for everyone else it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds an utterly fascinating, very educational \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and in places quite entertaining - look into a largely undocumented field where science meets law enforcement.</p> <p>The lecture, which is free and open to all, takes place in the Ken Edwards Building, Lecture Theatre 1, at 6.30pm on Tuesday 12 April 2011.

Since I started research I have been interested in the properties of helium clusters and helium droplets - condensed phases that contain a few up to millions of helium atoms. One aspect of my research concerns electronically excited states. The helium atom is the simplest of all many-electron atoms. A fundamental questions that strikes me is how electronically excited states become modified when an excited helium atom is placed near one, two or more helium atoms in the ground state. I tackle this problem using molecular beams of clusters and droplets of helium which allow their size to be varied, and synchrotron radiation to produce electronic excitations. Helium clusters in molecular beams are always liquid allowing to probe disordered arrangements of helium atoms.</p> <p>Another aspect of my research on helium is the interaction of molecules with helium. Rovibrational spectra show that molecules embedded in superfluid <sup>4</sup>He droplets rotate as if they were free, however, their rotation is somewhat slower than in vacuum. This difference in rotational speed reflects the interaction with the helium environment. My interest is to investigate these sometimes very subtle interactions using new spectroscopic approaches that are currently under development in my group. With these new techniques we expect to be able to investigate, for instance, the effect of\\ufffd\\ufffd thermodynamic phase changes, the on-set of superfluidity and resonances with local and global excitations.</p> <p>More recently, I have started investigating small clusters and nanoparticles of elements of technological relevance. In the focus are iron and silicon nanoparticles generated by using a range of innovative approaches developed in our group. We co-deposit silicon clusters with water vapour onto a cold target, melt the ice and obtain an aqueous suspension with exceptional optical stability: the clusters emit blue fluorescence in liquid water and show no signs of degrading. We also investigate the interaction with surfaces. AFM measurements of drops of silicon clusters placed on HOPG in ultra high vacuum show predominantly cluster heights of less than 1.5 nm and various forms of self-organisation.</p> <div id=\"thescrollscreen\"> <hr /> <h3>Peer Reviewed Published Papers</h3> <div>Many of my papers can be found with Google and Google Scholar.
