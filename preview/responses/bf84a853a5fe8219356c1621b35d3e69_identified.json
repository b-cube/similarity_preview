Lidar data will serve multiple purposes, but have primarily been collected to (1) evaluate active faulting, slope instability, thaw settlement, erosion, and other engineering constraints along proposed pipeline routes, and (2) provide a base layer for the state-federal GIS database that will be used to evaluate permit applications and construction plans. Bare-earth digital elevation models (DEM) represent the earth&apos;s surface with all vegetation and human-made structures removed.</abstract> <purpose>Provide high-resolution terrain elevation data.</purpose> <supplinf> This metadata file was written to document and describe, as a whole, all the bare-earth digital elevation model files generated for this project. The original metadata files provided by Watershed Sciences, Inc are also included in the download package and may provide additional useful information that is specific to each file. The metadata files provided by Watershed Sciences, Inc. have not been reviewed for accuracy or compliance with FGDC standards. For each data delivery area, reports documenting data collection methodology, accuracy, and quality control were provided by Watershed Sciences and the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (DOGAMI). These reports have been combined into single comprehensive reports organized by delivery region. The lidar QC report (the comprehensive report from DOGAMI) and the lidar delivery report (the comprehensive report from Watershed Sciences) can be found at http://www.dggs.alaska.gov/pubs/id/22722. Information about the quadrangles included in individual delivery regions can be found in the lidar delivery index report included with the data download. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to include several elements that are required to facilitate internal data management. These elements are refered to as layers. This dataset is described as a single layer titled:  &gt;bare_earth_dem bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>2010</begdate> <enddate>2011</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-150</westbc> <eastbc>-147</eastbc> <northbc>71</northbc> <southbc>70</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys</themekt> <themekey>Alaska Pipeline</themekey> <themekey>Bare-earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</themekey> <themekey>Gasline</themekey> <themekey>Geomorphology</themekey> <themekey>Lidar</themekey> <themekey>Proposed Natural Gas Pipeline</themekey> <themekey>Remote Sensing</themekey> <themekey>Raster Image</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys</placekt> <placekey>Beechey Point Quadrangle</placekey> <placekey>Alaska Highway Corridor</placekey> <placekey>Alaska, State of</placekey> <placekey>Trans-Alaska Pipeline</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>The dataset(s) is (are) available directly from the State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys (see contact information below).</accconst> <useconst>Any hard copies or published datasets utilizing these datasets shall clearly indicate their source.

Ground control points were collected by McClintock Land Associates, a licensed surveying company, to be used as control comparison with lidar elevations. Refer to the lidar delivery report and lidar QC report for more details on the accuracy of the lidar data for each delivery area, including a comparison of GCP elevations with bare-earth digital elevation model elevations.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>Lidar data have been examined to ensure that overlapping flight lines have consistent elevation values. Project specifications require that lidar consistency, measured as vertical offsets between adjacent flight lines, must average less than 0.15 meters. Refer to the lidar QC report and the lidar delivery report for statistics from consistency analyses for individual delivery sets. Flight lines have been examined to ensure that there was at least 60% sidelap and that there are no data gaps. Shaded relief, lidar slope, and bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) images have been visually inspected for data errors such as pits, border artifacts, gaps, and shifting. Additionally, all file naming conventions and formats have been checked for consistency.</logic> <complete>Lidar data have been checked for accuracy and completeness. Please refer to the lidar delivery report and lidar QC report for details about data accuracy completeness for individual delivery sets.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>True horizontal accuracy is regarded as a product of the lidar ground footprint. Lidar is referenced to co-acquired GPS base station data that have accuracies far greater than the value of the lidar footprint. The ground footprint is equal to 1/3333rd of the above - ground flying height. The ground footprint for data collected for this project exceeds typical accuracy of ground control used to reference the lidar data (less than 0.01 meters). Project specifications require the lidar footprint to be between 0.15 and 0.40 meters. Refer to the lidar QC report and lidar delivery report for additional information on horizontal accuracy for individual delivery areas.</horizpar> </horizpa> <vertacc> <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy was assessed by comparing GPS survey collected by McClintock Land Associates with lidar digital elevation models to expose offsets. Project specifications list the maximum root mean square vertical offset to be 0.20 meters.

The survey used the Leica ALS60 system. Near-nadir scan angles were used to increase penetration of vegetation to ground surfaces. Ground-level GPS and aircraft IMU were collected during the flight.</procdesc> <procdate>2010 and 2011</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Processing lidar data: (1) Flight lines and data were reviewed to ensure complete coverage of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. (2) Laser point-return coordinates were computed using ALS Post Processor software, IPAS Pro GPS/INS software, and Waypoint GPS, based on independent data from the lidar system, IMU, and aircraft. (3) The raw lidar file was assembled into flight lines per return with each point having an associated x, y, and z coordinate. (4) Visual inspection of swath-to-swath laser point consistencies in the study area were used to perform manual refinements of system alignment. (5) Custom algorithms were designed to evaluate points between adjacent flight lines. Automated system alignment was computed based on randomly selected swath-to-swath accuracy measurements that consider elevation, slope, and intensities. Specifically, refinement in the combination of system pitch, roll, and yaw-offset parameters optimize internal consistency. (6) Noise (e.g., pits and birds) was filtered using ALS post processing software, based on known elevation ranges, and included the removal of any cycle slips.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011 and 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Hydro-flattening: A combination of automated and manual detection and adjustment techniques was used to identify lake boundaries and water levels for closed water bodies with a surface area &gt; 150 square meters. Boundary polygons were developed using an algorithm that weights lidar - derived slopes, intensities, and return densities to detect the lake edge. Once detected, lake edges were manually reviewed and edited in a 3-D environment, and polygons were created with elevations computed from the filtered lidar returns. During the initial ground-modeling process returns from the water surface within each polygon were filtered and inspected for false low points. The elevation of each lake was computed as 5 cm above the minimum elevation of filtered-water surface cells within the lake polygon. Lake-boundary polygons were then incorporated into the final terrain model and enforced as hard breaklines. The initial ground classified-points falling within lake polygons were reclassified as water points and omitted from the final bare-earth DEM.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011 and 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Creation of bare-earth DEMs: (1) The TerraScan software suite was used to classify near-ground points. Geometric constraints were used to remove all points not near the earth. The resulting bare-earth ground model was then visually inspected and additional ground modeling was performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. (2) The corrected and filtered return points were compared to the real-time kinematic (RTK) ground survey points collected to verify the vertical and horizontal accuracies. (3) Points were output as laser points and, TINed, and GRIDed surfaces to create the bare-earth DEM.</procdesc> <procdate>2011 and 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>A metadata file was created to generally describe data acquisition of lidar and creation of bare-earth DEM&apos;s for the entire project.</procdesc> <procdate>2011</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>The bare earth digital elevation models (DEM) represent the earth&apos;s surface with all vegetation and human-made structures removed. The bare earth DEMs were derived from LiDAR data using TIN processing of the ground point returns. The DEM grid cell size is 1 meter. The elevation units are in meters. Some elevation values have been interpolated across areas in the ground model where there is no elevation data (e.g. over dense vegetation, water).</procdesc> <procdate>2011</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Raster</direct> <rastinfo> <rasttype>Grid Cell</rasttype> </rastinfo> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <gridsys> <gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>6</utmzone> <transmer> <sfctrmer>0.999600</sfctrmer> <longcm>-147</longcm> <latprjo>0.000000</latprjo> <feast>500000.000000</feast> <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth> </transmer> </utm> </gridsys> <planci> <plance>row and column</plance> <coordrep> <absres>1.000000</absres> <ordres>1.000000</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>meters</plandu> <pclname>bare_earth_dem</pclname> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn> <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257222</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum>North American Vertical Datum of 1988</altdatum> <altres>0.0000001</altres> <altunits>feet</altunits> <altenc>Attribute values</altenc> </altsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>be</enttypl> <enttypd>Bare earth digital elevation model (DEM)</enttypd> <enttypds>this report</enttypds> <ealname>bare_earth_dem</ealname> </enttyp> </detailed> <overview> <eaover>There are no attributes other than the encoded values for easting and northing coordinates.</eaover> <eadetcit>this report</eadetcit> <odlname>bare_earth_dem</odlname> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>3354 College Road</address> <city>Fairbanks</city> <state>AK</state> <postal>99709-3707</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>907-451-5020</cntvoice> <cntfax>907-451-5050</cntfax> <cntemail>dggspubs@alaska.gov</cntemail> <hours>8 am to 4:30 pm, Monday through Friday, except State holidays</hours> <cntinst>Please view our website (http://www.dggs.alaska.gov) for the latest information on available data.
