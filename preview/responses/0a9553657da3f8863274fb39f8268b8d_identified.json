Despite the fact that intensive efforts have been devoted into the field in the past decades, microfluidics has not yet been adopted widely. It is increasingly realized that an effective system integration strategy that is low cost and broadly applicable to various biological engineering situations is required to fully realize the potential of microfluidics. In this article, we review several promising system integration approaches for microfluidics and discuss their advantages, limitations, and applications. Future advancements of these microfluidic strategies will lead toward translational lab-on-a-chip systems for a wide spectrum of biological engineering applications.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/6</link>                 <dc:creator>Mandy LY Sin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jian Gao</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Joseph Liao</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Pak Kin Wong</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2011, null:6</dc:source>         <dc:date>2011-05-25T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-5-6</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-5-6-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>6</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2011-05-25T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/7/1/13\">         <title>A survey of enabling technologies in synthetic biology</title>         <description>Background: Realizing constructive applications of synthetic biology requires continued development of enabling technologies as well as policies and practices to ensure these technologies remain accessible for research. Broadly defined, enabling technologies for synthetic biology include any reagent or method that, alone or in combination with associated technologies, provides the means to generate any new research tool or application. Because applications of synthetic biology likely will embody multiple patented inventions, it will be important to create structures for managing intellectual property rights that best promote continued innovation. Monitoring the enabling technologies of synthetic biology will facilitate the systematic investigation of property rights coupled to these technologies and help shape policies and practices that impact the use, regulation, patenting, and licensing of these technologies. Results: We conducted a survey among a self-identifying community of practitioners engaged in synthetic biology research to obtain their opinions and experiences with technologies that support the engineering of biological systems. Technologies widely used and considered enabling by survey participants included public and private registries of biological parts, standard methods for physical assembly of DNA constructs, genomic databases, software tools for search, alignment, analysis, and editing of DNA sequences, and commercial services for DNA synthesis and sequencing. Standards and methods supporting measurement, functional composition, and data exchange were less widely used though still considered enabling by a subset of survey participants. Conclusions: The set of enabling technologies compiled from this survey provide insight into the many and varied technologies that support innovation in synthetic biology. Many of these technologies are widely accessible for use, either by virtue of being in the public domain or through legal tools such as non-exclusive licensing. Access to some patent protected technologies is less clear and use of these technologies may be subject to restrictions imposed by material transfer agreements or other contract terms. We expect the technologies considered enabling for synthetic biology to change as the field advances. By monitoring the enabling technologies of synthetic biology and addressing the policies and practices that impact their development and use, our hope is that the field will be better able to realize its full potential.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/7/1/13</link>                 <dc:creator>Linda Kahl</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Drew Endy</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2013, null:13</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-05-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-7-13</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-7-13-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>13</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-05-10T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/7/1/28\">         <title>Correlation between mass transfer coefficient kLa and relevant operating parameters in cylindrical disposable shaken bioreactors on a bench-to-pilot scale</title>         <description>Background: Among disposable bioreactor systems, cylindrical orbitally shaken bioreactors show important advantages. They provide a well-defined hydrodynamic flow combined with excellent mixing and oxygen transfer for mammalian and plant cell cultivations. Since there is no known universal correlation between the volumetric mass transfer coefficient for oxygen kLa and relevant operating parameters in such bioreactor systems, the aim of this current study is to experimentally determine a universal kLa correlation. Results: A Respiration Activity Monitoring System (RAMOS) was used to measure kLa values in cylindrical disposable shaken bioreactors and Buckingham&#8217;s &#960;-Theorem was applied to define a dimensionless equation for kLa. In this way, a scale- and volume-independent kLa correlation was developed and validated in bioreactors with volumes from 2 L to 200 L. The final correlation was used to calculate cultivation parameters at different scales to allow a sufficient oxygen supply of tobacco BY-2 cell suspension cultures. Conclusion: The resulting equation can be universally applied to calculate the mass transfer coefficient for any of seven relevant cultivation parameters such as the reactor diameter, the shaking frequency, the filling volume, the viscosity, the oxygen diffusion coefficient, the gravitational acceleration or the shaking diameter within an accuracy range of +/&#8722; 30%. To our knowledge, this is the first kLa correlation that has been defined and validated for the cited bioreactor system on a bench-to-pilot scale.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/7/1/28</link>                 <dc:creator>Wolf Kl\\ufffd\\ufffdckner</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Riad Gacem</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Tibor Anderlei</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Nicole Raven</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Stefan Schillberg</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Clemens Lattermann</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jochen B\\ufffd\\ufffdchs</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2013, null:28</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-12-02T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-7-28</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-7-28-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>28</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-12-02T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/3/1/11\">         <title>Solving a Hamiltonian Path Problem with a bacterial computer</title>         <description>Background: The Hamiltonian Path Problem asks whether there is a route in a directed graph from a beginning node to an ending node, visiting each node exactly once. The Hamiltonian Path Problem is NP complete, achieving surprising computational complexity with modest increases in size. This challenge has inspired researchers to broaden the definition of a computer. DNA computers have been developed that solve NP complete problems. Bacterial computers can be programmed by constructing genetic circuits to execute an algorithm that is responsive to the environment and whose result can be observed. Each bacterium can examine a solution to a mathematical problem and billions of them can explore billions of possible solutions. Bacterial computers can be automated, made responsive to selection, and reproduce themselves so that more processing capacity is applied to problems over time. Results: We programmed bacteria with a genetic circuit that enables them to evaluate all possible paths in a directed graph in order to find a Hamiltonian path. We encoded a three node directed graph as DNA segments that were autonomously shuffled randomly inside bacteria by a Hin/hixC recombination system we previously adapted from Salmonella typhimurium for use in Escherichia coli. We represented nodes in the graph as linked halves of two different genes encoding red or green fluorescent proteins. Bacterial populations displayed phenotypes that reflected random ordering of edges in the graph. Individual bacterial clones that found a Hamiltonian path reported their success by fluorescing both red and green, resulting in yellow colonies. We used DNA sequencing to verify that the yellow phenotype resulted from genotypes that represented Hamiltonian path solutions, demonstrating that our bacterial computer functioned as expected. Conclusion: We successfully designed, constructed, and tested a bacterial computer capable of finding a Hamiltonian path in a three node directed graph. This proof-of-concept experiment demonstrates that bacterial computing is a new way to address NP-complete problems using the inherent advantages of genetic systems. The results of our experiments also validate synthetic biology as a valuable approach to biological engineering. We designed and constructed basic parts, devices, and systems using synthetic biology principles of standardization and abstraction.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/3/1/11</link>                 <dc:creator>Jordan Baumgardner</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Karen Acker</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Oyinade Adefuye</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Samuel Crowley</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Will DeLoache</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>James Dickson</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Lane Heard</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Andrew Martens</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Nickolaus Morton</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Michelle Ritter</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Amber Shoecraft</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jessica Treece</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Matthew Unzicker</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Amanda Valencia</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mike Waters</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>A.

The pH, &#176;Brix, color parameters and microbial load of the treated apple juice were compared with those of thermally processed juice. Thermal processes were carried out at 35, 50, 65, 85&#176;C and treatment times ranging between 10 and 140 minutes. Microbial inactivation kinetics indicated that 5-log reduction of natural flora in apple juice was achieved at 85&#176;C and 60 minutes of treatment time for conventional thermal process and at 16.0 MPa, 60&#176;C and 40 minutes for HPCD process. Results suggested that temperature played a fundamental role on HPCD treatment efficiency, with inactivation significantly enhanced when it increased from 35 to 60&#176;C. Less significant was the role of the pressure at the tested levels of 7.0, 13.0 and 16.0 MPa. Also, 5-log reduction of natural flora in apple juice was obtained at lower temperatures by cyclic treatments of six compression and decompression steps. There were no significant differences between treated and untreated samples in &#176;Brix (&#945; = 0.05). Significant differences were detected in pH values between the untreated and HPCD treated samples (&#945; = 0.05). There was a significant decrease in &apos;L*&apos; and &apos;b*&apos; values and also differences were detected in &apos;a*&apos; values between the untreated and the HPCD treated samples (&#945; = 0.05). Statistical analysis for &#176;Brix, pH and color data showed no differences between the untreated and HPCD treated samples in the first 2 weeks of storage at 4&#176;C. These results emphasize the potential use of HPCD in industrial applications.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/3/1/3</link>                 <dc:creator>Giovanna Ferrentino</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mariacarmela Bruno</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Giovanna Ferrari</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Massimo Poletto</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Murat Balaban</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2009, null:3</dc:source>         <dc:date>2009-02-04T14:16:44Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-3-3</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-3-3-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>3</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2009-02-04T14:16:44Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/21\">         <title>Challenges in predicting the evolutionary maintenance of a phage transgene</title>         <description>Background: In prior work, a phage engineered with a biofilm-degrading enzyme (dispersin B) cleared artificial, short-term biofilms more fully than the phage lacking the enzyme. An unresolved question is whether the transgene will be lost or maintained during phage growth &#8211; its loss would limit the utility of the engineering. Broadly supported evolutionary theory suggests that transgenes will be lost through a &#8216;tragedy of the commons&#8217; mechanism unless the ecology of growth in biofilms meets specific requirements. We test that theory here. Results: Functional properties of the transgenic phage were identified. Consistent with the previous study, the dispersin phage was superior to unmodified phage at clearing short term biofilms grown in broth, shown here to be an effect attributable to free enzyme. However, the dispersin phage was only marginally better than control phages on short term biofilms in minimal media and was no better than control phages in clearing long term biofilms. There was little empirical support for the tragedy of the commons framework despite a strong theoretical foundation for its supposed relevance. The framework requires that the transgene imposes an intrinsic cost, yet the transgene was intrinsically neutral or beneficial when expressed from one part of the phage genome. Expressed from a different part of the genome, the transgene did behave as if intrinsically costly, but its maintenance did not benefit from spatially structured growth per se &#8211; violating the tragedy framework. Conclusions: Overall, the transgene was beneficial under many conditions, but no insight to its maintenance was attributable to the established evolutionary framework. The failure likely resides in system details that would be used to parameterize the models. Our study cautions against naive applications of evolutionary theory to synthetic biology, even qualitatively.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/21</link>                 <dc:creator>Matthew Schmerer</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ian Molineux</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Dilara Ally</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jabus Tyerman</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Nicole Cecchini</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>James Bull</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2014, null:21</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-08-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-8-21</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-8-21-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>21</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-08-01T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/5\">         <title>Engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts</title>         <description>Background: The underlying goal of synthetic biology is to make the process of engineering biological systems easier. Recent work has focused on defining and developing standard biological parts. The technical standard that has gained the most traction in the synthetic biology community is the BioBrick standard for physical composition of genetic parts. Parts that conform to the BioBrick assembly standard are BioBrick standard biological parts. To date, over 2,000 BioBrick parts have been contributed to, and are available from, the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. Results: Here we extended the same advantages of BioBrick standard biological parts to the plasmid-based vectors that are used to provide and propagate BioBrick parts. We developed a process for engineering BioBrick vectors from BioBrick parts. We designed a new set of BioBrick parts that encode many useful vector functions. We combined the new parts to make a BioBrick base vector that facilitates BioBrick vector construction. We demonstrated the utility of the process by constructing seven new BioBrick vectors. We also successfully used the resulting vectors to assemble and propagate other BioBrick standard biological parts. Conclusion: We extended the principles of part reuse and standardization to BioBrick vectors. As a result, myriad new BioBrick vectors can be readily produced from all existing and newly designed BioBrick parts. We invite the synthetic biology community to (1) use the process to make and share new BioBrick vectors; (2) expand the current collection of BioBrick vector parts; and (3) characterize and improve the available collection of BioBrick vector parts.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/2/1/5</link>                 <dc:creator>Reshma Shetty</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Drew Endy</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Thomas Knight</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2008, null:5</dc:source>         <dc:date>2008-04-14T18:16:02Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-2-5</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-2-5-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>5</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2008-04-14T18:16:02Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/7/1/14\">         <title>Model-driven elucidation of the inherent capacity of Geobacter sulfurreducens for electricity generation</title>         <description>Background: G. sulfurreducens is one of the commonest microbes used in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) for organic-to-electricity biotransformation. In MFCs based on this microorganism, electrons can be conveyed to the anode via three ways: 1) direct electron transfer (DET) mode, in which electrons of reduced c-type cytochromes in the microbial outer membrane are directly oxidized by the anode; 2) mediated electron transfer (MET) mode, in which the reducing potential available from cell metabolism in the form of NADH is targeted as an electron source for electricity generation with the aid of exogenous mediators; and 3) a putative mixed operation mode involving both electron transfer mechanisms described above (DET and MET). However, the potential of G. sulfurreducens for current output in these three operation modes and the metabolic mechanisms underlying the extraction of the reducing equivalents are still unknown. Results: In this study, we performed flux balance analysis (FBA) of the genome-scale metabolic network to compute the fundamental metabolic potential of G. sulfurreducens for current output that is compatible with reaction stoichiometry, given a realistic nutrient uptake rate. We also developed a method, flux variability analysis with target flux minimization (FATMIN) to eliminate futile NADH cycles. Our study elucidates the possible metabolic strategies to sustain the NADH for current production under the MET and Mixed modes. The results showed that G. sulfurreducens had a potential to output current at up to 3.710 A/gDW for DET mode, 2.711 A/gDW for MET mode and 3.272 A/gDW for a putative mixed MET and DET mode. Compared with DET, which relies on only one contributing reaction, MET and Mixed mode were more resilient with ten and four reactions respectively for high current production. Conclusions: The DET mode can achieve a higher maximum limit of the current output than the MET mode, but the MET has an advantage of higher power output and more flexible metabolic choices to sustain the electric current. The MET and DET modes compete with each other for the metabolic resource for the electricity generation.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/7/1/14</link>                 <dc:creator>Longfei Mao</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Wynand Verwoerd</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2013, null:14</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-05-29T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-7-14</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-7-14-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>14</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-05-29T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/2\">         <title>Molecular cloning using polymerase chain reaction, an educational guide for cellular engineering</title>         <description>Background: Over the last decades, molecular cloning has transformed biological sciences. Having profoundly impacted various areas such as basic science, clinical, pharmaceutical, and environmental fields, the use of recombinant DNA has successfully started to enter the field of cellular engineering. Here, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represents one of the most essential tools. Due to the emergence of novel and efficient PCR reagents, cloning kits, and software, there is a need for a concise and comprehensive protocol that explains all steps of PCR cloning starting from the primer design, performing PCR, sequencing PCR products, analysis of the sequencing data, and finally the assessment of gene expression. It is the aim of this methodology paper to provide a comprehensive protocol with a viable example for applying PCR in gene cloning. Results: Exemplarily the sequence of the tdTomato fluorescent gene was amplified with PCR primers wherein proper restriction enzyme sites were embedded. Practical criteria for the selection of restriction enzymes and the design of PCR primers are explained. Efficient cloning of PCR products into a plasmid for sequencing and free web-based software for the consecutive analysis of sequencing data is introduced. Finally, confirmation of successful cloning is explained using a fluorescent gene of interest and murine target cells. Conclusions: Using a practical example, comprehensive PCR-based protocol with important tips was introduced. This methodology paper can serve as a roadmap for researchers who want to quickly exploit the power of PCR-cloning but have their main focus on functional in vitro and in vivo aspects of cellular engineering.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/2</link>                 <dc:creator>Sayed Shahabuddin Hoseini</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Martin G Sauer</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2015, null:2</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-19T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-9-2</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-9-2-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>2</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-19T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/16\">         <title>Detection and quantification of poliovirus infection using FTIR spectroscopy and cell culture</title>         <description>Background: In a globalized word, prevention of infectious diseases is a major challenge. Rapid detection of viable virus particles in water and other environmental samples is essential to public health risk assessment, homeland security and environmental protection. Current virus detection methods, especially assessing viral infectivity, are complex and time-consuming, making point-of-care detection a challenge. Faster, more sensitive, highly specific methods are needed to quantify potentially hazardous viral pathogens and to determine if suspected materials contain viable viral particles. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy combined with cellular-based sensing, may offer a precise way to detect specific viruses. This approach utilizes infrared light to monitor changes in molecular components of cells by tracking changes in absorbance patterns produced following virus infection. In this work poliovirus (PV1) was used to evaluate the utility of FTIR spectroscopy with cell culture for rapid detection of infective virus particles. Results: Buffalo green monkey kidney (BGMK) cells infected with different virus titers were studied at 1 - 12 hours post-infection (h.p.i.). A partial least squares (PLS) regression method was used to analyze and model cellular responses to different infection titers and times post-infection. The model performs best at 8 h.p.i., resulting in an estimated root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 17 plaque forming units (PFU)/ml when using low titers of infection of 10 and 100 PFU/ml. Higher titers, from 103 to 106 PFU/ml, could also be reliably detected. Conclusions: This approach to poliovirus detection and quantification using FTIR spectroscopy and cell culture could potentially be extended to compare biochemical cell responses to infection with different viruses. This virus detection method could feasibly be adapted to an automated scheme for use in areas such as water safety monitoring and medical diagnostics.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/16</link>                 <dc:creator>Felipe Lee-Montiel</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kelly Reynolds</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mark Riley</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2011, null:16</dc:source>         <dc:date>2011-12-05T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-5-16</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-5-16-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>16</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2011-12-05T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <cc:License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#Reproduction\" />         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#Distribution\" />         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#DerivativeWorks\" />     </cc:License> </rdf:RDF> ",
