The data are meant to be normally used by quadrangle, or among adjacent quadrangles where temporally contiguous. The data can be used in any geographic application where intermediate scale land-use data are appropriate and the source land-cover map dates are representative of the time period of interest. </purpose>    <supplinf> This data set is released as part of an enhanced version of previously published USGS land-use and land-cover data, edited to perform attribute and geographic corrections, recast to the North American Horizontal Datum of 1983, and reformatted to the commonly used geospatial data file formats.   BACKGROUND  The following background information is extracted from:  U.S. Geological Survey, 1986, Land use and land cover digital data from 1:250,000- and 1:100,000-scale maps: Data User Guide 4, 25 p.   (This document is out of print, but was available online on July 1, 2005 at http://www.vterrain.org/Culture/LULC/Data_Users_Guide_4.html)    &quot;The characteristics of the digital cartographic data base for land Use  and land cover and associated maps reflect the parameters used in  compiling the maps. The Land Use and Land Cover mapping program is  designed so that standard topographic maps at a scale of l:250,000 can  be used as a base for compilation and reproduction. In a few cases, the  U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has prepared Land Use and Land Cover and  associated maps at a scale of 1:100,000 when the 1:100,000-scale  topographic map base was available...   Land Use and Land Cover maps provide data to be used either by  themselves or in combination with the other data sets produced in the  program. The basic sources of land use compilation data are NASA  high-altitude aerial photographs, and National High-Altitude Photography  (NHAP) program photographs, usually at scales smaller than l:60,000. The  l:250,000-scale topographic map series is generally used as the base map  for the compilation of the Land Use and Land Cover maps and the  associated overlays; 1:100,000-scale topographic map bases have been  used on rare occasions. Although compilation of Land Use and Land Cover  data is performed on a film-positive base usually enlarged to a scale of  approximately l:l25,000, the associated overlays are both compiled and  digitized at a scale of l:250,000.    Land Use and Land Cover data compilation is based upon the  classification system and definitions of Level II Land Use and Land  Cover [codes, (see below)]...  All features are delineated by curved or  straight lines that depict the actual boundaries of the areas (polygons)  being described. The minimum size of polygons depicting all Urban or  Built-up Land (categories 11-17), Water (51-54), Confined Feeding  Operations (23), Other Agricultural Land (24), Strip Mines, Quarries,  and Gravel Pits (75) and urban Transitional areas (76), is 4 hectares  (ha). All other categories of Land Use and Land Cover have a minimum  polygon size of 16 ha. (Those sizes also are considered the minimum  sizes to which polygons are digitized.) In the Urban or Built-up Land  and Water categories, the minimum width of a feature to be shown is 200 m;  (that is, if a square with sides 200 m in length is delineated, the  area will be 4 ha). Although the minimum-width consideration precludes  the delineation of very narrow and very long 4-ha polygons, triangles or  other polygons are acceptable if the base of the triangle or minimum  width of the polygon is 200 m in length and if the area of the polygon  is 4 ha. Exceptions to this specification are limited access highways  (14) and all double line rivers (51) on the 1:250,000-scale base which  shall have a minimum width of 92 m. For categories other than Urban or  Built-up Land and Water, the 16-ha minimum size for delineation requires  a minimum-width polygon of 400 m. Line weight for delineating Land Use  and Land Cover polygons and for neatlines is 0.l0 mm at the production  scale of l:250,000.&quot;   LAND-USE AND LAND-COVER CODES  These data sets represent land use and land cover using an integer value that references the Anderson level II classification system.   The first digit represents the level 1 land-use and land-cover code, and the second digit (ones place) represents a subdivision, or level 2 code.   The Anderson Level II land use codes used in this data set are listed below:    1  Urban or built-up land    11 Residental   12 Commercial and services   13 Industrial   14 Transportation, communication, utilities   15 Industrial and commercial complexes   16 Mixed urban or built-up land   17 Other urban or built-up land   2  Agricultural land    21 Cropland and pasture   22 Orchards, groves, vineyards, nurseries, and ornamental horticultural   23 Confined feeding operations   24 Other agricultural land   3  Rangeland    31 Herbaceous rangeland   32 Shrub and brush rangeland   33 Mixed rangeland   4  Forest land    41 Deciduous forest land   42 Evergreen forest land   43 Mixed forest land   5  Water    51 Streams and canals   52 Lakes   53 Reservoirs   54 Bays and estuaries   6  Wetland    61 Forested wetland   62 Nonforested wetland   7  Barren land    71 Dry salt flats   72 Beaches   73 Sandy areas not beaches   74 Bare exposed rock   75 Strip mines, quarries, gravel pits   76 Transitional areas   77 Mixed Barren Land   8  Tundra    81 Shrub and brush tundra   82 Herbaceous tundra   83 Bare ground   84 Wet tundra   85 Mixed tundra   9  Perennial snow or ice    91 Perennial snowfields   92 Glaciers  PROCESSING DETAILS  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) received the USGS land-use and and land-cover data files from USGS in 9-track ASCII format, one file per quadrangle.  Files were loaded onto the hard disk of the computer from tape. The data were then processed with the GIRASARC2 program written in Arc Macro Language (AML), which is part of the ArcInfo Geographic Information System (GIS) software. This program was developed by the USGS to process the data into a consistent ArcInfo format.   The GIRASARC2 AML &lt;http://www.epa.gov/ngispgm3/spdata/EPAGIRAS/meta/girasarc2.aml program does the following:   -- Converts the USGS data files to polygon coverage format.  -- Reconstructs topology, creating line and polygon features.  -- Linearly scales the map coordinates to UTM  using the registration points      listed in the USGS data file, and then modifies the coordinates to      Albers Equal Area projection.  -- Generates a quadrangle boundary polygon based on the mathematically-determined     corners of the map.  -- Loads available documentation into a series of companion documentation     files with each data set.    Another AML program (GIRASNEAT,  &lt;http://www.epa.gov/ngispgm3/spdata/EPAGIRAS/meta/girasneat.aml) does the following:   --clips the data to the neatline data set.  --dissolves polygon boundaries between polygons with the same land use code.  --snaps exterior arcs to the arcs of the neatline cover with a tolerance of    40 meters.  Data were reviewed visually by the user responsible for executing the GIRASARC2 program.   The GIRASARC2 and GIRASNEAT programs were executed in AML to create each quadrangle data set.   The processing described above was completed by the USEPA in the early 1990s. In 2001, the USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program needed a seamless data base of the conterminous United States, so data sets were further enhanced for use in the Program, as described below.   Additional land use and land cover data sets for Hawaii and one map sheet in Alaska were converted using the same AML programs and edited in a similar manner.  The Hawaii data sets were joined together into a single data set as they all are documented with the same source date and are more easily handled as a single data file.   These data files were then further edited to correct land-use coding errors caused by the misplacement of labels have also been corrected by visual inspection, checking the codes against the original labels in the GIRAS data files and ancillary land-cover data sets.  An AML menu-based application was used to assist in this process.   In addition to the processing describe above, the data were processed to fill in all gaps between quadrangles so that the data fits together seamlessly.  The polygon data were then transformed so that the horizontal coordinate data reference the North American Datum of 1983.  (The raw GIRAS-format data and the USEPA version of it is referenced to the North American Datum of 1927.) The geographic data files were also projected into geographic coordinates (decimal degrees of latitude and longitude).   Additional polygon data sets that document the land-use and land-cover data sets in a geographic context were created from the USEPA quadrangle index coverages with further editing based on information in the USGS data files posted on the USGS FTP site at the USGS EROS Data Center at:  ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/LULC  A summary of this effort was published as:  Price, C., Naomi, N., Hitt, K., and Clawges, R., 2003, Mining GIRAS: Improving on a national treasure of land use data, _in_ Proceedings of the 2004 ESRI International User Conference, July 7-11, 2003, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands Calif., 11p., available online at http://gis.esri.com/library/userconf/proc03/p0904.pdf  DATA FILE DESCRIPTIONS  Note that all data sets are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983.  1. tilepoly: Polygons representing each quadrangle tile.  2. src_poly: Polygons representing the extent of source files, with metadata about the source files used for each area. Some land-use files were merged from multiple GIRAS source files, some of which have different source dates.   3. gAABBB: Polygons for each 1:250,000 tile, where &quot;AA&quot; represents the latitude of the lower right corner and &quot;BBB&quot; represents the longitude of the lower right corner of the map tile.  These tile names are referenced in the polygon attributes of the tilepoly and src_poly polygon data sets described above.   The polygon data sets above are distributed as a collection of related files that make up the publicly documented ESRI shapefile format:   filename.shp ESRI shapefile geographic data file  filename.shx ESRI shapefile index data file  filename.dbf ESRI shapefile attribute file  filename.prj &quot;Well-Known-Text&quot; (WTK) format projection file  filename.shp..xml   metadata file   The shapefiles use geographic (decimal degree) coordinate data referenced to the North American Datum of 1983.   4. girasX Raster-format data, stored in six image files, in GeoTIFF format (with georeferencing included in the internal image header file).

The final data set is seamless and very closely match together at quad boundaries (although exact edgematching processing was not done, only tiny gaps exist between quadrangle tiles).   The quadrangles from Alaska and Hawaii were not available from EPA&apos;s collection of EXPORT files. They were downloaded from the USGS EROS ftp site at ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data/LULC. The GIRAS format files were converted to ArcInfo Coverage format. The Hawaii files were into a single data ArcInfo coverage, which was was given the tile label G18154.
