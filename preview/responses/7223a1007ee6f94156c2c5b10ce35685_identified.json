However, the theoretical&#13; number of deaths reduced by eliminating physical inactivity&#13; compared with overall and abdominal obesity remains unclear.&#13; Objective: We examined whether overall and abdominal adiposity&#13; modified the association between PA and all-cause mortality and estimated&#13; the population attributable fraction (PAF) and the years of life&#13; gained for these exposures.&#13; Design: This was a cohort study in 334,161 European men and&#13; women. The mean follow-up time was 12.4 y, corresponding to&#13; 4,154,915 person-years. Height, weight, and waist circumference&#13; (WC) were measured in the clinic. PA was assessed with a validated&#13; self-report instrument. The combined associations between&#13; PA, BMI, and WC with mortality were examined with Cox proportional&#13; hazards models, stratified by center and age group, and&#13; adjusted for sex, education, smoking, and alcohol intake. Centerspecific&#13; PAF associated with inactivity, body mass index (BMI; in&#13; kg/m2&#13; ) (.30), and WC ($102 cm for men, $88 cm for women)&#13; were calculated and combined in random-effects meta-analysis.&#13; Life-tables analyses were used to estimate gains in life expectancy&#13; for the exposures.&#13; Results: Significant interactions (PA 3 BMI and PA 3 WC) were&#13; observed, so HRs were estimated within BMI and WC strata. The hazards&#13; of all-cause mortality were reduced by 16\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd30% in moderately inactive&#13; individuals compared with those categorized as inactive in&#13; different strata of BMI and WC. Avoiding all inactivity would theoretically&#13; reduce all-cause mortality by 7.35% (95% CI: 5.88%, 8.83%).&#13; Corresponding estimates for avoiding obesity (BMI .30) were 3.66%&#13; (95% CI: 2.30%, 5.01%). The estimates for avoiding high WC were&#13; similar to those for physical inactivity.&#13; Conclusion: The greatest reductions in mortality risk were observed&#13; between the 2 lowest activity groups across levels of general and&#13; abdominal adiposity, which suggests that efforts to encourage even&#13; small increases in activity in inactive individuals may be beneficial to&#13; public health.

However, little is known regarding whether habitual rice consumption is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.&#13; &#13; Objective: We examined prospectively the association of white rice and brown rice consumption with CVD risk.&#13; &#13; Design: We followed a total of 207,556 women and men [73,228 women from the Nurses\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Health Study (1984\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2010), 92,158 women from the Nurses\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Health Study II (1991\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2011), and 42,170 men from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (1986\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2010)] who were free of CVD and cancer at baseline. Validated semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaires were used to assess consumption of white rice, brown rice, and other food items. Fatal and nonfatal CVD (coronary artery disease and stroke) was confirmed by medical records or self-reports.&#13; &#13; Results: During 4,393,130 person-years of follow-up, 12,391 cases of CVD were identified. After adjustment for major CVD risk factors, including demographics, lifestyle, and other dietary intakes, rice consumption was not associated with CVD risk. The multivariable-adjuted HR of developing CVD comparing \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd5 servings/wk with &lt;1 serving/wk was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.14) for white rice, 1.01 (0.79, 1.28) for brown rice, and 0.99 (0.90, 1.08) for total rice. To minimize the potential impact of racial difference in rice consumption, we restricted the analyses to whites only and obtained similar results: the HRs of CVD for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd5 servings/wk compared with &lt;1 serving/wk were 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.22) for white rice and 1.01 (0.78, 1.31) for brown rice.&#13; &#13; Conclusions: Greater habitual consumption of white rice or brown rice is not associated with CVD risk. These findings suggest that rice consumption may not pose a significant CVD risk among the U.S. population when consumed at current amounts. More prospective studies are needed to explore these associations in other populations.

Cell competition where \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdloser\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd cells are eliminated by neighbors with higher fitness is a widespread phenomenon in development. However, a growing body of evidence argues cells with somatic mutations compete with their wild type counterparts in the earliest stages of cancer development. Recent studies have begun to shed light on the molecular and cellular mechanisms that alter the competitiveness of cells carrying somatic mutations in adult tissues. Cells with a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwinner\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd phenotype create clones which may expand into extensive fields of mutant cells within normal appearing epithelium, favoring the accumulation of further genetic alterations and the evolution of cancer. Here we focus on how mutations which disrupt the Notch signaling pathway confer a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuper competitor\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd status on cells in squamous epithelia and consider the broader implications for cancer evolution.

Data were from the Allied&#13; Dunbar National Fitness Survey, a population-based prospective&#13; cohort comprising 1,796 male and 2,122 female&#13; participants aged 16\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd96 years, randomly selected from 30&#13; English constituencies in 1990. Participants were tagged&#13; for mortality at the Office for National Statistics. Cox&#13; multivariable regression quantified the association between&#13; self-reported achievement of activity guidelines\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd150 min&#13; of at least moderate activity per week, equivalent here to 30&#13; or more 20-min episodes of at least moderate activity per&#13; month\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdand mortality adjusting for age, sex, smoking&#13; status, social class, geographical area, anxiety/depression&#13; and interview season. There were 1,175 deaths over a&#13; median (IQR) of 22.9 (3.9) years follow-up; a mortality&#13; rate of 15.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 14.4\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd16.1 per&#13; 1,000 person years. Compared with being inactive (no&#13; 20-min bouts per month), meeting activity guidelines (30?&#13; bouts) was associated with a 25 % lower mortality rate,&#13; adjusting for measured confounders. If everyone adhered to&#13; recommended-, or even low-activity levels, a substantial&#13; proportion of premature mortality might be avoided (PAF,&#13; 95 % CI 20.6, 6.9\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd32.3 and 8.9, 4.2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd13.4 %, respectively).&#13; Among a representative English population, adherence to&#13; activity guidelines was associated with significantly&#13; reduced mortality. Efforts to increase population-wide&#13; activity levels could produce large public health benefits&#13; and should remain a focus of health promotion efforts. This is the final published version.
