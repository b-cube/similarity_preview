Stock status includes overfishing, overfished, and approaching overfished condition; for FSSI stocks B/Bmsy estimates and FSSI scor are also included.  Files are in PDF format and are posted quarterly on the Office of Sustainable Fisheries website.  The FSSI is a performance measure for the sustainability of 230 US fish stocks selected for their importance to commercial and recreational fisheries, and their ability to be assessed.  The FSSI will increase as stock status becomes known, overfishing has ended, and stocks increase to a level that provides maximum sustainable yield.  B/Bmsy is a measure of current stock biomass relative to the target biomass level (the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield, or MSY).  FSSI scores are updated quarterly and are available from 2005 to present.  Data are derived from data entered in the Species Informaiton System (SIS) database, maintained by the Office of Science and Technology.</dcterms:abstract>    <dc:publisher>NMFS Office Of Sustainable Fisheries</dc:publisher>    <dc:creator>Greene, Karen E</dc:creator>    <dc:creator>NMFS Office Of Sustainable Fisheries</dc:creator>    <dc:identifier xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/12821</dc:identifier>    <dcterms:isPartOf xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/12801</dcterms:isPartOf>    <dcterms:spatial>                         name=US National, EEZ;                     </dcterms:spatial>    <dcterms:temporal xsi:type=\"dcterms:Period\">                           start=2005;                         </dcterms:temporal> </metadata> ",
