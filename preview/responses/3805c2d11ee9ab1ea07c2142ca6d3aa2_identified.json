The surveys were commissioned by the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations for the purpose of answering certain questions relating to foreign policy. Questionnaires were developed and implemented by Louis Harris and Associates, Inc. Many questions asked in both surveys were identical in order to facilitate a comparison of the kind and frequency of responses. Data are provided on the attitudes and opinions of the public and the leaders on the extent and role of United States' involvement in world affairs and the amount of domestic support for this involvement, how and by whom the United States' foreign policy should be formed, and the relationship between domestic and foreign policies in the context of growing United States' interdependence with other countries. The Leadership Sample data file (Part 1) consists of a sample of 330 Americans in leadership positions drawn in roughly equal proportions from the following sub-populations: senators and representatives, officials of the Department of State, officials with international responsibilities from other government departments, the business community, communications, and education. Also, in somewhat smaller numbers, leaders were drawn from major labor unions and ethnic and religious organizations. The Public Sample data file (Part 2) consists of a stratified systematic national sample of 1,513 American respondents.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1974\" cycle=\"P1\">1974</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1974-12-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1974-12-06</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1974-12-29\" cycle=\"P1\">1974-12-29</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                        <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    National sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized   population of the United States aged 18 and older, and Americans in  leadership positions 1974.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews and self-enumerated questionnaires             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>               <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR05808.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
