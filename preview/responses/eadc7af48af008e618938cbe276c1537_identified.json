This memo       describes one rate measurement problem and presents a rate-measurement       problem statement for test protocols to measure IP Performance Metrics       (IPPM).</t>        <t>When selecting a form of access to the Internet, subscribers are       interested in the performance characteristics of the various       alternatives. Standardized measurements can be a basis for comparison       between these alternatives. There is an underlying need to coordinate       measurements that support such comparisons, and test control protocols       to fulfill this need. The figure below depicts some typical measurement       points of access networks.</t>        <t><figure>           <artwork><![CDATA[ User     /====== Fiber =======  Access Node \\\\  Device -|------ Copper -------  Access Node -|-- Infrastructure -- GW  or Host  \\\\------ Radio -------  Access Node /  ]]></artwork>         </figure></t>        <t>The access-rate scenario or use case has received wide-spread       attention of Internet access subscribers and seemingly all Internet       industry players, including regulators. This problem is being approached       with many different measurement methods.</t>     </section>      <section title=\"Purpose and Scope\">       <t>The scope and purpose of this memo is to define the measurement       problem statement for test protocols conducting access rate measurement       on production networks. Relevant test protocols include <xref       target=\"RFC4656\"/> and <xref target=\"RFC5357\"/>, but the problem is       stated in a general way so that it can be addressed by any existing test       protocol, such as <xref target=\"RFC6812\"/>.</t>        <t>This memo discusses possibilities for methods of measurement, but       does not specify exact methods which would normally be part of the       solution, not the problem.</t>        <t>We are interested in access measurement scenarios with the following       characteristics:<list style=\"symbols\">           <t>The Access portion of the network is the focus of this problem           statement. The user typically subscribes to a service with           bi-directional access partly described by rates in bits per second.           The rates may be expressed as raw capacity or restricted capacity as           described in <xref target=\"RFC6703\"/>. These are the quantities that           must be measured according to one or more standard metrics, and for           which measurement methods must also be agreed as a part of the           solution.</t>            <t>Referring to the reference path illustrated below and defined in           <xref target=\"I-D.ietf-ippm-lmap-path\"/>, possible measurement           points include a Subscriber's host, the access service demarcation           point, Intra IP access where a globally routable address is present,           or the gateway between the measured access network and other           networks. <figure align=\"center\">               <artwork><![CDATA[Subsc. -- Private -- Private -- Access -- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit device     Net #1     Net #2    Demarc.

These scenarios       could include mobile backhaul, Ethernet Service access networks, and/or       extensions of layer 2 or layer 3 networks. The results of rate       measurements in such cases could be employed to select alternate       routing, investigate whether capacity meets some previous agreement,       and/or adapt the rate of traffic sources if a capacity bottleneck is       found via the rate measurement. In the case of aggregated leased       networks, available capacity may also be asymmetric. In these cases, the       tester is assumed to have a sender and receiver location under their       control. We refer to this scenario below as the aggregated leased       network case.</t>        <t>This memo describes protocol support for active measurement methods,       consistent with the IPPM working group's traditional charter. Active       measurements require synthetic traffic streams dedicated to testing, and       do not make measurements on user traffic. See section 2 of <xref       target=\"RFC2679\"/>, where the concept of a stream is first introduced in       IPPM literature as the basis for collecting a sample (defined in section       11 of <xref target=\"RFC2330\"/>).</t>        <t>As noted in <xref target=\"RFC2330\"/> the focus of access traffic       management may influence the rate measurement results for some forms of       access, as it may differ between user and test traffic if the test       traffic has different characteristics, primarily in terms of the packets       themselves (see section 13 of <xref target=\"RFC2330\"/> for the       considerations on packet type, or Type-P).</t>        <t>There are several aspects of Type-P where user traffic may be       examined and selected for special treatment that may affect transmission       rates. Without being exhaustive, the possibilities include:</t>        <t><list style=\"symbols\">           <t>Packet length</t>            <t>IP addresses</t>            <t>Transport protocol (e.g. where TCP packets may be routed           differently from UDP)</t>            <t>Transport Protocol port numbers</t>         </list></t>        <t>This issue requires further discussion when specific       solutions/methods of measurement are proposed, but for this problem       statement it is sufficient to identify the problem and indicate that the       solution may require an extremely close emulation of user traffic, in       terms of one or more factors above.</t>        <t>Although the user may have multiple instances of network access       available to them, the primary problem scope is to measure one form of       access at a time. It is plausible that a solution for the single access       problem will be applicable to simultaneous measurement of multiple       access instances, but treatment of this scenario is beyond the current       scope this document.</t>        <t>A key consideration is whether active measurements will be conducted       with user traffic present (In-Service testing), or not present       (Out-of-Service testing), such as during pre-service testing or       maintenance that interrupts service temporarily. Out-of-Service testing       includes activities described as \"service commissioning\", \"service       activation\", and \"planned maintenance\". Opportunistic In-Service testing       when there is no user traffic present (e.g., outside normal business       hours) throughout the test interval is essentially equivalent to       Out-of-Service testing. Both In-Service and Out-of-Service testing are       within the scope of this problem.</t>        <t>It is a non-goal to solve the measurement protocol specification       problem in this memo.</t>        <t>It is a non-goal to standardize methods of measurement in this memo.       However, the problem statement mandates support for one category of rate       measurement methods in the test protocol and adequate control features       for the methods in the control protocol (assuming the control and test       protocols are separate).</t>     </section>      <section title=\"Active Rate Measurement\">       <t>This section lists features of active measurement methods needed to       measure access rates in production networks.</t>        <t>Coordination between source and destination devices through control       messages and other basic capabilities described in the methods of IPPM       RFCs <xref target=\"RFC2679\"/><xref target=\"RFC2680\"/>, and assumed for       test protocols such as <xref target=\"RFC5357\"/> and <xref       target=\"RFC4656\"/>, are taken as given.</t>        <t>Most forms of active testing intrude on user performance to some       degree, especially In-Service testing. One key tenet of IPPM methods is       to minimize test traffic effects on user traffic in the production       network. Section 5 of <xref target=\"RFC2680\"/> lists the problems with       high measurement traffic rates (\"too much traffic\"), and the most       relevant for rate measurement is the tendency for measurement traffic to       skew the results, followed by the possibility of introducing congestion       on the access link. Section 4 of <xref target=\"RFC3148\"/> provides       additional considerations. The user of protocols for In-Service testing       MUST respect these traffic constraints. Obviously, categories of rate       measurement methods that use less active test traffic than others with       similar accuracy are preferred for In-Service testing, and the       specifications of this memo encourage traffic reduction through       asymmetric control capabilities.</t>        <t>Out-of-Service tests where the test path shares no links with       In-Service user traffic, have none of the congestion or skew concerns.       Both types should address practical matters common to all test efforts,       such as conducting measurements within a reasonable time from the       tester's point of view, and ensuring that timestamp accuracy is       consistent with the precision needed for measurement <xref       target=\"RFC2330\"/>. Out-of-Service tests where some part of the test       path is shared with In-Service traffic MUST respect the In-Service       constraints described above.</t>        <t>The intended metrics to be measured have strong influence over the       categories of measurement methods required. For example, using the       terminology of <xref target=\"RFC5136\"/>, it may be possible to measure a       Path Capacity Metric while In-Service if the level of background (user)       traffic can be assessed and included in the reported result.</t>        <t>The measurement *architecture* MAY be either of one-way (e.g., <xref       target=\"RFC4656\"/>) or two-way (e.g., <xref target=\"RFC5357\"/>), but the       scale and complexity aspects of end-user or aggregated access       measurement clearly favor two-way (with low-complexity user-end device       and round-trip results collection, as found in <xref       target=\"RFC5357\"/>). However, the asymmetric rates of many access       services mean that the measurement system MUST be able to evaluate       performance in each direction of transmission. In the two-way       architecture, both end devices MUST include the ability to launch test       streams and collect the results of measurements in both (one-way)       directions of transmission (this requirement is consistent with previous       protocol specifications, and it is not a unique problem for rate       measurements).</t>        <t>The following paragraphs describe features for the roles of test       packet SENDER, RECEIVER, and results REPORTER.</t>        <t>SENDER:</t>        <t>Generate streams of test packets with various characteristics as       desired (see Section 4). The SENDER MAY be located at the user end of       the access path or elsewhere in the production network, such as at one       end of an aggregated leased network segment.</t>        <t>RECEIVER:</t>        <t>Collect streams of test packets with various characteristics (as       described above), and make the measurements necessary to support rate       measurement at the receiving end of an access or aggregated leased       network segment.</t>        <t>REPORTER:</t>        <t>Use information from test packets and local processes to measure       delivered packet rates, and prepare results in the required format (the       REPORTER role may be combined with another role, most likely the       SENDER).</t>     </section>      <section title=\"Measurement Method Categories\">       <t>A protocol that addresses the rate measurement problem MUST serve the       test stream generation and measurement functions (SENDER and RECEIVER).

Other stream generation categories are OPTIONAL.</t>        <t>For all supported categories, the following is a list of additional       variables that the protocol(s) MUST be able to specify, control, and       generate:</t>        <t><list style=\"letters\">           <t>Variable payload lengths among packet streams</t>            <t>Variable length (in packets) among packet streams or           ensembles</t>            <t>Variable IP header markings among packet streams</t>            <t>Choice of UDP transport and variable port numbers, OR, choice of           TCP transport and variable port numbers for two-way architectures           only, OR BOTH.

Another OPTIONAL feature is the ability to generate streams       with VLAN tags and other markings.</t>        <t>For measurement systems employing TCP as the transport protocol, the       ability to generate specific stream characteristics requires a sender       with the ability to establish and prime the connection such that the       desired stream characteristics are allowed.

Two-way architectures are RECOMMENDED to       include control and generation capability for both asymmetric and       symmetric packet sizes, because packet size often matters in the scope       of this problem and test systems SHOULD be equipped to detect       directional size dependency through comparative measurements.</t>        <t>Asymmetric packet size control is indicated when the result of a       measurement may depend on the size of the packets used in each       direction, i.e. when any of the following conditions hold: <list           style=\"symbols\">           <t>there is a link in the path with asymmetrical capacity in           opposite directions (in combination with one or more of the           conditions below, but their presence or specific details may be           unknown to the tester),</t>            <t>there is a link in the path which aggregates (or divides) packets           into link-level frames, and may have a capacity that depends on           packet size, rate, or timing,</t>            <t>there is a link in the path where transmission in one direction           influences performance in the opposite direction,</t>            <t>there is a device in the path where transmission capacity depends           on packet header processing capacity (in other words, the capacity           is sensitive to packet size),</t>            <t>the target application stream is nominally MTU size packets in           one direction vs. ACK stream in the other, (noting that there are a           vanishing number of symmetrical-rate application streams for which           rate measurement is wanted or interesting, but such streams might           have some relevance at this time),</t>            <t>the distribution of packet losses is critical to rate           assessment,</t>         </list></t>        <t>and possibly other circumstances revealed by measurements comparing       streams with symmetrical size and asymmetrical size.</t>        <t>Implementations may support control and generation for only symmetric       packet sizes when none of the above conditions hold.</t>        <t>The test protocol SHOULD enable measurement of the <xref       target=\"RFC5136\"/> Capacity metric, either Out-of-Service, In-Service,       or both.

See <xref target=\"RFC4656\"/>       and <xref target=\"RFC5357\"/>.</t>        <t>There may be a serious issue if a proprietary Service Level Agreement       involved with the access network segment provider were somehow leaked in       the process of rate measurement. To address this, test protocols SHOULD       NOT convey this information in a way that could be discovered by       unauthorized parties.</t>     </section>      <section title=\"Operational Considerations\">       <t>All forms of testing originate traffic on the network, through their       communications for control and results collection, or from dedicated       measurement packet streams, or both. Testing traffic primarily falls in       one of two categories, subscriber traffic or network management traffic.       There is an on-going need to engineer networks so that various forms of       traffic are adequately served, and publication of this memo does not       change this need. Service subscribers and authorized users SHOULD obtain       their network operator's or service provider's permission before       conducting tests. Likewise, a service provider or third party SHOULD       obtain the subscriber's permission to conduct tests, since they might       temporarily reduce service quality.</t>        <t>Subscribers, their service providers and network operators, and       sometimes third parties, all seek to measure network performance.       Capacity testing with active traffic often affects the packet transfer       performance of streams traversing shared components of the test path, to       some degree. The degradation can be minimized by scheduling such tests       infrequently, and restricting the amount of measurement traffic required       to assess capacity metrics. As a result, occasional short-duration       estimates with minimal traffic are preferred to measurements based on       frequent file transfers of many Megabytes with similar accuracy. New       measurement methodologies intended for standardization should be       evaluated individually for potential operational issues. However, the       scheduled frequency of testing is as important as the methods used (and       schedules are not typically submitted for standardization).</t>        <t>The new test protocol feature of asymmetrical packet size generation       in two-way testing is recommended in this memo. It can appreciably       reduce the load and packet processing demands of each test and therefore       reduce the likelihood of degradation in one direction of the tested       path. Current IETF standardized test protocols do not possess the       asymmetric size generation capability with two-way testing.</t>     </section>      <section anchor=\"IANA\" title=\"IANA Considerations\">       <t>This memo makes no requests of IANA.</t>     </section>      <section anchor=\"Acknowledgements\" title=\"Acknowledgements\">       <t>Dave McDysan provided comments and text for the aggregated leased use       case.

Barry       Constantine also provided suggestions for clarification.</t>     </section>   </middle>    <back>     <references title=\"Normative References\">       <?rfc include=\"reference.RFC.2119\"?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.2330'?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.2679'?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.2680'?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.4656'?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.5357'?>        <?rfc ?>        <?rfc ?>        <?rfc ?>        <?rfc ?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.6703'?>     </references>      <references title=\"Informative References\">       <?rfc include='reference.RFC.3148'?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.6812'?>        <?rfc include='reference.RFC.5136'?>        <?rfc include='reference.I-D.ietf-ippm-lmap-path'?>        <?rfc ?>        <?rfc include='reference.I-D.ietf-ippm-model-based-metrics'?>        <?rfc ?>     </references>   </back> </rfc> ",
