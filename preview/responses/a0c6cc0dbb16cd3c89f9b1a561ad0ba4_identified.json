The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and the Minneapolis Office of NatureServe in Minneapolis, Minnesota, have completed mapping and classification of existing plant communities of Effigy Mounds National Monument (EFMO) and extended surroundings. Photointerpreters, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to describe National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) plant communities (associations) and determine how best to map them using aerial photographs. --- Two vegetation map coverages were produced, the Yellow River and Sny Magill Units and their respective environs. Vegetation and land use were interpreted using high-quality mirror stereoscopes and 1:8,000-scale color infrared aerial photographs dated October 9, 2000. Polygons were mapped to 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) and, for specific classes, to 0.1 ha (0.25 acres). The interpreted data were digitally and spatially referenced using state-of-the-art mapping software, making the map data usable in geographic information systems (GIS). --- Covering 4,972 ha (12,286 acres), 2,844 polygons make up the 2 geospatial map coverages with an average polygon size of 1.7 ha (4.3 acres). Of the area mapped, 2,179 polygons (76.6%) represent NVCS plant communities as defined by NatureServe. Those polygons cover 3,167 ha (7,825 acres; 63.7%) of the total map area. Another 529 polygons (18.6%) represent NVCS Formation level types covering 1,316 ha (3,251 acres; 26.5%) of the total map area. The remaining 136 polygons (4.8%) represent land use features covering 489 ha (1,208 acres; 9.8%). EFMO lands comprise 1,022 ha (2,526 acres; 20.6%) of the map coverage area. About 563 ha (1,390 acres; 11.3%) of the map coverage area is of Iowa's Yellow River State Forest. --- Results from a thematic accuracy assessment of map classes representing NVCS plant communities provide an overall accuracy of 92% (Kappa index of 90%). Most individual map class themes exceed the VMP standard of 80% with a 90% confidence interval. --- The vegetation spatial database coverages are projected in Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), Zone 15, using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).</abstract>       <purpose>The vegetation spatial database coverage was produced for the Effigy Mounds National Monument Vegetation Mapping Project, USGS-NPS VMP. The focus of this metadata report centers on the vegetation map coverage and not necessarily the vegetation classification or accuracy assessment. Although references are made to classification and accuracy assessment, their documentation are found in separate metadata reports and in the EFMO Project Report.</purpose>       <supplinf>The vegetation mapping team collected 63 vegetation plot samples for analyses, defining 15 NVCS plant communities. Two plant communities were added based on less formal sampling data, affirming 17 NVCS plant communities at EFMO. An additional 10 vegetation units were classed at the NVCS Formation level depicting human disturbance and cultivated lands. --- Of 47 map classes developed for the mapping project, 30 represent the 17 NVCS plant communities. Plant communities, primarily forested types, were subdivided to provide resource managers and researchers information the plant community level could not provide. These map class phases typically define recurring variations within a plant community and suggest an index to disturbance history and integrity of the plant community. Another 9 map classes represent the 10 NVCS Formation level vegetation units, and an additional 8 map classes depict general land cover of land use and open water, closely representing Level II of USGS Land Use and Land Cover (LUC) classification. --- A detailed listing of map classes and their link to the NVCS or USGS LUC classifications (plus listing of physiognomic modifiers that are added to map classes representing vegetation) is provided in the Entity and Attribute Information section of this metadata report. They are also listed in the EFMO Project Report. --- The vegetation spatial database coverages are available in ArcInfo Export (e00) and Spatial Database Transfer Standard formats at the USGS-NPS VMP's Internet site.</supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <sngdate>           <caldate>20050131</caldate>         </sngdate>       </timeinfo>       <current>publication date</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>None planned</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <descgeog>Effigy Mounds National Monument in northeast Iowa, including the Yellow River and Sny Magill Units, and extended environs. --- Bounding Coordinates for the Yellow River unit coverage: North 43.146414, East -91.172366, South 43.043555, West -91.252281.

(For more information on VMP, see larger work citation below.) The goals of the project are to adequately describe and map plant communities of EFMO and immediate surroundings and to provide the NPS Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) Program, resource managers, and biological researchers with useful baseline vegetation information. The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) in La Crosse, Wisconsin, and the Minneapolis Office of NatureServe in Minneapolis, Minnesota, have mapped and classified the existing plant communities at EFMO and extended surroundings. --- Common to all VMP mapping projects, the three major components of the EFMO Vegetation Mapping Project are vegetation classification, vegetation mapping, and map accuracy assessment. Two sets of aerial photographs were collected during summer and fall of 2000, and the mapping project was officially inaugurated spring 2001 with a scoping meeting where partners discussed the project's objectives, goals, and methods. Photointerpreters, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to describe National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) plant associations (communities) and determine how best to map them using the aerial photographs. Plant community descriptions were derived from analyses of vegetation sampling data at EFMO. These plant communities, along with NVCS Formation vegetation units depicting human disturbance and cultivated lands and with units describing human-made structures, were interpreted and mapped using aerial photographs and mirror stereoscopes. Spatial database coverages were produced of the Yellow River and Sny Magill units and their respective environs using state-of-the-art photogrammetric and GIS software. An accuracy assessment of the map coverages were performed on map classes representing NVCS plant communities, with results exceeding VMP standards. --- The EFMO project delivers many geospatial and vegetation data products in hard copy and digital formats, including an in-depth project summary report discussing methods and results, plant community descriptions and dichotomous key, representative ground photos of plant communities, a database containing the plot samples and accuracy assessment, field data sheets, aerial photograph prints and images (including geo-referenced photo mosaics), map classification and descriptions, and spatial coverages and maps of plant communities, fieldwork locations, aerial photo indexes, and project boundaries (each supported with metadata reports). All geospatial products are in Universal Transverse Mercator projection, Zone 15, using North American Datum of 1983.

This landmark program is both the first to provide national-scale descriptions of vegetation for a federal agency and the first to create national vegetation standards for its data products. Its goal is to meet specific information needs identified by the National Park Service. --- The vegetation mapping program is an important part of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program, a long-term effort to develop baseline data for all national park units that have a natural resource component. It is managed by the USGS Center for Biological Informatics, a unique information center designed to help scientists, land managers, the public, and others locate and apply biological information. --- Program activities are based on peer-reviewed, objective science. Comprehensive vegetation information is provided at national and regional levels, while also serving local management needs of individual parks. Stringent quality control procedures ensure that products are accurate and consistent for initial inventory purposes and replicable for monitoring purposes. The spatially enabled digital products produced by the program are available on the World Wide Web. --- Program scientists have developed data collection procedures for classification, mapping, accuracy assessment, and use of existing data. Program products meet Federal Geographic Data Committee standards for vegetation classification and metadata, and national standards for spatial accuracy and data transfer. Standards include a minimum mapping unit of 0.5 hectares and classification accuracy of 80% for each map class. Nature Serve, an important partner in the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping program, is the caretaker of the National Vegetation Classification System, which is used by the program to classify vegetation communities. --- A report of project methods and results is provided at completion of individual projects. Project results include a rich set of data and information for each park project, as follows: --- Spatial Data: Aerial photography, Map classification, Map classification description and key, Spatial database of vegetation communities, Hardcopy maps of vegetation communities, Metadata for spatial databases, Complete accuracy assessment of spatial data, Vegetation Information. --- Vegetation classification: Dichotomous field key of vegetation classes, Formal description for each vegetation class, Ground photos of vegetation classes, Field data in database format.</othercit>             <onlink>http://www.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/vip/index.html</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </lworkcit>       </citeinfo>     </crossref>   </idinfo>   <dataqual>     <attracc>       <attraccr>ased on results of a thematic accuracy assessment, the estimated overall accuracy for map classes representing National Vegetation Classification System (NVCS) natural/semi-natural associations (plant communities) is 92%, with a kappa index of 90%.</attraccr>     </attracc>     <logic>All polygon features were checked for topology and existence of label points using ArcInfo (Version 8.0.2).

The U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) of La Crosse, Wisconsin collected the aerial photographs in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Region 3 of Ft. Snelling, Minnesota. Funding for this effort was provided by the National Park Service. Mounted in a USFWS Partenavia twin-engine aircraft, aerial photographs were collected using a Ziess Jena LMK 2000 camera loaded with KODAK AEROCHROME II Infrared Film 2443. To attain stereo viewing and full aerial coverage, parameters were set to collect aerial photos with a 60% forward-lap and a 30% side-lap. The 1:8,000-scale photographs were collected at an elevation above ground level of 4,000 ft. --- The photo mission required five flight lines to cover the Yellow River Unit, and another two flight lines to cover the Sny Magill Unit. In all, 69 aerial photos were collected on October 9, 2000 (57 photos for the Yellow River Unit, 12 photos for the Sny Magill Unit). HAS Images, Inc. (Dayton, Ohio) processed the original 9 x 9-inch positive transparency film, and produced two sets of contact prints. --- An earlier set of CIR aerial photos was collected by the UMESC on August 25, 2000 (1:15,000-scale) to capture peak vegetation biomass, which became particularly useful for mapping early senescing macrophytic wetland vegetation. This August photo set compliments the October set, which was collected to capture peak fall leaf phenology for forest mapping.</othercit>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>8000</srcscale>         <typesrc>photographic transparency and print</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <sngdate>               <caldate>20001009</caldate>               <time>unknown</time>             </sngdate>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>EFMO October 2000 CIR Aerial Photographs (UMESC 2000a)</srccitea>         <srccontr>Aerial images used for field work, photo interpretation, and subsequent map automation.</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey, Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, 2630 Fanta Reed Road, La Crosse, Wisconsin 54603</origin>             <pubdate>20000825</pubdate>             <title>Aerial Photographs (August) of Effigy Mounds National Monument</title>             <geoform>aerial photograph</geoform>             <serinfo>               <sername>USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program</sername>               <issue>Effigy Mounds NM Vegetation Mapping Project</issue>             </serinfo>             <pubinfo>               <pubplace>Denver, Colorado</pubplace>               <publish>U.S. Geological Survey, Center for Biological Informatics</publish>             </pubinfo>             <othercit>The August 2000 aerial photograph set of Effigy Mounds National Monument and environs was collected to compliment the October 2000 aerial photo set, which was used to produce the vegetation spatial database coverages for the Effigy Mounds National Monument Vegetation Mapping Project, USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. The October photos captured peak fall leaf phenology for forest mapping. The August photos, however, captured peak vegetation biomass, which became particularly useful for mapping early senescing macrophytic wetland vegetation. --- The U.S. Geological Survey Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) of La Crosse, Wisconsin collected the aerial photographs in conjunction with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Region 3 of Ft. Snelling, Minnesota. This effort was a side mission to another UMESC photo mission of the Mississippi River. Mounted in a USFWS Partenavia twin-engine aircraft, aerial photographs were collected using a Ziess Jena LMK 2000 camera loaded with KODAK AEROCHROME II Infrared Film 2443. To attain stereo viewing and full aerial coverage, parameters were set to collect aerial photos with a 60% forward-lap and a 30% side-lap. The 1:15,000-scale photographs were collected at an elevation above ground level of 7,500 ft. --- The photo mission required four flight lines to cover the Yellow River Unit, and one flight line to cover the Sny Magill Unit. In all, 28 aerial photos were collected on August 25, 2000 (24 photos for the Yellow River Unit, 4 photos for the Sny Magill Unit). HAS Images, Inc. (Dayton, Ohio) processed the original 9 x 9-inch positive transparency film, and produced one set of contact prints.</othercit>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>15000</srcscale>         <typesrc>photographic transparency and print</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <sngdate>               <caldate>20000825</caldate>               <time>Unknown</time>             </sngdate>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>EFMO August 2000 CIR Aerial Photographs (UMESC 2000b)</srccitea>         <srccontr>Aerial photographs used to interpret vegetation senesced or obscured by shadow on the October 9, 2000 aerial photographs.</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>             <pubdate>1994</pubdate>             <title>USGS 3.75-minute Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles of Effigy Mounds National Monument</title>             <geoform>digital orthophoto quadrangle</geoform>             <serinfo>               <sername>U.S. Geological Survey Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle Program</sername>               <issue>3.75-minute</issue>             </serinfo>             <pubinfo>               <pubplace>Menlo Park, California</pubplace>               <publish>U.S. Geological Survey, Earth Science Information Center</publish>             </pubinfo>             <othercit>USGS digital orthophoto quadrangles are black &amp; white (gray-scale) orthorectified images derived from aerial photographs.

These cooperators discussed the project's objectives and methods, receive assignments, and become acquainted with EFMO's landscape. EFMO staff became informed of the USGS-NPS VMP, and mapping and ecology teams learned about the EFMO's management and science issues. A preliminary schedule with assigned tasks was developed and a project boundary was established.</procdesc>         <procdate>2001</procdate>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>FIELD RECONNAISSANCE &amp; MAP CLASSIFICATION: --- Prior to photointerpretation, field reconnaissance was performed by the photointerpretation team to learn, test, and verify photo signatures and to establish a map classification. Ecologists intermittently assisted to assure correct field calls and to verify additional vegetation types as they were encountered. --- The day after the aerial photographs were collected (October 10, 2001), mapping and ecology staff visited EFMO to observe leaf phenology as close as possible to the date of photography. Digital pictures and notes were collected, and compared to the aerial photographs upon arrival. --- The first a field reconnaissance with aerial photos in hand occurred in July 2001. This field effort was combined with plant community validation, providing a first glance at how vegetation types appear on the aerial photographs. --- Field reconnaissance of aerial photos continued in October 2001, providing mappers with similar vegetation conditions of the fall season as when the photos were collected in the same month just one year earlier. Mappers became familiar with the vegetation and local ecology, and gained a further understanding on how to map vegetation types. Map classification representing vegetation types and land use were developed along with map conventions to promote mapping consistency. Throughout the project, the map classification and conventions were adjusted occasionally, reflecting knowledge of the vegetation and landscape at those given times.

The August 2000 1:15,000-scale CIR photos were used as an aid in mapping the October set (e.g., with early-senescing plants) and to map a section the October set did not cover (an area added to the map effort post photo mission). In all, 61 photos received photointerpretation data, 60 from the October set, and 1 photo from the August set. --- The film transparency photos were covered with clear acetate overlays. These overlays were registered to the photos by the fiducials and photo identification information. Photos were viewed for interpretation using a light table and Topcon M-3 mirror stereoscope with 3X and 6X binoculars. Each photo was paired up with the adjacent photo to view the images 3-dimensiaonally. To minimize edge distortion, interpretation was focused towards the center of each photograph. Ground features were delineated into polygons on the acetate overlays using Rapidograph ink pens. Each polygon received a map class code and any applicable physiognomic modifier codes. --- Standard photo signature characteristics were applied by mappers in their photointerpretation, including texture, color, pattern, and position in the landscape. Larger polygons were normally delineated first, then smaller polygons down to the MMU of 0.25 ha (0.62 acres) and, for specific classes, to 0.1 ha (0.25 acres). Application of the MMU during mapping tended to err below the guideline rather than above given the nonrectified aerial photos have inherent in them angle distortions and slight scale changes from high ridges to valley bottoms. --- In April 2002, field validation of the photointerpreted work was engaged to test the photointerpretation and application of the map classification. This field effort resulted in minimal adjustments to the photointerpreted work. The photointerpreted data was reviewed for quality assurance, and then advanced onto map automation.</procdesc>         <srcused>EFMO October 2000 CIR Aerial Photographs (UMESC 2000a)</srcused>         <srcused>EFMO August 2000 CIR Aerial Photographs (UMESC 2000b)</srcused>         <srcused>EFMO Map Classification (UMESC 2005a)</srcused>         <procdate>2002</procdate>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>MAP AUTOMATION &amp; SPATIAL DATABASE DEVELOPMENT: --- The photointerpreted data were converted into a GIS-usable format using three fundamental processes; (1) geo-reference, (2) digitize, and (3) database enhancement. The resulting map products are two ArcInfo coverages (the Yellow River Unit and environs and the Sny Magill Unit and environs), each projected in UTM, Zone 15, using NAD83. --- The interpreted overlays were geo-referenced using OrthoMapper (Image Processing Software Inc., Madison, Wisconsin), a softcopy photogrammetric software for GIS. OrthoMapper is a computer program designed to create orthophotographs from scanned and unrectified photographs. The software features a method of visual orientation involving a point-and-click operation using existing geo-referenced horizontal and vertical base maps. OrthoMapper also has the capability to geo-reference photo interpreted overlays, which is of primary importance to us. Interpreted overlays are geo-referenced using the orthophotographs produced from the OrthoMapper software. First, each aerial photograph was scanned at 400 dots per inch (dpi) and 64 million colors, producing a series of Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. Then OrthoMapper was used to register each image establishing both horizontal and vertical coordinates. USGS 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quadrangle (DOQ) images were used to derive the horizontal coordinates of the aerial photo image. USGS 7.5-minute digital elevation model (DEM) grids were used to derive the vertical coordinates of the aerial photo image. Once orthophotos were made, each overlay of photointerpreted data was scanned at a resolution of 100 dpi and black and white, again producing a series of TIFF images. Again Orthomapper was used to register each overlay image, this time to their corresponding orthophoto just produced. Finally, the geo-referenced overlay images were mosaicked into workable groups (e.g., 15?20 overlays) for subsequent digitizing (3 groups for the Yellow River Unit and one for Sny Magill Unit). --- To produce digitized polygon vector coverages for use in GIS, the raster-based image mosaics of geo-referenced overlays containing the photointerpreted data were converted into a grid format using ArcInfo (Version 8.0.2, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California). In ArcTools, the ArcScan utility was used to trace the polygon data and produce ArcInfo vector-based coverages. Map attributes were digitally assigned codes (both map classes and physiognomic modifiers) to the polygons, and the digital data were checked against the photointerpreted overlays for line and attribute consistency. Lastly, the three Yellow River Unit coverages were merged. Ultimately, two seamless vegetation map coverages were generated (the Yellow River Unit and environs and the Sny Magill Unit and environs). --- At this stage, the map coverages have mere map attribute codes assigned to each polygon. To assign a set of meaningful information to the map coverages (e.g., as map class names, physiognomic definitions, link to NVCS level types), an attribute table containing this information was joined to each map coverage. (For map attribute items, see the Entity and Attribute section in this metadata report.) The attribute tables were produced in spreadsheet format (dBASE IV), which was then converted to an ArcInfo table, and finally joined to the spatial database coverage's table using the MAP_ATT item as the common attribute item. ArcInfo in ArcGIS (9.0) was used to produce the ArcInfo Export and Spatial Data Transfer Standard files of the map coverages.</procdesc>         <srcused>EFMO October 2000 CIR Aerial Photographs (UMESC 2000a)</srcused>         <srcused>EFMO August 2000 CIR Aerial Photographs (UMESC 2000b)</srcused>         <srcused>EFMO USGS 3.75-minute DOQ (USGS 1994)</srcused>         <srcused>EFMO USGS 7.5-minute DEM (USGS 2001)</srcused>         <srcused>NVCS Floristic Classes (NatureServe 2003a)</srcused>         <srcused>NVCS Physiognomic Classes (FGDC 1997)</srcused>         <srcused>EFMO Ecological Systems (NatureServe 2003b)</srcused>         <srcused>USGS LUC (1976)</srcused>         <procdate>2002-2004</procdate>         <srcprod>EFMO Vegetation Map Coverages (UMESC 2005b)</srcprod>       </procstep>     </lineage>   </dataqual>   <spdoinfo>     <indspref>Located in northeastern Iowa in Allamakee and Clayton counties, EFMO is adjacent to the Mississippi River in a topographically unique area known as the Paleozoic Plateau region.
