The events fall under two broad categories: (1) turmoil initiated by members of the general populace and directed either against the government or against other persons or groups within the society, and (2) coercion and conciliation initiated by officeholders and directed toward other members or branches of the government. A subset of events in both categories is designated as minority group tensions. Variables include the legal status of the nation, type of event, type of group, issues involved, event's location, duration of event, number of participants, amount of violence, number of people arrested, injured, or killed, and the level of repressive force. A summary scale was developed to indicate the intensity of the event.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1955\" cycle=\"P1\">1955</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1964\" cycle=\"P1\">1964</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                        <dataKind>event/transaction data</dataKind>               <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A total of about 35,000 political events worldwide in    the period 1955-1964.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) THE NEW YORK TIMES, (2) THE NEW YORK TIMES    INDEX, and (3) FACTS 0N FILE             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
