Congo Abstract: Volcanoes are well known as an impressive large natural source of trace elements into the troposphere. Etna (Italy) and Nyiragongo (D.R. Congo) are two stratovolcanoes located in different geological settings, both characterized by persistent passive degassing from their summit craters. Here, we present some results on trace element composition in volcanic plume emissions, atmospheric bulk deposition (rainwater) and their uptake by the surrounding vegetation, with the aim to compare and identify differences and similarities between these two volcanoes. Volcanic emissions were sampled by using active filter-packs for acid gases (sulfur and halogens) and specific teflon filters for particulates (major and trace elements). The environmental impact of the volcanogenic deposition in the area surrounding of the crater rims was investigated by using different sampling techniques: bulk rain collectors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd gauges were used to collect atmospheric bulk deposition, and biomonitoring was carried out to collect gases and particulates by using endemic plant species. The estimates of the trace element fluxes confirm that Etna and Nyiragongo are large sources of metals into the atmosphere, especially considering their persistent state of passive degassing. The large amount of emitted trace elements is clearly reflected on the chemical composition of rainwater collected at the summit areas both for Etna and Nyiragongo. Moreover, the biomonitoring results highlight that bioaccumulation of trace elements is extremely high in the proximity of the crater rim and decreases with the distance from the active craters.</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9321\">     <title>Convivere con i rischi naturali</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9321</link>     <description>Title: Convivere con i rischi naturali Authors: Peppoloni, S.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione AC, Roma, Italia Abstract: I fenomeni naturali, anche nei loro aspetti pi\\ufffd\\ufffd temibili, ci ricordano che la Terra \\ufffd\\ufffd un pianeta vivo.

DiSTeM, Italy Editors: Fiore, S.; University of Bari, Italy Abstract: Volcanic emissions represent one of the most relevant natural sources of trace elements to the troposphere. Due to their potential toxicity they may have important environmental impacts from the local to the global scale and they can severely affect the atmospheric and terrestrial environment also at timescales ranging from a few to million years. Etna volcano is known as one of the largest global contributors of magmatic gases (CO2, SO2, and halogens) and particulate matter, including some toxic trace elements. The aim of this study was to characterize the chemical composition and the mineralogical features of the volcanogenic aerosol passively emitted from Mt. Etna. Nine samples were collected by using the filtration technique at different sites on summer 2010 and 2011. Chemical and mineralogical analyses allowed to discriminate two main constituents: the first is mainly referable to the silicate component in the volcanic plume, like lithic and juvenile fragments, crystals (e.g., plagioclases, pyroxenes, oxides) and shards of volcanic glass; the second one is linked to the soluble components like sulfosalts or halide minerals (sulfates, chlorides and fluorides). These investigations are especially important in the study area because the summit of Mt. Etna is yearly visited by nearly one hundred thousand tourists that are exposed to potentially harmful compounds.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9270\">     <title>The use of moss-bags technique for volcanic aerosols investigation on Mt.

DiSTeM, Italy Editors: Fiore, S.; University of Bari, Italy Abstract: Explosive eruptions and volcanic passive degassing inject large quantities of gas and particles into the atmosphere that are ultimately deposited at the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds surface through wet or dry deposition processes, affecting the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and the biosphere. Mount Etna (Italy) is one of the most prodigious and persistent sources of gases and particles to the troposphere. Volcanic emissions were studied at Etna volcano by using moss-bags technique. Mosses (Sphagnum species) were exposed around the volcano at different distances from the active vents to evaluate the impact of its emissions into the atmosphere and in the local surrounding. The results confirmed the huge amount of silicates, sulfates and halides compounds emitted into the atmosphere from Mount Etna. X-ray microanalysis showed that chemical composition of the particles is mostly defined by silicate (from pure silica to metal-rich silicate composition) and sulfate/halide compounds. The contents of major and trace elements in the Sphagnum moss-bags significantly increased after their exposure to volcanic emissions, confirming mosses as efficient accumulators. Metals uptake rate rapidly decreases with the distance from the volcanic emission vents. The elements that showed the greatest accumulation after exposition were S, Na, Fe, Al, Cu, V, As, Cd, Li, Se, Sc, Th, Bi and Tl. This study confirmed the marked environmental impact of volcanic emissions in the eastern sector of Etna, leading to an intense \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgeochemical anomaly\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of volatile major and trace elements due to the fumigation by the volcanic plume, in agreement with passive biomonitoring studies reported by previous authors. Finally, moss-bags techniques provide a cheap and efficient method to investigate quantitatively in space and time the environmental impact of volcanogenic atmospheric deposition.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9194\">     <title>Development of a portable active long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy system for volcanic gas measurements</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9194</link>     <description>Title: Development of a portable active long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy system for volcanic gas measurements Authors: Vita, F.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Kern, C.; U.S. Geological Survey, Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1300 SE Cardinal Ct S100, Vancouver, Washington 98683, USA; Inguaggiato, S.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia Abstract: Active long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) has been an effective tool&#xD; for measuring atmospheric trace gases for several decades. However, instruments were large, heavy and powerinefficient,&#xD; making their application to remote environments extremely challenging. Recent developments in&#xD; fibre-coupling telescope technology and the availability of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-LEDS) have&#xD; now allowed us to design and construct a lightweight, portable, low-power LP-DOAS instrument for use at remote&#xD; locations and specifically for measuring degassing from active volcanic systems. The LP-DOAS was used&#xD; to measure sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from La Fossa crater, Vulcano, Italy, where column densities of up&#xD; to 1.2 1018 molec cm\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2 ( 500 ppmm) were detected along open paths of up to 400m in total length. The&#xD; instrument\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds SO2 detection limit was determined to be 2 1016 molec cm\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2 ( 8 ppmm), thereby making quantitative&#xD; detection of even trace amounts of SO2 possible. The instrument is capable of measuring other volcanic&#xD; volatile species as well. Though the spectral evaluation of the recorded data showed that chlorine monoxide&#xD; (ClO) and carbon disulfide (CS2/ were both below the instrument\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds detection limits during the experiment, the&#xD; upper limits for the X/ SO2 ratio (XDClO, CS2/ could be derived, and yielded 2 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3 and 0.1, respectively.&#xD; The robust design and versatility of the instrument make it a promising tool for monitoring of volcanic degassing&#xD; and understanding processes in a range of volcanic systems.</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9181\">     <title>Characterization of the Etna volcanic emissions through an active biomonitoring technique (moss-bags): Part 2 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Morphological and mineralogical features</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9181</link>     <description>Title: Characterization of the Etna volcanic emissions through an active biomonitoring technique (moss-bags): Part 2 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Morphological and mineralogical features Authors: Calabrese, S.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dipartimento DiSTeM, Italy; D'Alessandro, W.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia Abstract: Volcanic emissions were studied at Mount Etna (Italy) by using moss-bags technique. Mosses were exposed around the volcano at different distances from the active vents to evaluate the impact of volcanic emissions in the atmosphere. Morphology and mineralogy of volcanic particulate intercepted by mosses were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Particles emitted during passive degassing activity from the two active vents, Bocca Nuova and North East Crater (BNC and NEC), were identified as silicates, sulfates and halide compounds. In addition to volcanic particles, we found evidences also of geogenic, anthropogenic and marine spray input. The study has shown the robustness of this active biomonitoring technique to collect particles, very useful in active volcanic areas characterized by continuous degassing and often not easily accessible to apply conventional sampling techniques.</description>     <dc:date>2014-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9172\">     <title>Characterization of the Etna volcanic emissions through an active biomonitoring technique (moss-bags): Part 1 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Major and trace element composition</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9172</link>     <description>Title: Characterization of the Etna volcanic emissions through an active biomonitoring technique (moss-bags): Part 1 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Major and trace element composition Authors: Calabrese, S.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dipartimento DiSTeM, Italy; D'Alessandro, W.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Bellomo, S.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Brusca, L.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Martin, R.S.; Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, UK; Saiano, F.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dipartimento SAF, Italy; Parello, F.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dipartimento DiSTeM, Italy Abstract: Active biomonitoring using moss-bags was applied to an active volcanic environment for the first time. Bioaccumulation originating from atmospheric deposition was evaluated by exposing mixtures of washed and air-dried mosses (Sphagnum species) at 24 sites on Mt. Etna volcano (Italy). Concentrations of major and a large suite of trace elements were analysed by inductively coupled mass and optical spectrometry (ICP-MS and ICP-OES) after total acid digestion. Of the 49 elements analysed those which closely reflect summit volcanic emissions were S, Tl, Bi, Se, Cd, As, Cu, B, Na, Fe, Al. Enrichment factors and cluster analysis allowed clear distinction between volcanogenic, geogenic and anthropogenic inputs that affect the local atmospheric deposition. This study demonstrates that active biomonitoring with moss-bags is a suitable and robust technique for implementing inexpensive monitoring in scarcely accessible and harsh volcanic environments, giving time-averaged quantitative results of the local exposure to volcanic emissions. This task is especially important in the study area because the summit area of Mt. Etna is visited by nearly one hundred thousand tourists each year who are exposed to potentially harmful volcanic emissions.</description>     <dc:date>2014-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9142\">     <title>Methanotrophic activity and diversity of methanotrophs in volcanic geothermal soils at Pantelleria (Italy)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9142</link>     <description>Title: Methanotrophic activity and diversity of methanotrophs in volcanic geothermal soils at Pantelleria (Italy) Authors: Gagliano, A.

STEBICEF; Parello, F.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dip. DiSTeM; Quatrini, P.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dip. STEBICEF Abstract: Volcanic and geothermal systems emit endogenous gases by widespread degassing from soils, including CH4, a greenhouse gas twenty-five times as potent as CO2. Recently, it has been demonstrated that volcanic or geothermal soils are not only a source of methane, but are also sites of methanotrophic activity. Methanotrophs are able to consume 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd40 Tg of CH4 a\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 and to trap more than 50% of the methane degassing through the soils. We report on methane microbial oxidation in the geothermally most active site of Pantelleria (Italy), Favara Grande, whose total methane emission was previously estimated at about 2.5Mga\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 (t a\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1). Laboratory incubation experiments with three top-soil samples from Favara Grande indicated methane consumption values of up to 59.2 nmol g\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 soil d.w. h\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1. One of the three sites, FAV2, where the highest oxidation rate was detected, was further analysed on a vertical soil profile, the maximum methane consumption was measured in the topsoil layer, and values greater than 6.23 nmol g\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 h\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 were still detected up to a depth of 13 cm. The highest consumption rate was measured at 37  C, but a still detectable consumption at 80  C (&gt;1.25 nmol g\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 h\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1) was recorded. The soil total DNA extracted from the three samples was probed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using standard proteobacterial primers and newly designed verrucomicrobial primers, targeting the unique methane monooxygenase gene pmoA; the presence of methanotrophs was detected at sites FAV2 and FAV3, but not at FAV1, where harsher chemical\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdphysical conditions and negligible methane oxidation were detected. The pmoA gene libraries from the most active site (FAV2) pointed to a high diversity of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs, distantly related to Methylocaldum-Metylococcus genera, and the presence of the newly discovered acido-thermophilic Verrucomicrobia methanotrophs. Alphaproteobacteria of the genus Methylocystis were isolated from enrichment cultures under a methane-containing atmosphere at 37  C. The isolates grow at a pH range of 3.5 to 8 and temperatures of 18\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd45  C, and consume 160 nmol of CH4 h\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 mL\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1 of culture. Soils from Favara Grande showed the largest diversity of methanotrophic bacteria detected until now in a geothermal soil. While methanotrophic Verrucomicrobia are reported as dominating highly acidic geothermal sites, our results suggest that slightly acidic soils, in high-enthalpy geothermal systems, host a more diverse group of both culturable and uncultivated methanotrophs.</description>     <dc:date>2014-10-21T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9007\">     <title>The Ancient Gates to Hell and Their Relevance to Geogenic CO2</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9007</link>     <description>Title: The Ancient Gates to Hell and Their Relevance to Geogenic CO2 Authors: Pfanz, H.; University of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Essen, Essen, Germany; Y\\ufffd\\ufffdce, G.; Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey; D'Andria, F.; University of Salento, Italy; D'Alessandro, W.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Pfanz, B.; Ruhr-University, Bochum, Germany; Manetas, Y.; University of Patras, Greece; Papatheodorou, G.; University of Patras, Greece Editors: Wexler, P.; National Library of Medicine Abstract: No abstract</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8995\">     <title>Active moss monitoring allows to identify and track distribution of metal(loid)s emitted from fumaroles on Vulcano Island, Italy</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8995</link>     <description>Title: Active moss monitoring allows to identify and track distribution of metal(loid)s emitted from fumaroles on Vulcano Island, Italy Authors: Arndt, J.; University of Bayreuth, Germany; Calabrese, S.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd di Palermo, Dipartimento DiSTeM; D'Alessandro, W.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Planer-Friedrich, B.; University of Bayreuth, Germany Abstract: Volatile metal(loid)s are known to be emitted from volcanoes worldwide.We tested the suitability of active moss&#xD; monitoring for tracking volatilemetal(loid)s released fromthe fumarolic field on Vulcano Island, Italy, and differentiated&#xD; fumaroles from other sources of gaseous and particulate trace elements such as sea spray and soil.Metal(loid)&#xD; accumulation on the mosses per day did depend neither on the state of the exposed moss (dead or living) nor&#xD; exposure time (3, 6, or 9 weeks). After collection, mosses were digested with either HNO3/H2O2 or deionized&#xD; water and analyzed by ICP-MS.While for most elements both extraction methods yielded similar concentrations,&#xD; higher concentrations were observed e.g. for Pb in the stronger HNO3/H2O2 extracts, indicating the presence of&#xD; particles, which were not digested and removed by filtration in deionized water extracts. Due to their ubiquitous&#xD; detection in comparable concentrations at all 23 moss monitoring stations all over the island, Li, Mg and Sr were&#xD; attributed to sea spray origin. Iron, Co, W, V, Pb, Cr, Mo, and Ba occurred predominantly at the crater, where the&#xD; soil was not covered by vegetation, and thus likely represent soil-borne particulate transport. Arsenic, Sb, S, Se, Tl,&#xD; Bi, and I showed a clear concentration maximum within the fumarolic field. Concentrations gradually decreased&#xD; along a transect in wind direction fromthe fumaroles, which confirms their volcanic origin. Activemossmonitoring&#xD; thus proved to be an inexpensive and easy-to-apply tool for investigations of volcanic metal(loid) emissions and&#xD; distributions enabling differentiation of trapped elements by their source of origin.</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
