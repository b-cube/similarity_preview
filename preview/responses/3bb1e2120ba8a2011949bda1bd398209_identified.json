Specifically, integrating those methods to build mode-locked fiber lasers that are more robust and with high performances. We show that an adaptive genetic algorithm is successful in increasing pulse energies in a multi-nonlinear polarization rotation(NPR) fiber laser system and in achieving locally optimal performance. In order to maintain the local optimal performance under birefringence perturbations, we designed an extremum seeking controller(ESC). By numerical simulations of a single-NPR fiber laser, it is showed that the ESC tracks local optimal mode-locking states despite significant distur- bances to parameters. We also developed a toroidal search and a machine learning algorithm that enables us to obtain a global optimal performance when birefringence of laser cavity varies. In addition, we also demonstrated an adaptive time-stepping method for dimension reduction computation which can be used to accelerate numerical simulations for partial differential equations. Overall, these methods are all data-driven and do not rely upon un- derlying models and hence can be generalized to use in other non-optical complex systems as well in the future.

The reconfigurable holographic metamaterial antenna is an attractive new technology for satellite communications, particularly in mobile applications. This antenna is thin, light-weight, consumes little power to operate, and is inexpensive to manufacture. Yet, perhaps its most promising attribute is software-controlled beam steering - this antenna does not require moving parts and is still able to receive or transmit data without interruption to a moving, non-geosynchronous satellite (for example, a satellite in low Earth orbit, medium Earth orbit, or highly elliptic orbit), from a moving platform (for example, a plane, ship, or automobile), or both. However, the antenna cannot achieve continuous, high performance operation without robust, adaptive optimal pattern synthesis. Yet, as the antenna hardware is new and under development, so also has the adaptive software control aspect not been developed. This thesis derives and demonstrates an effective adaptive control approach to manage and improve the beam pattern of the reconfigurable holographic metamaterial antenna (RHMA) continuously during operation when deployed. This approach is developed in three steps. First, a computational model of the antenna that accurately predicts the antenna response is derived and validated to study the RHMA's behavior and experiment with synthesis of patterns.  Second, a pattern synthesis approach that cancels sidelobes that typically occur in the RHMA's radiation pattern is designed and proven effective both computationally and experimentally.  Finally, an adaptive controller is added to the pattern synthesis, which enables continuous automatic, robust control of the RHMA even in the presence of measurement error and changing environmental conditions. Altogether, the work in this thesis significantly advances the demonstrated capabilities of the RHMA. This thesis is the first work that not only theoretically explores pattern synthesis of the RHMA, but then designs and implements a viable adaptive controller for self-optimizing beam pattern control. The algorithmic infrastructure demonstrated in this work meets the dynamic operational requirements of the RHMA, and as an overall algorithmic package, the mathematical framework provides a robust, machine-intelligent architecture capable of enabling the RHMA technology.

FAS is a critical biomarker in several leading neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis, and others. They are also a hallmark feature of concussions and Traumatic Brain Injuries -- the leading cause of death among youngsters worldwide and a lightning rod issue in contact sports. In this work, we discuss how different shapes of FAS can affect neuronal signaling and degrade the information encoded in spike trains. We adapted theoretical estimates, derived in idealized axonal geometry settings, to real axons with much more challenging structures. Our methods highlight potential trouble spots of axonal morphology and provide a starting point for novel FAS diagnosis. Finally, we discuss the collective effects of FAS in neuronal networks, where stable response patterns are lost, jeopardizing the system's ability to transmit information. A better understanding of the macroscopic effects of FAS pathologies -- that occur at a cellular level-- can shine new light onto the cognitive, behavioral, perceptual and sensory-motor impairments resulting from such disorders.

Trichtchenko, Olga We analyze the stability of solutions to Euler's equations in the presence of surface tension. First we compute stationary solutions to periodic Euler's equations in a travelling frame of reference and then we analyze their spectral stability. Depending on the coefficient of surface tension, we see resonant effects in the solutions. This results in a myriad of instabilities for gravity-capillary waves. Since the theory for analyzing the stability of water waves is general to all Hamiltonian systems, we extend the results to other equations, mainly ones that are used to model water waves in different asymptotic regimes. We compare the stability results for the model equations to those we obtain for the full water wave system and comment on the applicability of these models.
