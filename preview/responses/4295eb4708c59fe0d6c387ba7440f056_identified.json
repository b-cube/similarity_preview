Segment based routing enables a scalable and simple method to monitor        data plane liveliness of the complete set of paths belonging to a single domain.    Compared with legacy MPLS ping and path trace, MPLS topology awareness     reduces management and control plane involvement of OAM measurements     while enabling new OAM features.</t>     </abstract>   </front>    <middle>      <section title=\"Introduction\">      <t>It is essential for a network operator to monitor all the forwarding paths       observed by the transported user packets. The monitoring flow     is expected to be forwarded in dataplane in a similar way as user packets. Segment Routing      enables forwarding of packets along pre-defined paths and segments and thus a      Segment Routed monitoring packet can stay in dataplane while passing along one      or more segments to be monitored.</t>      <t>This document describes illustrates use-cases based on data plane path     monitoring capabilities. The use case is limited to a single IGP MPLS domain.</t>       <t>The use case applies to monitoring of LDP LSP's as well as to      monitoring of Segment Routed LSP's.  As compared to LDP, Segment Routing       is expected to simplify the use case by enabling MPLS topology detection       based on IGP signaled segments as <xref target=\"ID.sr-isis\">specified by </xref>.  Thus a       centralised and MPLS topology aware monitoring unit can be realized in a       Segment Routed domain. This topology awareness can be used      for OAM purposes as described by this use case.  The MPLS path monitoring       system described by this document can be realised with pre-Segment based Routing (SR)      technology.  Making such a pre-SR MPLS monitoring system aware of a domains      complete MPLS topology requires e.g. management plane access.  To      avoid the use of stale MPLS label information, IGP must be monitored      and MPLS topology must be timely aligned with IGP topology.      Obviously, enhancing IGPs to exchange of MPLS topology information as done by SR      significantly simplifies and stabilises such an MPLS path monitoring system.  </t>       <t>This document adopts the terminology and framework described in <xref target=\"ID.sr-archi\"></xref>.       It further adopts the editorial simplification explained in section 1.2 of       the <xref target=\"ID.sr-use\">segment routing use-cases</xref>.</t>        <t>The use case offers several benefits for network monitoring.      A single centralized monitoring device is able to monitor the      complete set of a domains forwarding paths. Monitoring packets never leave      data plane.  MPLS  path trace function (whose specification and features       are not part of this use case) is required, if the actual data plane       of a router should be checked against its control plane. SR capabilities       allow to direct MPLS OAM packets from a centralized monitoring system to       any router within a domain whose path should be traced.</t>          <t>In addition to monitoring paths, problem localization is required.      Faults can be localized:</t>        <t><list style=\"symbols\">           <t>by IGP LSA analysis.</t>              <t>correlation between different SR based monitoring probes.</t>           <t>by any MPLS traceroute method (possibly in combination       with SR based path stacks).</t>         </list></t>       <t>Topology awareness is an essential part of link state IGPs. Adding     MPLS topology awareness to an IGP speaking device hence enables a     simple and scalable data plane based monitoring mechanism.</t>       <t>MPLS OAM offers flexible features to recognise an execute data paths of        an MPLS domain. By utilsing the ECMP related tool set offered e.g. by    <xref target=\"RFC4379\">RFC 4379</xref>, a segment based routing LSP     monitoring system may:</t>         <t><list style=\"symbols\">           <t>easily detect ECMP functionality and properties of paths at data level.</t>              <t>construct monitoring packets executing desired paths also if ECMP is present.</t>           <t>limit the MPLS label stack of an OAM packet to a minmum of 3 labels.</t>          </list></t>       <t>Alternatively, any path may be executed by building suitable label       stacks. This allows path execution without ECMP awareness.</t>       <t>The MPLS path monitoring system may be a any server residing      at a single interface of the domain to be monitored.  It doesn't have to   support any specialised protocol stack, it just should be capable of    understanding the topology and building the probe packet with the right    segment stack. As long as measurement packets return to this or another    interface connecting such a server, the MPLS monitoring servers are the    single entities pushing monitoring packet label stacks.  If the depth of    label stacks to be pushed by a PMS are of concern for a domain, a    dedicated server based path monitoring architecture allows limiting    monitoring related label stack pushes to these servers.  </t>         <t>First drafts discussing SR OAM requirements and         possible solutions to allow SR usage as described by this document         have been submitted already, see <xref target=\"ID.sr-4379ext\"></xref> and <xref target=\"ID.sr-oam_detect\"></xref>.</t>      </section>             <section title=\"An MPLS topology aware path monitoring system\">            <t>An MPLS path monitoring system (PMS) which is able to learn the IGP LSDB        (including the SID's) is able to execute arbitrary chains of label switched paths.     It can send pure monitoring packets along such a path chain or it can direct     suitable MPLS OAM packets to any node along a path segment. Segment Routing here     is used as a means of adding label stacks and hence transport to standard MPLS OAM     packets, which then detect correspondence of control and data plane of this (or any     other addressed) path. Any node connected to an SR domain is     MPLS topology aware (the node knows all related IP addresses, SR SIDs and MPLS labels).     Thus a PMS connected to an MPLS SR domain just needs to set up a topology data base     for monitoring purposes.     </t>        <t>Let us describe how the PMS constructs a labels stack to transport a packet to         LER i, monitor the path of it to LER j and then receive the packet back.</t>              <t> The PMS may do so by sending packets carrying the following MPLS label         stack infomation:</t>        <t><list style=\"symbols\">           <t>Top Label: a path from PMS to LER i This is expressed as Node SID of              LER i.</t>              <t>Next Label: the path that needs to be monitored from LER i to LER j.             If this path is a single physical interface (or a bundle of connected            interfaces), it can be expressed by the related AdjSID. If the shortest            path from LER i to LER j is supposed to be monitored, the Node-SID            (LER j) can be used. Another option is to insert a list of segments            expressing the desired path (hop by hop as an extreme case). If            LER i pushes a stack of Labels based on a SR policy decision and this            stack of LSPs is to be monitored, the PMS needs an interface to collect            the information enabling it to address this SR created path.</t>           <t>Next Label or address: the path back to the PMS. Likely, no further            segment/label is required here. Indeed, once the packet reaches LER j,            the 'steering' part of the solution is done and the probe just needs            to return to the PMS. This is best achieved by popping the MPLS stack            and revealing a probe packet with PMS as destination address (note            that in this case, the source and destination addresses could be the            same). If an IP address is applied, no SID/label has to be assigned      to the PMS (if it is a host/server residing in an IP subnet outside      the MPLS domain).</t>          </list></t>         <t>Note: if the PMS is an IP host not connected to the MPLS domain, the         PMS can send its probe with the list of SIDs/Labels onto a suitable         tunnel providing an MPLS access to a router which is part of the monitored         MPLS domain.</t>       </section>       <section title=\"SR based path monitoring use case illustration\">       <section title=\"Use-case 1 - LSP dataplane monitoring\">         <figure anchor=\"PMS_use_case_1\">            <preamble></preamble>            <artwork>                 +---+     +----+     +-----+                 |PMS|     |LSR1|-----|LER i|                  +---+     +----+     +-----+                    |      /      \\\\    /                    |     /        \\\\__/                   +-----+/           /|                  |LER m|           / |                  +-----+\\\\         /  \\\\                          \\\\       /    \\\\                           \\\\+----+     +-----+                            |LSR2|-----|LER j|                            +----+     +-----+            </artwork>            <postamble>Example of a PMS based LSP dataplane monitoring</postamble>        </figure>               <t>For the sake of simplicity, let's assume that all the nodes are         configured with the same <xref target=\"ID.sr-archi\">SRGB</xref>,          as described by section 1.2 of <xref target=\"ID.sr-use\"></xref>.</t>          <t>Let's assign the following Node SIDs to the nodes of the figure:          PMS = 10, LER i = 20, LER j = 30.</t>      <t>To be able to work with the smallest possible SR label stack, first       A suitable MPLS OAM method is used to detect the ECMP routed path between       LER i to LER j which is to be monitored (and the required address information       to direct a packet along it). Afterwards the PMS sets up and sends packets to       monitor availability of the detected path.  The PMS does this by creating       a measurement packet with the following label stack (top to bottom):       20 - 30 - 10. The packet will only reliably use the monitored path, if the       label and address information used in combination with the MPLS OAM method       of choice is identical to that of the monitoring packet.     </t>      <t>LER m forwards the packet received from the PMS to LSR1. Assuming         Pen-ultimate Hop Popping to be deployed, LSR1 pops the top label and         forwards the packet to LER i. There the top label has a value 30 and         LER i forwards it to LER j. This will be done transmitting the packet        via LSR1 or LSR2. The LSR will again pop the top label. LER j will         forward the packet now carrying the top label 10 to the PMS (and it         will pass a LSR and LER m).</t>        <t>A few observations on the example given in figure 1:</t>        <t><list style=\"symbols\">           <t>The path PMS to LER i must be available. This path must be detectable,     but it is usually sufficient to apply an SPF based path.</t>             <t>If ECMP is deployed, it may be desired to measure along both          possible paths which a packet may use between LER i and LER j. To do          so, the MPLS OAM mechanism chosen to detect ECMP must reveal the required           information (an example is a so called tree trace) between LER i and LER j.           This method of dealing with ECMP based load balancing paths requires the          smallest SR label stacks if monitoring of paths is applied          after the tree trace completion.         </t>           <t>The path LER j to PMS to must be available. This path must be     detectable, but it is usually sufficient to apply an SPF based path.</t>          </list></t>      <t>Once the MPLS paths (Node SIDs) and the required information to       deal with ECMP has been detected, the paths of LER i to LER j can       be monitored by the PMS.  Monitoring itself does not require MPLS       OAM functionality. All monitoring packets stay on dataplane, hence       path monitoring does no longer require control plane interaction in       any LER or LSR of the domain.  To ensure reliable results, the PMS      should be aware of any changes in IGP or MPLS topology.  Further      changes in ECMP functionality at LER i will impact results.  Either      the PMS should be notified of such changes or they should be limited      to planned maintenance.  After a topology change, a suitable MPLS       OAM mechanism may be useful to detect the impact of the change.     </t>      <t>Determining a path to be executed prior to a measurement may also be       done by setting up a label stack including all Node SIDs along that path (if       LSR1 has Node SID 40 in the example and it should be passed between       LER i and LER j, the label stack is 20 - 40 - 30 - 10). The advantage of    this method is, that it does not involve MPLS OAM functionality and it    is independent of ECMP functionalities. The method still is able to monitor    all link combinations of all paths of an MPLS domain. If correct forwarding    along the desired paths has to be checked, some suitable MPLS OAM mechanism may be    applied also in this case.</t>       <t>In theory at least, a single PMS is able to monitor data plane availability        of all LSPs in the domain. The PMS may be a router, but could also be        dedicated monitoring system. If measurement system reliability is an        issue, more than a single PMS may be connected to the MPLS domain.</t>       <t>Monitoring an MPLS domain by a PMS based on SR offers the option of        monitoring complete MPLS domains with little effort and very excellent       scalability. Data plane failure detection by circulating monitoring packets     can be executed at any time. The PMS further could be enabled to       send MPLS OAM packets with the label stacks and address information        identical to those of the monitoring packets to any node of the MPLS domain.         It does not require access to LSR/LER management interfaces or their        control plane to do so.</t>        </section>        <section title=\"Use-case 2 - Monitoring a remote bundle\">         <figure anchor=\"PMS_use_case_2\">            <preamble></preamble>            <artwork>              +---+    _   +--+                    +-------+             |   |   { }  |  |---991---L1---662---|       |             |PMS|--{   }-|R1|---992---L2---663---|R2 (72)|             |   |   {_}  |  |---993---L3---664---|       |             +---+        +--+                    +-------+         </artwork>            <postamble>SR based probing of all the links of a remote bundle</postamble>        </figure>         <t>R1 addresses Lx by the Adjacency SID 99x, while R2 addresses         Lx by the Adjacency SID 66(x+1).</t>             <t>In the above figure, the PMS needs to assess the dataplane availability          of all the links within a remote bundle connected to routers R1 and R2.</t>         <t>The monitoring system retrieves the SID/Label information from the IGP         LSDB and appends the following segment list/label stack: {72, 662, 992, 664}          on its IP probe (whose source and destination addresses are the address         of the PMS).</t>         <t>MS sends the probe to its connected router.

R1 forwards the probe          to R2 over link L2 (Adjacency SID 992). R2 forwards the probe to R1         over link L3 (Adjacency SID 664).

In the above example, the label stack top to bottom may be        as follows, when sent by the PMS:</t>          <t><list style=\"symbols\">           <t>Top: SR based Node-SID of LER i at LER m.</t>              <t>Next: LDP label identifying the path to LER j at LER i.</t>           <t>Bottom: SR based Node-SID identifying the path to the PMS at            LER j</t>          </list></t>       <t>While the mixed operation shown here still requires the PMS to be aware       of the LER LDP-MPLS topology, the PMS may learn the SR MPLS topology by        IGP and use this information.</t>      </section>      <section title=\"PMS monitoring of different Segment ID types\">              <t>MPLS SR topology awareness should allow the SID to monitor liveliness         of most types of SIDs (this may not be recommendable if a SID identifies        an inter domain interface). </t>        <t>To match control plane information with data plane information, MPLS OAM      functions as defined by e.g. RFC4379 should be enhanced to allow collection      of data relevant to check all relevant types of Segment IDs.</t>       </section>            <section title=\"Connectivity Verification using PMS\">              <t>While the PMS based use cases explained in Section 3 are sufficient to provide        continuity check between  LER i and LER j, it may not        help perform connectivity verification. So in some cases like data plane         programming corruption, it is possible that a transit node between LER i and LER j        erroneously removes the top segment ID and forwards a monitoring packet to the PMS     based on the bottom segment ID leading to a falsified path liveliness indication by the     PMS.       </t>              <t>There are various method to perform basic connectivity verification like         intermittely setting the TTL to 1 in bottom label so LER j selectively perform         connectivity verification. Other methods are possible and may be added when     requirements and solutions are specified.         </t>             </section>      <section title=\"Extensions of related standards helpful for this use case\">          <t>The following activities are welcome enhancements supporting this          use case, but they are not part of it:         </t>          <t>RFC4379 functions should be extended to support Flow- and Entropy Label      based ECMP.           </t>             </section>      <section anchor=\"IANA\" title=\"IANA Considerations\">       <t>This memo includes no request to IANA.</t>     </section>      <section anchor=\"Security\" title=\"Security Considerations\">       <t>As mentioned in the introduction, a PMS monitoring packet should never         leave the domain where it originated. It therefore should never use stale         MPLS or IGP routing information. Further, assigning different label ranges         for different purposes may be useful. A well known global service level         range may be excluded for utilisation within PMS measurement packets.         These ideas shouldn't start a discussion. They rather should point out,         that such a discussion is required when SR based OAM mechanisms like a         SR are standardised.        </t>      </section>            <section title=\"Acknowledgement\">     <t>The authors would like to thank Nobo Akiya for his contribution.</t>   </section>    </middle>    <!--  *****BACK MATTER ***** -->    <back>     <!-- References split into informative and normative -->      <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:      1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use \"ampersand character\"RFC2629; here (as shown)      2. simply use a PI \"less than character\"?rfc include=\"reference.RFC.2119.xml\"?> here         (for I-Ds: include=\"reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml\")       Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
