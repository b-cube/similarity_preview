Experiment carried out on the Cambridge Multi Pass Rheometer (MPR4) at a piston speed of 4.4 mm/s at 175C. The geometry generates a flow field with an extensional component at the centreline. If the no slip condition at a solid surface is satisfied, the side walls are high shear rate regions. The experiments were carried out to evaluate the material behaviour in extensional flow. At low extensional rates, an almost Newtonian stress profile is exhibited. Conditions: Material = HDPE CM1, Mw=104kg/mol, Mn=50.2kg/mol, Polydipersity=2.07, Temperature = 175 degrees celsius, Piston speed = 4.4mm/s, Width of flow channels = 1.5mm, depth of sample = 10mm (hence 2D flow approximation is possible), Back pressure in the side arms = 5bar.
