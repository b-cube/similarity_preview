More wind power means cheaper energy; hundreds of thousands of new jobs; public health improvements that can save more than 21,000 lives; and, climate benefits worth more than $400 billion in prevented damage and disaster. And get this: We can do it all at essentially no cost to consumers, the report says. (Electricity prices might increase by up to 1 percent by 2030, but decrease by 2 percent by 2050, the DOE finds.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of Congress: This report should be required reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without necessarily intending to, the report also shows that the now-expired Production Tax Credit for Wind Power and the also-expired Investment Tax Credit for the nascent offshore wind power industry are smart, cost-effective investments for all Americans. And that wind power can help states economically meet their commitments (and then some) under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants. Really, the bigger we go with wind power, the better off we are as a nation, &lt;i&gt;Wind Vision&lt;/i&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DOE has a history of significantly underestimating how much renewable energy we can successfully deploy, and that history repeats itself here. In fact, we can go much bigger than 35 percent with wind. And we should, for a host of reasons, not the least of which is it can help us prevent significant climate disasters. Still, even at this relatively low, 35-percent level, the benefits of wind power, described below, are pretty staggering:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Jobs, jobs, jobs:&lt;/b&gt; 600,000 of them, in fact. Especially good news from &lt;i&gt;Wind Vision&lt;/i&gt;: Many of these jobs can buttress the nation's currently floundering manufacturing sector, creating good jobs for people who often have only high school degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Energy savings galore:&lt;/b&gt; The more wind power and, thus, less natural gas we use to generate electricity, the lower the price of natural gas overall. The result: a cumulative, $280 billion in energy savings due to decreased natural gas demand. Those saving add 2.3 cents in value to each kilowatt hour of wind power we generate. (Funny, that's the cost of the PTC.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Easier breathing:&lt;/b&gt; When wind power displaces dirty power from the grid, it significantly cuts the pollution that pours out of power-plant smokestacks. The 35 percent target will prevent not only 21,700 premature deaths. It will avert more than 10,000 asthma-induced emergency room visits and means asthmatic kids will attend almost 2.5 million more days of school. Overall, the public health benefits are valued at 0.9 cents per kilowatt hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Rural development:&lt;/b&gt; Wind power helps keep rural communities intact by supporting land owners, and paying for vital public services like schools, police and fire protection. Getting 35 percent of the nation's electricity from the wind can mean $1 billion in annual land lease payments to land owners and more than $3 billion in annual property tax payments in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Water, water, everywhere:&lt;/b&gt; Generating electricity in conventional and nuclear power plants eats up huge amounts of the country's increasingly scarce water resources. (In fact, the power sector uses 6 percent of total U.S. water and is responsible for a full 41 percent of fresh water withdrawals.) Wind power doesn't need water, meaning we can cut the power sector's use of water by 23 percent and reduce fresh water withdrawals by 15 percent overall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;A happier climate:&lt;/b&gt; With wind power at 35 percent, we can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 12.3 gigatonnes by 2050. Those benefits are worth $400 billion in savings from fewer extreme weather events and disasters. And they boost the value of wind power by 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DOE &lt;i&gt;Wind Vision&lt;/i&gt; report demonstrates all the benefits of deploying lots of pollution-free wind power. Federal support, like the PTC, more than pays for itself several times over. That's good news; Congress should take note.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=DyjHtjnybeQ:VD9e1EqjMic:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=DyjHtjnybeQ:VD9e1EqjMic:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=DyjHtjnybeQ:VD9e1EqjMic:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/DyjHtjnybeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/35_percent_wind_no_problem_lot.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Arctic on Notice:  A Barge Adrift at Sea and Spill Modeling by the World Wildlife Fund Show the Extreme Risks of an Arctic Ocean Oil Spill</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/_-vdiUjrIOY/arctic_on_notice_a_barge_adrif.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/jaxelrod//473.18154</id>         <published>2015-03-18T19:20:38Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-18T18:20:18Z</updated>                  <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Joshua Axelrod, Policy Analyst &ndash; Canada Project, Washington, D.C.:                  This week, news of the fate of an unmanned barge set adrift in Canada's Beaufort Sea in October finally resurfaced.

Where had it gotten to after breaking from its tow north of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories? It turns out that after being stuck in the ice over winter, the barge is now off the Russian coast, having &lt;a href=\"http://www.adn.com/article/20150316/supply-barge-adrift-arctic-months\"&gt;drifted nearly 1,400 miles in just five months&lt;/a&gt;. That distance is remarkable. As Canada's National Energy Board (NEB) &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/cclusen/the_final_frontier_canadas_nat.html\"&gt;considers undisclosed and untested offshore oil and gas well safety measures&lt;/a&gt; proposed for operations in the Canada's Beaufort Sea, the potential fate and impact of an under ice oil spill in the Beaufort Sea remains a serious open question with a growing body of evidence pointing to a truly troubling answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last fall, World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF) provided a first glimpse of just how problematic a late-season oil spill in the Beaufort Sea could be. In &lt;a href=\"http://arcticspills.wwf.ca/#home/\"&gt;a major report modeling the impacts of an oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in Arctic waters, WWF and its partner &lt;a href=\"http://www.asascience.com/\"&gt;RPS Applied Science Associates&lt;/a&gt;, considered the likely behavior and impact of four different types of spills in the Beaufort Sea: tanker, pipeline, shallow water, and deep water. Under each scenario analyzed, oil is expected to spread across significant swaths of the Arctic Ocean. In the worst cases, &lt;a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/r-arctic-oil-well-blowout-could-spread-more-than-1000-km-wwf-study-2014-25\"&gt;spilled oil could travel more than 1,000 kilometers&lt;/a&gt; from its source with the potential for impacts to shorelines and waters in Canada, the U.S. and Russia. This week's news makes clear that 1,000km was only a conservative estimate of just how far spilled oil from these proposed operations could go. It also highlights once again that deep water oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters creates unnecessary environmental risks that could decimate an entire region's ecosystem along with the traditions and livelihoods of its indigenous population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/Spill%20Model.png\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Spill Model.png\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/assets_c/2015/03/Spill%20Model-thumb-500xauto-18983.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surface oiling predicted by RPS ASA under a late season, deep water blowout scenario.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A short history of exploration with no payoff and limited success&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the Beaufort Sea remained ice covered for most of the year, making offshore resource development nearly impossible. &lt;a href=\"http://www.beaufortrea.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NCR-5358624-v4-BREA_-_FINAL_UPDATE_-_EXPLORATION_AND_ACTIVITY_FORECAST-__MAY_2013.pdf\"&gt;In the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing through the late 1980s, numerous exploratory wells were drilled in shallow waters in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Though oil was discovered, high costs, extreme operating conditions, declining oil prices, and discovery of only small, \"widely scattered reserves,\" led to a decline in industry interest. The short era of exploration ended for good in 1990 when the newly created Environmental Impact Review Board found that the Government of Canada and Gulf Oil, with its proposed Kulluk drilling program, were unprepared for a major oil spill event in the Beaufort Sea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/Molikpaq%20Rig.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Molikpaq Rig.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/assets_c/2015/03/Molikpaq%20Rig-thumb-350x240-18985.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"240\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molikpaq drilling vessel in Canada's Beaufort Sea, circa 1984.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Though ice in the Beaufort Sea has continued to recede as climate change accelerates, the challenges and risks faced by the offshore oil and gas industry remain. The Beaufort Sea is now ice free for a month or two each year, but it is completely ice covered for eight. At the same time, memories of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/us/26spill.html?pagewanted=all\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;recent offshore drilling disasters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, falling world oil prices, and increased international attention on activities that are driving climate change make renewed exploration as risky and unnecessary as it was in the 1970s and 80s. The problems with offshore oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters have been encapsulated by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/04/140404-coast-guard-blames-shell-in-kulluk-rig-accident/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Shell's disastrous experience in the U.S. Chukchi and Beaufort Seas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; where accidents and challenging conditions have led to massive capital spending and constant delays. Indeed, as the U.S. contemplates leasing new exploration rights in the U.S. Beaufort Sea, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Oil-companies-cooling-on-Arctic-drilling-rights-5658254.php\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;more than 50% of current U.S. exploration leases are being relinquished by the oil industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, marking a mass exodus of interest in Arctic offshore exploration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, in an apparent search for the Holy Grail of frontier oil reserves, today's Canadian operators are now looking to move farther offshore into deeper, more treacherous waters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Open vs. icy waters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;RPS ASA's modeling of potential Beaufort Sea oil spills illuminates an interesting reality: the risks and impacts posed by an oil spill in the Beaufort Sea change depending on whether the spill takes place in open water vs. icy water. Though one might assume that open water conditions would lead to fewer impacts, the truth is the opposite and more complex. As highlighted in WWF's report, any spill from a deep water operation (the type currently being proposed by industry and reviewed by the NEB) will likely lead to major harmful environmental impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;For an open water spill early in the drilling season (i.e., the type of spill where the most tools for remediation are available and operating conditions are the most ideal), the report finds \"a high probability that shorelines along the U.S. coast of the North Slope and Point Barrow would become moderately to heavily oiled.\" In ice covered waters, or in waters where ice is beginning to form, impacts to shorelines are lessened due to the presence of landfast ice. However, longer response times and entrapment of oil in ice lead to massive dispersion of oil throughout the Arctic Ocean along with the risk of contamination from toxic dissolved aromatics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Impacts to the marine environment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;With the potential for the massive spread of oil throughout the Arctic region comes the potential for significant environmental impacts. Under the four key scenarios modeled for a deep water well failure, RPS ASA's models show shoreline oiling ranging from 300-1,800 kilometers in length, with the most oiling occurring following an early season blowout. This means that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://arcticspills.wwf.ca/#scenario/dw-wcd/dw-wcd-d/time/734113/layers/iba/polarbear/ringedseal/beardedseal/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;critical habitat of numerous Arctic species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, including polar bear, migratory birds, ringed seals, and bearded seals would be directly impacted. Further, because oil would be expected to disperse widely below the surface, a blowout could lead to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://arcticspills.wwf.ca/#scenario/dw-wcd/dw-wcd-s-wc/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;major impacts to iconic marine species such a bowhead and beluga whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, as well as the numerous species of fish upon which indigenous communities depend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/Bowhead.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bowhead.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/assets_c/2015/03/Bowhead-thumb-500xauto-18987.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"236\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bowhead whale populations are dependent on the Beaufort Sea for survival and play a central role in indigenous whale hunting traditions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unacceptable Risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Media outlets were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/28/arctic-drilling\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;quick to pick up on RPS ASA's and WWF's work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;. No doubt this is because the results laid bare an essential truth about resource development in Arctic offshore areas: it is accompanied by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/wwf-report-highlights-drilling-risks-to-beaufort-sea/article19781124/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;extraordinary risk for widespread ecological destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;. And this destruction is not limited to Canadian waters.

As customers save energy in their homes and businesses, fossil-fuel fired power plants are called upon less and emit less pollution. But some power plant owners complain that a Clean Power Plan target that relies on reductions achieved through actions outside power plants' boundaries, like saving energy in buildings and factories, would be unachievable (see &lt;a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0602-23423\"&gt;Comments of Class of '85 Regulatory Response Group&lt;/a&gt; at 43-44). They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbon pollution credits from energy efficiency will be accessible to power plant owners, regardless of a state's regulatory model. Buying it may not yet be as easy as one-click ordering on Amazon, but even now, before the Clean Power Plan is in place, energy efficiency is evolving into a \"product\" that power plant owners can purchase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;All types of energy efficiency \"products\" share some key features:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A definition of what types of projects are eligible to generate credits, like a requirement that projects go beyond business-as-usual or standard market practices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Requirements for estimating savings from the projects,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Back-up provisions for what happens if those planned energy savings do not occur.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;I categorize these energy efficiency products by how the price of energy efficiency - the amount a power plant owner pays to the energy saver - is set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed price&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;In this approach, power plant owners would make an offer to buy a quantity of energy efficiency credits for a set price, businesses would respond with projects, and the power plant owner would then buy credits for energy savings up to their budget constraint. There's ample precedent for this: every utility-run energy efficiency portfolio I know of has a program where customers with big projects receive a set incentive per-unit of energy savings. For example, Commonwealth Edison in Illinois currently &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.comed.com/business-savings/programs-incentives/Pages/custom-projects.aspx\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; incentives of 7 cents per-kWh of energy savings for eligible projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competitive solicitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this approach, power plant owners would issue a competitive solicitation for energy efficiency credits, and businesses would respond with energy saving projects they can complete at a price they determine. &lt;a href=\"https://www.sce.com/wps/portal/home/procurement/solicitation/lcr/!ut/p/b1/rVRNb6MwEP0r9IDUHogHzIfZG21RQjZKtqVVC5fIGIewSzAxpGn665dkWVWVNqHVxifP6M3zzPPToBg9o7ikL3lGm1yUtNjHsT0fB7eePjSNYHat--CFAbn1Rz6EM7sFRC0AjhwPTtZ_x-gJxShmZVM1SxTVjM-ZKBteNnNeqtDdVeAll9lOqaRgG8lXh1wtipzlzaHTWoVCMFoojFa0Te4Uydeb_A-0Vi4LJq_2D1UsT1GEKTaNlCWalVigmTojmosXWHOpTU3XxYlu6N1gJzrvEeYw2HHIzcTuADoZeqMghACciQvB9Y97331wMXFwB3CH4I_GMwiGD3cYAnwH09DzMMBfhhPqj1GcFSI5_GTklQkmGYolX3DJ5WAj2_Syaar6mwoqbLfbQSZEVvABEysV_lWyFHWDnj8iUdRK5RzV4sZC4bv2POWunQLRHMc2NNNJqeaC6WgWsQ2eWjbBPOkhDOHchMaXCcd9vm61y3-u17HXunvv4tdWtv-xdwepGyFpxpVLXl_1TGV-mOpTnu8htM5N6HyZcPyJfXRW3fvXSrV6XBG8037dj94m_EmjCQFsVS9vk8V02kVFdnHxG_4JBog!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\"&gt;Southern California Edison&lt;/a&gt; recently applied this strategy to make up for lost capacity when the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station closed. They issued a Request for Offers for energy saving projects that would reduce system stress in two areas of its service territory most affected by the power plant's closure. The utility selected energy efficiency projects from three vendors, totaling 130 MW of load reduction due to the energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Another example of a program that uses competitive solicitations is Consolidated Edison's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.coned.com/energyefficiency/targetedDSM.asp\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Targeted DSM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; program, which the utility operates in its New York City and Westchester County service territory. It is called a \"targeted\" program because ConEd seeks load reductions in specific areas during specific hours, to defer or avoid specific transmission and distribution system investments. The utility determines the price it will accept for these load reductions by analyzing the costs it would avoid if it deferred the specific investment, and then issues a request for proposals to energy efficiency businesses. The program is described in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/2059.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; 2010 ACEEE Summer Study paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Auction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third strategy, the utility or generator conducts an auction where businesses compete to provide energy savings for a set incentive, essentially asking the question: what energy saving projects would you do for a $10,000 incentive. This is a new approach, pioneered by AEP-Ohio. AEP has hired &lt;a href=\"http://www.overlayconsulting.com/\"&gt;Overlay Consulting&lt;/a&gt; to run the auctions. Pre-qualified customers and efficiency service providers bid on incentives on a $/kWh saved basis, and incentives are granted to the lowest priced bids. AEP has to-date run three auctions and paid $19.15 million in incentives. The most recent auction, in October 2014, yielded energy savings at an average incentive of 2.5 cents per-kWh of savings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Or hire a company in the energy efficiency program industry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A power plant owner could also hire one of the companies in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.aesp.org/\"&gt;energy efficiency program industry&lt;/a&gt;, and have this company deal with customers, service providers, retailers, etc. When required by a consent decree to undertake an environmental mitigation project, wholesale generation provider American Municipal Power &lt;a href=\"https://www.veic.org/media-room/news/2010/06/15/VEIC_To_Create_EFFICIENCY_SMART_POWER_PLANT_For_American_Municipal_Power_Members_In_Six_States.aspx\"&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"https://www.veic.org/\"&gt;Vermont Energy Investment Corporation&lt;/a&gt; - one of the nation's best energy efficiency program administrators - to run a portfolio of energy efficiency programs for its member utilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;The takeaway: generators have ample tools to reduce emissions by helping customers save energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=IEZ7JsUcFMs:ihlhdz9kw38:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=IEZ7JsUcFMs:ihlhdz9kw38:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=IEZ7JsUcFMs:ihlhdz9kw38:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/IEZ7JsUcFMs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/yes_power_plant_owners_can_red.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">NRDC Urges the New York Legislature to Support Our Ocean and Great Lakes</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/LRwvAB8HCsk/nrdc_urges_the_new_york_legisl.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/achase//197.18147</id>         <published>2015-03-18T14:00:00Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-18T13:59:07Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Ali Chase, Policy Analyst, New York:                  Once hunted to scarcity, endangered humpback whales have been making a comeback in New York waters.

Rarely seen in recent decades, the cetaceans have been delighting whale watchers in the New York Bight for the last several years, with a &lt;a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2014-12-humpback-whales-nyc.html\"&gt;high of 87 sightings in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Humpbacks and other whales have &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/wildlife/marine/nywhales/nywhales.asp\"&gt;also been recorded singing&lt;/a&gt; near New York harbor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;No one knows precisely why New York's waters are now hopping with migrating humpbacks, but we hope it is due in part to the state's efforts to protect and improve the ocean resources on which New York's citizens depend. A critical tool for this work has been New York State's Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). Traditionally financed through the Real Estate Transfer Tax (RETT), the EPF supports important research and restoration work aimed at protecting the environment and the communities that rely on its natural wealth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;That's why, today, NRDC staffers are also being spotted in migration - heading to Albany with our ocean coalition partners to encourage the state legislature to increase funding to restore and protect New York's ocean and Great Lakes assets. We're hoping to see the fiscal year 2015-2016 budget include an increase in the overall EPF to $200 million, paid for by the RETT, and in the ocean and Great Lakes line from the Governor's proposed $6.05 M toward $10 M.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;EPF funding will help ensure that the proposed actions included in the draft &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/fish_marine_pdf/oceanactionplan.pdf\"&gt;New York Ocean Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; become reality. The draft OAP identifies more than 60 actions and associated steps the state should accomplish over the next decade to address current challenges in our waters, and proactively prepare for future ocean uses. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation is accepting comments on the draft plan &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/84428.html\"&gt;until March 30&lt;/a&gt;, but it's safe to say that without continued funding very little of the plan will advance. This includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Projects to monitor whale and sea turtle populations offshore so that we can better understand the migration routes these species take and help protect them;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Efforts to reduce waste in fisheries by determining ways to mitigate \"bycatch\" - the unintended catch brought up and thrown back, dead and dying; and,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Development of a baseline ocean monitoring system to build on existing ocean observations, and track other numbers, such as ocean pH and other indicators of changes in ocean chemistry in areas--such as shellfish-growing regions--deemed ecologically and economically important to the state.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;In many cases, only &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/100471.html\"&gt;part of this work is funded&lt;/a&gt; - if at all. New EPF dollars will make the difference in whether or not these projects happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;New York has made great strides to improve the health of its ocean and Great Lakes, but our marine life continues to struggle in the face of pollution, loss of productive habitat, and challenges like ocean acidification. More than 75 percent of the nation's commercial fish and an even greater percentage of its recreational fish catch spend part of their lives in estuary waters, yet &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/66532.html\"&gt;more than 45 percent of New York's estuary waters are impaired&lt;/a&gt;. New York is also &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/oceans/acidification/state-vulnerability.asp\"&gt;one of the most vulnerable states to ocean acidification&lt;/a&gt;, due to its economic dependence on shellfish harvesting and its high levels of nitrogen pollution, which amplify ocean acidification's impacts. Our waters are busier than ever, with new uses like wind energy proposed and increased shipping likely from the Panama Canal expansion. We need the legislature to support ocean improvements so that the resources we rely on for food, jobs and recreation remain healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;In 2012, ocean sector industries like fishing and tourism &lt;a href=\"http://www.coast.noaa.gov/quickreport/#/ENOW/ENOW/36000/2012\"&gt;contributed more than $22 billion&lt;/a&gt; to New York's gross domestic product and supported more than 313,000 jobs. Increased ocean and Great Lakes funding will enhance this economic value. It will also protect sensitive marine and Great Lake habitats, and wildlife like our beloved whales. That's the song NRDC will be singing in Albany this week, and we hope the legislature hears us.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=LRwvAB8HCsk:_C3-mUDQaJk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=LRwvAB8HCsk:_C3-mUDQaJk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=LRwvAB8HCsk:_C3-mUDQaJk:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/LRwvAB8HCsk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/achase/nrdc_urges_the_new_york_legisl.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Energy efficiency and renewables: the cheapest, smartest way for states to cut carbon pollution</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/sVwBMMucuGA/energy_efficiency_and_renewabl.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/sclefkowitz//90.18153</id>         <published>2015-03-18T13:21:31Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-18T13:24:41Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, Director of Programs, Washington, D.C.:                  States will have a lot of flexibility in crafting plans to cut carbon pollution from power plants.

So &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ddoniger/why_states_arent_rushing_to_ju.html\"&gt;despite the recent call from Senator McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, states should \"just say yes\" to moving ahead with plans to cut carbon pollution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Climate-related disasters in 2012 alone cost American taxpayers more than $100 billion. We see the effects of climate change throughout our country in violent storms, floods and droughts. It is past time to have strong limits on carbon pollution from fossil-fuel-burning power plants - the nation's biggest source of the pollution that drives climate change. And that is what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is doing with its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/clean-power-plan-benefits.asp\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, which will establish the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from the electricity sector. Nationwide, the plan as proposed would cut power sector carbon pollution 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 30 percent by 2030, and usher in climate and health benefits &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ddoniger/epas_plan_to_curb_carbon_pollu.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;worth an estimated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; $55 to $93 billion annually in 2030, far outweighing the annual compliance costs of $7-9 billion to put the new plans in place. NRDC has shown how EPA can achieve even greater reductions for substantially the same costs as EPA's plan, and even greater climate and health benefits in the final standards coming this summer. When EPA finalizes those standards, each state will have the flexibility and opportunity to design a plan to cut dirty carbon pollution that best fits the needs of its people and resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Every state generates electricity from a unique mix of resources, which is why EPA designed so much flexibility into the Clean Power Plan. Each state has the opportunity to craft its own approach to cut carbon pollution. And the best methods by far when it comes to reducing pollution, protecting our health, and creating new jobs come from renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;The good news is that NRDC's new state-by-state analyses show that many states are already on a good path to meet their targets, and can go even further to reap the economic and health benefits through increased investment in clean energy. The analysis for states from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/privera/cutting_carbon_pollution_flori.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lmartinez/while_state_officials_fight_it.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/spring_cleaning_in_the_keyston.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/cutting_carbon_pollution_can_d.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; shows that these states are already on the path to reduce their carbon emissions. For them and many other states, putting a strong plan in place will mean building on their strengths through investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Energy efficiency is the least expensive way for states to meet their pollution reduction targets under the new standards. The demonstrated growth rates of the top 10 states show that smart policies or implementation plans can help states to remove existing market barriers and deploy this low-cost resource. With technological and other advances, wind and solar power costs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/energy-environment/solar-and-wind-energy-start-to-win-on-price-vs-conventional-fuels.html?_r=0\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;are declining rapidly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, becoming competitive with the costs of fossil fuel plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;The NRDC analyses highlight a range of policy approaches that states can employ in their plans to cut carbon pollution. For example, states can choose to set standards that achieve a specific pollution rate (lbs CO2/MWh), or that meet a total pollution target (total tons of CO2). Either approach can work well to help a state craft a custom-made, innovative and effective set of solutions to cut carbon pollution. And the NRDC analyses also highlight the advantages of cooperative, multi-state approaches to help a state achieve even better results in areas such as consumer savings, reduced compliance costs, increased flexibility and reliability, and avoided electricity market distortions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;With the reality of climate change being felt across America and the world, now is the time to tackle carbon pollution to help protect our country and show the kind of leadership that will galvanize global action. With American ingenuity at work, we can harness the energy we need from efficiency and renewable sources such as the wind and the sun. And, as is often the case in America, states are in the lead in creating flexible and innovative plans to take us into the clean power future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=sVwBMMucuGA:iH820CdcXLM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=sVwBMMucuGA:iH820CdcXLM:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=sVwBMMucuGA:iH820CdcXLM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/sVwBMMucuGA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/sclefkowitz/energy_efficiency_and_renewabl.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Cutting Carbon Pollution Can Drive Montana's Economy While Improving Health</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/eWyMWyGCyF8/cutting_carbon_pollution_can_d.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/dsullivan//203.18150</id>         <published>2015-03-17T21:42:00Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T21:44:42Z</updated>                <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Dylan Sullivan, Staff Scientist, San Francisco:                  This blog was guest-written by NRDC Fellow Amanda Levin A new factsheet released by the NRDC today highlights the huge economic and health benefits of clean energy for Montana.

Investments in clean energy have and will continue to create new jobs, expand the economy, reduce pollution, lower electricity bills, and improve public and environmental health across the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One way for Montana to build on its clean energy potential is through the U.S. EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan to reduce harmful pollution from power plants, which account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions. States will have great flexibility in complying with their emissions limits and can design a plan that accounts for each state's unique economic situation and needs. Investing in energy efficiency and renewable wind and solar power should be a fundamental part of Montana's strategy, as a new NRDC fact sheet issued today shows. Ramping up energy efficiency and renewable energy investments &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/state-benefits.asp\"&gt;can create&lt;/a&gt; more than 274,000 new jobs across the U.S. while saving American households and businesses over $37.4 billion on their electric bills in 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both emissions-free renewable energy and energy efficiency programs are low-cost options for Montana to reduce pollution while building its economy. Wind and solar energy are now cost-competitive with more traditional fossil-fuel energy nationally. And Montana has some of the best wind and solar resources in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tapping into Montana's Natural Resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider that as recently as 2005, the state had no installed wind energy production. But just last year, Montana &lt;a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_17_b\"&gt;generated enough wind&lt;/a&gt; energy to power 200,000 households for an entire year. That's enough electricity to keep the lights on for close to half of the state's households. Meanwhile, Montana's wind generation has more than doubled&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the last five years, alone, and is still rapidly growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/Montana_Wind.png\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Montana_Wind.png\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/assets_c/2015/03/Montana_Wind-thumb-500xauto-18977.png\" width=\"474\" height=\"361\" class=\"mt-image-left\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Renewable energy has been a smart choice for Montanans. Wind energy is one of the lowest cost resources in the portfolio of NorthWestern Energy, which provides electricity to two-thirds of the state. In addition, wind installations &lt;a href=\"http://www.rnp.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/montana%20wind%20power%20factsheet%2012Mar6.pdf\"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Brought over $1.3 billion in new investment to the state,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Created over 1,300 high-paying construction jobs and several dozen permanent jobs,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Contributed over $8 million in tax revenue annually, and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paid rural landowners $2 million annually in &lt;a href=\"http://awea.files.cms-plus.com/FileDownloads/pdfs/Montana.pdf\"&gt;land lease payments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Montana also has a small, but rapidly growing, number of solar installations. In fact, rooftop solar installations have grown by almost 330% in the last five years - with a 200% change between 2011 and 2012 alone. The open farmland and high-energy needs of Montana's farms are ideal for solar energy and can provide farmers with significant economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter energy use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is another effective way to reduce emissions while growing the economy because smarter energy use lessens the need to generate electricity from fossil fuel-fired power plants that pollute our air and harm our health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And helping people optimize their energy use through such programs as weatherization or rebates for highly efficient appliances costs far less than building new power plants, and is often even cheaper than operating existing power plants. Some of Montana's utilities already run energy efficiency programs. Over five years, NorthWestern Energy's program resulted in a &lt;a href=\"http://psc.mt.gov/Docs/ElectronicDocuments/pdfFiles/D2012-5-49IN13032261352TE.PDF\"&gt;net benefit of $78 million&lt;/a&gt; in reduced utility bills for its customers. For every dollar spent on the programs, customers received $3.70 in benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By just &lt;i&gt;maintaining&lt;/i&gt; utility energy efficiency program spending and savings at current levels between 2017 and 2030, the state &lt;a href=\"https://governor.mt.gov/Portals/16/docs/111dwhitepaperpathways91914-final.pdf\"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that Montanans would save $650 million on their bills and create an additional 375 jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And &lt;i&gt;expanding &lt;/i&gt;energy efficiency investments to achieve twice as much energy efficiency savings as Montana currently does would result in even greater economic benefits, with additional customer bill savings of over $1 billion and the creation of another 530 jobs possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The future is now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Montana's energy future rests in its hands. The Clean Power Plan will let Montana chart a path toward pollution reduction. A smart, effective, and forward-looking state plan to meet Montana's emissions targets will reduce market barriers to - and create new incentives for - clean energy development. The Clean Power Plan is an opportunity for the Treasure State to grow its economy and more fully develop its renewable natural resources in order to create the foundation for a Montana for future generations to call home.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=eWyMWyGCyF8:xmPBzlFH7Sk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=eWyMWyGCyF8:xmPBzlFH7Sk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=eWyMWyGCyF8:xmPBzlFH7Sk:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/eWyMWyGCyF8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/cutting_carbon_pollution_can_d.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Spring cleaning in the Keystone State: How the Clean Power Plan provides a roadmap for more jobs and cleaner air for Pennsylvania</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/WamzHgCHauQ/spring_cleaning_in_the_keyston.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/jmorris//448.18151</id>         <published>2015-03-17T21:28:12Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T21:55:59Z</updated>                <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Jackson Morris, Director, Eastern Energy, Danville, Pa.:                  This blog was co-written by my colleague, NRDC Fellow Amanda Levin Springtime has finally arrived in Pennsylvania.

And with the snow finally melted, the birds getting rowdy, and the smell of the trees waking up at last in the air, it's a perfect time to take a fresh look at the clean energy opportunity currently before decision-makers in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/clean-power-plan-state-options-PA.pdf\"&gt;A new factsheet&lt;/a&gt; NRDC released today highlights the huge economic and health benefits of clean energy for Pennsylvania, and provides a helpful guide to the state's compliance options under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from fossil-fueled power plants. State policies have already helped create a burgeoning clean energy economy here in our state. And Pennsylvania has a substantial opportunity to expand and build on its clean energy achievements, while simultaneously meeting (and even exceeding) its EPA emissions reduction target. Increased investments in clean energy will create new jobs, expand the economy, reduce pollution, lower electric bills, and improve public and environmental health across the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Opportunity &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power plants account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions. Under the approach proposed by EPA under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, states have been afforded great flexibility in complying with these limits. This flexibility empowers states to design plans that take into account each state's unique economic situation and needs, as well as the ability to pursue a regional, multi-state approach to cutting carbon pollution. As a net exporter of energy, Pennsylvania can see significant benefits from such multi-state approach: In fact, &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/syeh/pjm_regional_cooperation_leads.html\"&gt;a recent study by our regional grid operator, PJM&lt;/a&gt;, (and this helpful &lt;a href=\"http://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedFiles/Publishing/Articles/Electric_System_Reliability_and_EPAs_Clean_Power_Plan_Case_of_PJM.pdf\"&gt;Analysis Group summary&lt;/a&gt; of that study) show that a mass-based, regional approach would be the most cost-effective and flexible option for the region. Indeed, a regional approach would be about &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/syeh/pjm_regional_cooperation_leads.html\"&gt;30 percent cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than a patchwork of individual state plans, and would allow Pennsylvania to continue to export power while working with other states to reduce pollution. Or even more simply put by my friend David Weiskopf of NextGen Climate America: &lt;a href=\"http://nextgenamerica.org/epa-rule/keep-it-clean-and-cooperate-new-pjm-report-shows-how-states-can-maximize-benefits-while-cutting-carbon/\"&gt;keep it clean and cooperate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/5647126425_edc716fd25_z.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"5647126425_edc716fd25_z.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/assets_c/2015/03/5647126425_edc716fd25_z-thumb-500xauto-18981.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energy efficiency measures, like the evaporative cooling system on this Grantville farm, can help Pennsylvania create new jobs and cost-effectively comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from existing power plants. (photo: &lt;span&gt;Lance Cheung for the &lt;/span&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the precise mechanics Pennsylvania ultimately decides to pursue, spurring investment in energy efficiency and renewable wind and solar power should be a central component of the state's plan, as the new NRDC fact sheet issued today shows. Based on NRDC modeling, ramping up energy efficiency and renewable energy would drive the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/cps-state-benefits-PA.pdf\"&gt;creation of 5,100 new Pennsylvania jobs&lt;/a&gt;, and save residents and businesses an estimated $456 million on their electric bills in 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter energy use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is an effective way to reduce pollution while growing the economy because smarter energy use lessens the need to generate electricity from fossil fuel-fired power plants that pollute our air and thus harm our health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency investments create good-paying jobs in manufacturing, construction, and energy auditing and installations. In fact, Pennsylvania already has more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Series/Clean%20Economy/42.PDF\"&gt;118,000 clean energy jobs&lt;/a&gt;, a majority in energy efficiency. With expected future investments in clean energy, this sector is set to expand. Energy efficiency investments have already delivered marked economic and environmental benefits to the state, and now have the added value of being able to play a key part in smart Clean Power Plan compliance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helping people optimize their energy use through programs such as weatherization or rebates for highly efficient appliances costs far less than building new power plants, and is often even cheaper than operating existing ones. Under Pennsylvania's energy efficiency standard, Act 129, the state's utilities run programs to cut energy waste in homes and businesses. These programs have already &lt;a href=\"http://pfenergycenter.blogspot.com/2014/02/debrief-on-act-129-hearing-in-pa-house.html\"&gt;produced significant energy and bill savings&lt;/a&gt;. PECO customers have saved roughly $331 million and PPL customers have saved at least $428 million over the first 6 years of these programs. In total, the state's residents and business have saved more than $4.2 billion in energy costs. For every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency, customers received almost $3 in energy benefits alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency programs are low-cost and drive huge benefits to consumers, and Pennsylvania still has vast untapped, low-cost energy efficiency opportunities just waiting to be tapped. In fact, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.puc.pa.gov/electric/pdf/Act129/Act129-PA_Market_Potential_Study051012.pdf\"&gt;state's own analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Pennsylvania could cost-effectively cut another 27 percent of expected future energy use over the next 10 years with only currently available and cost-effective technology. Boosting the state's energy efficiency programs is an easy and cheap way to grow the economy, reduce pollution under the Clean Power Plan, and protect public health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pennsylvania's Renewable Energy Potential&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy is another low-cost option for Pennsylvania to reduce pollution while strengthening our economy. The state already has more than 1,340 megawatts of wind power installed--enough to power more than 1.3 million homes. Wind generation in the state has almost doubled over the last five years and has grown a staggering 1,150 percent in the last 10 years. These &lt;a href=\"http://awea.files.cms-plus.com/FileDownloads/pdfs/Pennsylvania.pdf\"&gt;wind installations&lt;/a&gt; have:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;brought more than $2.7 billion in new capital into the state;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;supported as many as 2,000 jobs; and,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;provided rural communities with more than $4 million annually through land-lease payments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solar power has also become a profitable industry in our state. Pennsylvania is home to more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/pennsylvania\"&gt;470 solar companies&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 2,300 employees, making the state one of the largest solar employers in the nation. In addition, &lt;a href=\"http://pre.thesolarfoundation.org/solarstates/Pennsylvania\"&gt;more than 33,000 Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; homes now have solar, placing the state 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation for household solar installations. In 2013 alone, the solar industry invested more than $144 million in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The future is now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Clean Power Plan empowers our state to chart a path forward that can make it a national leader in cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable energy, all while cutting the dangerous carbon pollution that is wrecking our climate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crafting a plan that maxes out energy efficiency and renewable energy (like wind and solar) will save consumers money on their bills, create jobs, and spur the local economy. The Clean Power Plan is an opportunity for the Keystone State to create the foundation for a Pennsylvania that future generations will want to call home. So, by all means, let's roll up our sleeves and give the state's energy mix a proper spring cleaning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=WamzHgCHauQ:sy6FGuO7GfM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=WamzHgCHauQ:sy6FGuO7GfM:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=WamzHgCHauQ:sy6FGuO7GfM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/WamzHgCHauQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/spring_cleaning_in_the_keyston.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Clean Power Plan is a Manageable Challenge </title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/MYqMm-8HGPY/clean_power_plan_is_a_manageab.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/czichella//287.18149</id>         <published>2015-03-17T20:08:03Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T20:14:08Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Carl Zichella, Director of Western Energy Transmission, San Francisco:                  Much has been made of the recent North American Electricity Reliability Council (NERC) catalog of challenges states face in complying with the EPA's Clean Power Plan emission reduction requirements.

Over the last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has held a series of workshops to explore the matter further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To listen to many critics, meaningfully reducing CO2 emissions from the electricity sector is a nearly impossible task and an untenable reliability risk. But is it really? Haven't we learned anything from integrating large amounts of renewable power into the nation's grid? Is compliance so terribly hard?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, no, it isn't, according to a number of recent (and not so recent) studies that have shown that transforming the electricity system form dirty fossil generation to zero-pollution renewables not only can be done reliably, it &lt;i&gt;is already being done &lt;/i&gt;in many parts of the country. The managers of some of the largest parts of the U.S. grid believe it is manageable, and though they may advocate tinkering with the timelines a bit, believe that the task is not all that formidable. Other analyses maintain that delays are not even needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the recent National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) meeting in Washington DC, Michael Kormos, executive vice president of the PJM Interconnection, operating the high-voltage grid between New Jersey and Illinois, the nation's largest electricity market, said. \"Given enough time ... we don't necessarily foresee a reliability problem.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/1FwK9y3\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the highly respected Analysis Group that said that PJM, the largest competitive wholesale electricity market region in the U.S., touching 13 states and the District of Columbia, should not be overly challenged in complying with the Clean Power Plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;\"&lt;i&gt;PJM is well positioned to lower carbon pollution from existing power plants while relying on the reliability tools and operating procedures it uses with great success. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;\" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;In other words, PJM is already doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;In a February &lt;a href=\"http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/news/790\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on reliability and the Clean Power Plan, the Brattle Group agreed, concluding:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\"Following a review of the reliability concerns raised and the options for mitigating them, we find that compliance with the CPP is unlikely to materially affect reliability. The combination of the ongoing transformation of the power sector, the steps already taken by system operators, the large and expanding set of technological and operational tools available and the flexibility under the CPP are likely sufficient to ensure that compliance will not come at the cost of reliability.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;The American Wind Energy Association and the Solar Energy Industry Association have jointly released a &lt;a href=\"http://awea.files.cms-plus.com/FileDownloads/pdfs/Handbook%20for%20States%20final.pdf\"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for states to consider when crafting compliance plans that highlighted the strategies already known and available that allow for compliance with the Clean Power Plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some, like the &lt;a href=\"http://www.wiresgroup.com\"&gt;WIRES&lt;/a&gt; organization and &lt;a href=\"http://cleanenergytransmission.org/\"&gt;Americans for a Clean Energy Grid&lt;/a&gt; (ACEG), are advocating that transmission be emphasized as a compliance strategy as either part of EPA's &lt;a href=\"http://cleanenergytransmission.org/americans-for-a-clean-energy-grid-calls-for-epa-to-recognize-the-value-of-high-voltage-transmission-in-clean-power-plan/\"&gt;third \"building block&lt;/a&gt; (ACEG)\" or as a separate &lt;a href=\"http://www.wiresgroup.com/docs/filings/WIRES%20Comments%20FERC%20Presentation%20on%20CPP.pdf\"&gt;fourth building block&lt;/a&gt; (WIRES). No matter how you slice it, the right transmission can cost-effectively unlock access to low-cost renewables, greatly aiding multi-state compliance strategies. It takes time to build transmission though, so planning for it is essential. WIRES, NRDC, ACEG and many others are advocating that FERC ensure that transmission for Clean Power Plan compliance be prioritized as \"needed\" to meet public policy goals in the agency's \"Order 1000\" regional planning process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the rhetoric that the Clean Power Plan presents some sort of unprecedentedly complex morass of red tape, my former colleague David Weiskopf has insightfully &lt;a href=\"http://nextgenamerica.org/author/dweiskopf/\"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; that the Clean Power Plan presents regulators with a fairly simple and familiar set of tools with which to attack the carbon pollution problem. Tools they already know and use, and which make the grid more, not less reliable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons the Clean Power Plan is a manifestly manageable challenge:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility ensures reliability. &lt;/b&gt;Because of its flexible design, the Clean Power Plan ensures electric grid reliability.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Clean Power Plan is more flexible than any prior clean air rules, providing many compliance options to maintain reliability. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;States have the tools to keep \"reliability must-run\" plants running. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Clean Power Plan encourages states to use either rate-based or mass-based approaches, under which averaging and trading of credits or allowances allows flexibility for plants to run if needed to address a local reliability concern (such as a new plant construction delay), while maintaining the overall emission reductions of the program.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;FERC's role in ensuring reliability. &lt;/b&gt;FERC can play an extremely valuable role in helping power sector stakeholders understand the interplay between the Clean Power Plan's flexible design and grid planning and operational procedures to assure reliability. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;FERC and EPA responsibilities. &lt;/b&gt;Throughout the Plan's implementation process, FERC and EPA should follow their well-established, complementary roles: FERC (and the grid planners it regulates) reviews the reliability aspects of the Plan, while EPA, with input from FERC, approves or adjusts state plans on reliability or other grounds.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=MYqMm-8HGPY:tONo_8LQJRI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

That's the drama that is playing out right now off the south shore of Long Island. There, Liberty Natural Gas, a developer, wants to site a proposed offshore, liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal, in the same area as a proposed offshore wind project that has the potential to supply our area with clean wind power. NRDC, like other stakeholders, elected officials and ordinary citizens, submitted &lt;a href=\"http://docs.nrdc.org/energy/files/ene_15031701a.pdf\"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; yesterday and were joined by &lt;a href=\"http://www.riverkeeper.org\"&gt;Riverkeeper&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http://www.sierraclub.org\"&gt;Sierra Club&lt;/a&gt; in opposing the LNG terminal. We urge the two federal agencies charged with approving the project permit--the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) and the U.S. Coast Guard--to deny the Port Ambrose LNG terminal once and for all. Moreover, New York State and New Jersey should use their authority to veto the project, should the two federal agencies approve it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The federal government, New York State and New Jersey should reject the Port Ambrose project because the facility could prevent forward movement on what could be New York state's first offshore wind project. Instead, the United States, New York state and the region should be working together to build a clean energy future. In fact, it would be the height of irony--and a damaging energy policy--to privilege the construction of a fossil-fuel import facility over a much-needed and long-overdue renewable offshore wind facility that represents a cleaner, healthier future for our children and future generations of New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are three most important reasons to oppose the Port Ambrose project:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, as I mentioned above, the LNG project conflicts with a pollution-free, offshore wind power project first proposed for the area in 2011 that is wending its way through the siting process and could help &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/why_new_york_needs_a_50_percen.html\"&gt;New York State get 50 percent of its electricity from renewable sources by 2050&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www.linycoffshorewind.com\"&gt;Long Island-New York City Offshore Wind Project&lt;/a&gt;, proposed by three public and private New York-area utilities--the New York Power Authority (NYPA), the Long Island Power Authority, and Con Edison--would have the capacity to produce 350 megawatts of clean electricity for the overtaxed New York City/Long Island grid. (The project can eventually be expanded to 700 megawatts.) Because offshore wind projects generate the most power when the grid needs it most, on hot summer afternoons and during cold snaps like the ones we've had so many of this winter, this project can significantly improve grid reliability, and, at 350 megawatts, could provide enough electricity to power almost 125,000 homes. Plus, it has great economic development potential. According to &lt;a href=\"http://www.aertc.org/docs/SBU%20OSW%20Eco%20Dev%20Final%2011-25.pdf\"&gt;a recent study by experts at SUNY Stonybrook&lt;/a&gt;, building a single, 250-megawatt offshore wind power project could create more than 2,800 full-time jobs and add $645 million to the local economy. With a full build-out of New York's offshore wind potential, &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kkennedy/with_new_roadmap_new_york_is_p.html\"&gt;the possibilities are even bigger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several private developers have also expressed interest in building offshore wind projects on this site. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.boem.gov\"&gt;Bureau of Ocean Energy Management&lt;/a&gt;, the federal agency responsible for offshore renewable energy programs, has responded favorably to all this interest, collecting both proposals for development and information for an environmental assessment and review of the area that will ultimately result in an auction for leasing rights to build an offshore wind project.&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though Liberty Natural Gas has called the NYPA offshore wind project and the LNG terminal \"compatible uses,\" they quite simply are not. Here's why: The proposed Port Ambrose project would fall directly inside NYPA's proposed offshore wind lease area. The LNG facility consists of two buoy systems which would receive natural gas from huge LNG vessels and send the gas to land via a pipeline. The LNG carriers would deliver an average of 400 million standard cubic feet of natural gas per day. The Port Ambrose facilities are estimated to receive up to 45 deliveries annually, with deliveries taking between 5 and 16 days to complete. According to BOEM, it may be necessary to require a safety zone of almost a mile around the buoy system when the LNG carriers are delivering LNG, for the same reason that a significant buffer is recommended for the wind turbines--to avoid collision and navigational risk.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The proposed Port Ambrose LNG facility--and the exclusion zone for the two buoys and the LNG delivery vessels--would be located in the upper third of the NYPA lease site--just the area that is likely best suited for offshore wind turbine siting. Thus, the Port Ambrose facility would not only compete directly with the NYPA offshore wind project for lease space, it would do so in the prime area for offshore wind construction, making construction and operation of the offshore wind project substantially more difficult and expensive, and potentially threatening the viability of the entire project. As BOEM has stated in earlier comments: \"the proposal to construct a LNG Port in the same area proposed for a large wind facility could result in serious conflicts--or at the minimum, complicating factors--that may impact the overall viability of one or both projects.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kkennedy/Offshore%20wind%20NYPA%20lease%20area%20map.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Offshore wind NYPA lease area map.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kkennedy/assets_c/2015/03/Offshore%20wind%20NYPA%20lease%20area%20map-thumb-500xauto-18973.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"384\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;As this map indicates, the proposed Port Ambrose LNG terminal would conflict with an offshore wind power project proposed in 2011 and now moving through the siting process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Second, there's no need for the Port Ambrose LNG project. As NRDC's comments explain, the very concept of building an LNG import facility is out-dated U.S. energy policy. These days, the United States has a natural gas glut. Exports have displaced imports, with numerous export facilities proposed; many import facilities remain underutilized. Moreover, by scaling up energy efficiency programs and renewable energy options, including offshore wind and on-site, clean, distributed energy sources such as solar power, we can more easily, quickly and cheaply meet the peak load and power needs of New York and Long Island. That's the vision of New York's emerging &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/rev-ing_it_up_in_new_york_a_lo.html\"&gt;Reforming Energy Vision policy&lt;/a&gt;, and Port Ambrose just doesn't fit in.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, as residents of Long Island, New York and New Jersey know only too well from our experiences with Superstorm Sandy, now is not the time to increase our dependence on dirty fossil fuels that will further disturb our climate, especially when clean alternatives like energy efficiency and renewable energy are available. What the New York and Long Island area need now to help meet our energy needs is not more dangerous fossil fuels but the clean energy that offshore wind power, on-land wind, solar power, and energy efficiency can provide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;MARAD and the Coast Guard can only approve the Port Ambrose project if they determine that \"the construction and operation of the deepwater [LNG project] will be in the national interest and consistent with national security and other national policy goals and objectives, including energy sufficiency and environmental quality.\" The Port Ambrose LNG facility most decidedly does not.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=jtCg6d9I4Ag:b0q0nBHSr1I:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=jtCg6d9I4Ag:b0q0nBHSr1I:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=jtCg6d9I4Ag:b0q0nBHSr1I:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/jtCg6d9I4Ag\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/kkennedy/for_nrdc_the_choices_cant.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">While state officials fight it, North Carolina continues down Clean Power path</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/WnwqCcZvoPI/while_state_officials_fight_it.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/lmartinez//52.18143</id>         <published>2015-03-17T13:02:33Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T13:42:04Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Luis Martinez, Senior Attorney, Energy and Transportation Program, Asheville, North Carolina:                  New analysis by the Natural Resource Defense Council shows that North Carolina's Clean Energy Future is strong.

Our analysis shows that by continuing its transition away from coal and meeting the requirements of its clean energy standard, North Carolina will achieve about 90% of the reductions required by the Clean Power Plan with nine years left until the 2030 deadline. And renewed commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energy will help the state achieve the goals while generating more jobs and less pollution. So while some naysayers, including the head of North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NC DENR), continue to work actively to derail the plan, it will help the state continue on a path it set for itself well over a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"http://www2.epa.gov/carbon-pollution-standards/clean-power-plan-proposed-rule\"&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt; from the Environmental Protection Agency limits carbon emissions from power plants with the goal of curbing climate change by transitioning towards clean energy. It sets pollution reduction targets and gives states both ample time and plenty of flexibility to achieve those goals. In North Carolina, as I've written &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lmartinez/north_carolina_off_to_a_great.html\"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;, we started down this path a long time ago with the introduction of the Clean Smokestacks Act. That Act was very similar to the Clean Power Plan, in that it set pollution reduction goals and gave the utilities plenty of time and flexibility to meet them. The result is that, over a decade later, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants have decreased over 80% without any electric reliability impacts and with significant &lt;a href=\"https://nicholasinstitute.duke.edu/sites/default/files/publications/ni_wp_12-05.pdf\"&gt;economic and health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Additionally, North Carolina continued its journey towards clean energy by requiring utilities to source an increasing share of their electricity from clean energy sources. The &lt;a href=\"http://www.ncuc.commerce.state.nc.us/reps/reps.htm\"&gt;Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard&lt;/a&gt; put the state in a path towards having 12.5% of the electricity in North Carolina come from renewable energy or energy efficiency by 2021. Yet again the state is well on its way to meeting this goal with plenty of time left and with significant economic and health benefits. As a new Duke University &lt;a href=\"http://www.cggc.duke.edu/pdfs/02152015Duke_CGGC_NCSolarEnergyReport.pdf\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; tells us the economic benefits from solar energy are significant and widespread. Additionally, North Carolina has become &lt;a href=\"http://www.seia.org/news/north-carolina-leads-south-2nd-nation-new-solar-installations\"&gt;a leader&lt;/a&gt; in that industry ranking second, behind only California for installed solar capacity in 2014. The state also moved into fourth place nationally on total installed solar capacity, only behind California, Arizona and New Jersey. And the state also ranks in eight place nationally in total &lt;a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/blog/energy/2015/03/top-ten-five-ways.html\"&gt;solar jobs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And yet today, like he did back in &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lmartinez/north_carolina_has_a_choice_on.html\"&gt;November of 2013&lt;/a&gt;, Donald van der Vaart, now head of North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources (NC DENR), will go before the House Energy and Commerce &lt;a href=\"http://energycommerce.house.gov/hearing/epa%E2%80%99s-proposed-111d-rule-existing-power-plants-legal-and-cost-issues\"&gt;Committee&lt;/a&gt; of the US Congress and do &lt;a href=\"http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF03/20150317/103073/HHRG-114-IF03-Wstate-vanderVaartD-20150317.pdf\"&gt;his part to stop&lt;/a&gt; the Environmental Protection Agency from moving forward on the Clean Power Plan. But North Carolina began this journey towards a strong clean energy economy well over a decade ago. We are now reaping the benefits of moving forward boldly and we know that with enough time and flexibility we will meet the Clean Power Plan goal. &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/clean-power-plan-state-options-NC.pdf\"&gt;NRDC's new analysis &lt;/a&gt;confirms that the Clean Power Plan will help North Carolina continue leading the way towards a clean energy economy while improving public health, fostering new economic development, and helping to stabilize our climate.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=WnwqCcZvoPI:8jj2-Optjb8:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=WnwqCcZvoPI:8jj2-Optjb8:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=WnwqCcZvoPI:8jj2-Optjb8:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/WnwqCcZvoPI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lmartinez/while_state_officials_fight_it.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Want to avoid toxic couch chemicals?

Read more about it on &lt;a href=\"http://saferchemicals.org/2015/03/13/nations-1-furniture-retailer-banning-toxic-flame-retardant-chemicals/\"&gt;Mind the Store's blog&lt;/a&gt;. Even better, Ashley announced that ALL of their new furniture, no matter where in the country, will comply with &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/vsingla/tagging_toxics_legislation_gre.html\"&gt;California's new labeling law&lt;/a&gt;, so shoppers can easily tell which couches contain toxic flame retardant chemicals and which ones don't.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Signed by Governor Brown last year, the CA labeling law requires all upholstered furniture (like couches, sofas, loveseats, and recliners) manufactured after January 1, 2015 to have a label that states whether or not harmful flame retardant chemicals were added to the product.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Simple, right? Well, the new label is easy to understand, but unfortunately the situation is more complicated when you go into a furniture store. Some stores are ahead of the game and are already offering products without these unnecessary and harmful chemicals. (These stores are listed in our &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/vsingla/buying_a_safer_sofa_nrdc_surve.html\"&gt;furniture store survey&lt;/a&gt; and also covered in a recent article from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/watchdog/ct-flame-retardants-furniture-20150123-story.html#page=1\"&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/a&gt;.) But not all the couches in stores will have the simple flame retardant label yet. That's because the labeling law &lt;span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"&gt;only&lt;/span&gt; applies to new furniture that's manufactured this year. Couches made in 2014 or earlier have different labels and may or may not contain flame retardants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, what do you need to look for before you buy?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;First, find the flammability/ law label attached to the furniture.

McConnell's big polluter agenda is blocking the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Obama's climate action initiatives. McConnell wants states to blow off the Clean Air Act by refusing to write a state plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;McConnell's call has startled many observers. Former New Jersey Governor Christie Todd Whitman, who served as President George W. Bush's first EPA administrator, wrote in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.politico.com_magazine_story_2015_03_mitch-2Dmcconnell-2Depa-2D116093.html-3Fml-3Dtl-5F20-23.VQdtrU1OVjq&amp;amp;d=AwMFAg&amp;amp;c=QbuapHRvbn0JdC8vTVkPHg&amp;amp;r=lJ-2xIfZf5VMP4SUJ1ovwg8Aa8Z-wgM5d2FJWIthilc&amp;amp;m=QPHrIarxGp9QLFVbJTdyFRUWtfc7dy56Do-aPS9IUrQ&amp;amp;s=nWSf1Y2GVKPQEKM07Md9jD0wMwVs8C7IRTP2CO-y0J8&amp;amp;e=\"&gt;Politico&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;yesterday that McConnell \"cannot and should not call on others to ignore a law.\" And power company executives are afraid of being &lt;a href=\"http://wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/utilities-say-collaboration-creativity-key-clean-power-plan\"&gt;caught in a political squeeze without a back-up plan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not a single governor has stepped forward to take McConnell's pledge. And there are good reasons. More and more states are awakening to the attractive clean energy options that will curb carbon pollution while building their economies, creating new jobs, and saving consumers billions on their electric bills. For the latest example, read &lt;a href=\"http://www.michigan.gov/documents/150313_Energy_Message_FINAL_484033_7.pdf\"&gt;Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's energy message&lt;/a&gt; last week, which sets ambitious clean energy goals for his state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And governors know that if they don't write a plan to clean up their power plants, the law requires the Environmental Protection Agency to do it. So the irony is that in urging states to say no, McConnell is calling for a transfer of authority and control from the states to Washington. That's not what Republicans usually recommend.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bear with me now for a quick explanation of how the Clean Air Act works. Since President Richard Nixon signed this landmark law in 1970, we've recognized that air pollution is a national problem. It doesn't stop at state borders. Both states and businesses need national minimum requirements that keep unscrupulous businesses from playing states off against one another and from undercutting responsible companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the same time, for 45 years the Clean Air Act has recognized states' leading role in shaping clean air plans to meet those federal limits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This sharing of federal and state responsibilities is called \"cooperative federalism,\" and it has been widely used since the New Deal. The Clean Air Act charges EPA with setting national standards for reducing dangerous air pollutants. The Act then gives the states the first option to regulate the sources of that pollution by adopting a state plan - a package of state pollution limits - which EPA approves if it will meet the applicable standard. The law tells EPA to stand in reserve, ready to regulate those sources directly through a federal plan if a state fails to adopt an approvable state plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cooperative federalism does not force the states to regulate. Rather, it respects states' important role by giving them the first opportunity to shape specific pollution control plans to meet national pollution targets in the way that best meet local circumstances. The federal role is as back-up, to regulate the pollution sources directly only if a state fails to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more than four decades, states have almost always taken the opportunity that the Clean Air Act offers them. Federal plans have been needed only rarely, and usually only briefly until the states take back the lead.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress does not have to proceed this way. Indeed, important parts of the Clean Air Act tell EPA to regulate power plants directly, with no state role - for example, to curb acid rain and cut toxic air pollutants. But cooperative federalism is the way Congress chose to go 45 years ago in the part of the Clean Air Act that covers pollutants like carbon dioxide from existing power plants, called Section 111(d). States get the first shot; the federal government steps in to regulate pollution sources - not to regulate the state - only if the state fails to act.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court recognized EPA's authority to curb power plants' carbon pollution through this cooperative model in 2011, in a case called &lt;a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/10-174.ZO.htmlhttps:/www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/10-174.ZO.html\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Electric Power v. Connecticut&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;EPA's Clean Power Plan follows the prescribed approach by setting carbon pollution targets tailored to the characteristics of the power sector in each state, and asking each state to develop its own plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back to McConnell's call for inaction. Governors aren't saying no because they, their power companies, and many other state stakeholders recognize that when the state writes its own plan, it has opportunities to tailor those pollution limits to best fit local circumstances. If a state drops the ball, the federal government must develop a federal pollution plan for that state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;EPA will propose and take comment on a federal plan this summer, when it finalizes the state targets after considering nearly four million comments. Almost certainly, the proposed federal plan will establish pollution limits that apply directly to the carbon-emitting power plants in a given state. Far from an onerous bogeyman, the federal plan will be affordable and flexible. It will allow sources to comply by directly reducing their emissions or by obtaining credits from actions across the electricity system that reduce carbon pollution, from generating electricity at cleaner or zero-emitting plants to reducing electricity demand (and therefore generation and pollution) by making homes, factories, and other businesses more energy-efficient. This federal plan will regulate the power plants, not the state, and it will come into play only if a state doesn't adopt an approvable state plan of its own.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;State leaders, power companies, and other stakeholders aren't rushing to get on McConnell's bandwagon because they know states have even more tools at their at their command than EPA - tools that can help do the job in the way that best fits their state. For example, states can adopt supplementary clean energy policies to promote renewables and efficiency, and they can help site transmission lines, etc. - steps that can further reduce costs and promote productive investments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In short, federal plans will be flexible and affordable, but states can create individualized plans that will work even better. Federal plans good, state plans better.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That's why power companies in many states have been working to kill or defang state legislation that would block states from adopting their own plans, or box states into high-cost approaches. For instance, in the recent session of the Virginia General Assembly, Dominion Resources quietly helped kill bills that would have obstructed the state from writing its own plan. In Kentucky, one of the largest power companies is openly raising &lt;a href=\"http://www.eenews.net/energywire/stories/1060014722\"&gt;the need to revisit a restrictive law&lt;/a&gt; adopted there last year. And Berkshire Hathaway Energy is urging states to &lt;a href=\"http://wyomingpublicmedia.org/post/utilities-say-collaboration-creativity-key-clean-power-plan\"&gt;make sure power companies have a back-up plan&lt;/a&gt; that they can meet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To be sure, some governors will join legal challenges when EPA finalizes the Clean Power Plan. But legal challenges are a long shot, so they are also very likely to hedge their bets by continuing to work on state plans, using all the clean energy options that the Clean Power Plan incorporates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for Sen. McConnell, he will try to pass legislation to block the plan. But he is unlikely to garner the 60 votes needed to pass such a bill in the Senate, and even less likely to get the 67 votes needed to override President Obama's veto. So he will continue to rage against EPA and urge governors to say no. Just don't expect too many to jump on the bandwagon.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=D3iybudS1xE:50Jpq3QeUEg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=D3iybudS1xE:50Jpq3QeUEg:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=D3iybudS1xE:50Jpq3QeUEg:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/D3iybudS1xE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ddoniger/why_states_arent_rushing_to_ju.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Cutting Carbon Pollution: Florida's Opportunity to Shine</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/uQLjElIKbsU/cutting_carbon_pollution_flori.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/privera//411.18142</id>         <published>2015-03-17T11:43:46Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T18:05:24Z</updated>              <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Pamela Rivera, Partnership and Constituency Advocate, Center for Policy Advocacy, Washington, D.C.:                   If there is something we know in Florida it's that protecting the beauty of our state's natural resources is a no-brainer.

In many ways we live in paradise, which is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;why protecting it for future generations is crucial. Climate change is a very clear and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;present danger in Florida and it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;threatens our economy that is so closely tied to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;our beautiful beaches and incredible wildlife.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In Florida, nearly half of the state's nearly 19 million residents live less than one meter above the local Mean High Water, which is the average of all the high water heights observed by the National Tidal Datum Epoch. Even a few inches of sea level rise can pose a major threat to areas in southeast Florida and in fact, we have seen many wells in that part of the state close due to contamination from sea level rise.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Climate change is happening. So where does that leave us? We have ideas in a new state primer for Florida released today, and I'll discuss some of them &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/clean-power-plan-state-options-FL.pdf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The single biggest source of carbon pollution in the U.S. comes from fossil-fuel power plants. They account for nearly 40 percent of U.S. carbon pollution. Currently, we limit mercury, lead and soot from these power plants, but not carbon pollution. This is just crazy and thankfully, it is changing. On June 2, 2014, the EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan, which sets the first-ever standards limiting carbon pollution. The plan, when in place, would &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/energy/clean-energy-benefits-vulnerable-communities.asp\"&gt;prevent&lt;/a&gt; about 550 million metric tons of carbon dioxide nationwide by 2030 and prevents 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths. That is HUGE!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Under the EPA's plan every state has the opportunity to craft its own best strategy to reduce pollution and protect our climate. Investing in energy efficiency and renewable solar and wind power should be a fundamental part of Florida's strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have seen that ramping up energy efficiency programs can create &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/state-benefits.asp\"&gt;10,000 new jobs&lt;/a&gt; in Florida and because using energy efficiency allows us to do more with less power, we can save more money on our electric bills!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We aren't known as the Sunshine State for nothing, Florida ranks third in solar potential, but is currently lagging and a lot of that comes from the lack of programs in state to help facilitate that growth. Energy efficiency and renewable energy are zero-carbon, low cost options that will help meet Florida's goals as it plans for the Clean Power Plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows Florida summers come fast and stay a while and that causes extensive use of air conditioning, which has a lot to do with why the &lt;a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/state/print.cfm?sid=FL\"&gt;average&lt;/a&gt; Florida household spend $1,900 every year on electricity--40 percent more than the U.S. average.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Florida is well-positioned to meet its carbon pollution target while expanding its clean energy portfolio&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;and should also continue to discuss potential collaboration with neighboring states under the Clean Power Plan. In many cases, a region multi-state approach to compliance is cheaper than states going it alone, as described in this &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/syeh/pjm_regional_cooperation_leads.htmlhttp:/switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/syeh/pjm_regional_cooperation_leads.html\"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from my colleague Starla Yeh, and further highlighted in this excellent&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedFiles/Publishing/Articles/Electric_System_Reliability_and_EPAs_Clean_Power_Plan_Case_of_PJM.pdf\"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analysis Group report&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;Our energy future rests in our hands. The Clean Power Plan presents us with a wonderful opportunity to move forward. Let's do it together.
