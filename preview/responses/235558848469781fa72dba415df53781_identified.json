This is caused by a relatively selective distal axonal degeneration involving the longest axons of the corticospinal tracts. Consequently, these conditions provide an opportunity to identify genes, proteins and cellular pathways that are critical for axonal health. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of the classification, clinical features and genetics of HSP, highlighting selected HSP subtypes (i.e. those associated with thin corpus callosum or cerebellar ataxia) that are of particular clinical interest. We will then discuss appropriate investigation strategies for HSPs, suggesting how these might evolve with the introduction of next-generation sequencing technology. Finally, we will discuss the management of HSP, an area somewhat neglected by HSP research. This is the final published version.

Absence of functional MYO1C disturbs the cellular distribution of lipid rafts, causes the accumulation of cholesterol-enriched membranes in the perinuclear recycling compartment, and leads to enlargement of endolysosomal membranes. Several feeder pathways, including classical endocytosis but also the autophagy pathway, maintain the health of the cell by selective degradation of cargo through fusion with the lysosome. Here we show that loss of functional MYO1C leads to an increase in total cellular cholesterol and its disrupted subcellular distribution. We observe an accumulation of autophagic structures caused by a block in fusion with the lysosome and a defect in autophagic cargo degradation. Interestingly, the loss of MYO1C has no effect on degradation of endocytic cargo such as EGFR, illustrating that although the endolysosomal compartment is enlarged in size, it is functional, contains active hydrolases, and the correct pH. Our results highlight the importance of correct lipid composition in autophagosomes and lysosomes to enable them to fuse. Ablating MYO1C function causes abnormal cholesterol distribution, which has a major selective impact on the autophagy pathway. This is the final published version.

Although Huntington's disease progression is linked to toxic accumulation of&#13; mutant huntingtin protein, loss of wildtype huntingtin function may also contribute to&#13; neuronal cell death but its precise function is not well understood. Therefore, we&#13; investigated the molecular role of huntingtin in exocytosis and observed that&#13; huntingtin knockdown in HeLa cells causes a delay in ER-to-Golgi transport and a&#13; reduction in the number of cargo vesicles leaving the trans-Golgi network. In&#13; addition, huntingtin is required for secretory vesicle fusion at the plasma membrane.&#13; Similar defects in the early exocytic pathway were observed in primary fibroblasts&#13; from homozygous Q140 huntingtin knock-in mice that lack wildtype huntingtin&#13; expression. Interestingly, heterozygous fibroblasts from a Huntington\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease&#13; patient with a Q180 expansion displayed no obvious defects in the early secretory&#13; pathway. Thus, our results highlight the requirement for wildtype huntingtin at&#13; distinct steps along the secretory pathway. This is the accepted manuscript.

R.; Smyth, Deborah J.; Pekalski, Marcin L.; Burren, Oliver S.; Cutler, Antony J.; Doecke, James D.; Flint, Shaun; McKinney, Eoin F.; Lyons, Paul A.; Smith, Kenneth G. C.; Achenbach, Peter; Beyerlein, Andreas; Dunger, David B.; Clayton, David G.; Wicker, Linda S.; Todd, John A.; Bonifacio, Ezio; Wallace, Chris; Ziegler, Anette-G. Diagnosis of the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes (T1D) is preceded by the appearance of circulating autoantibodies to pancreatic islets.  However, almost nothing is known about events leading to this islet autoimmunity.  Previous epidemiological and genetic data have associated viral infections and anti-viral type I interferon (IFN) immune response genes with T1D.  Here, we first used DNA microarray analysis to identify IFN-\\ufffd\\ufffd inducible genes in vitro and then used this set of genes to define an IFN-inducible transcriptional signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a group of active systemic lupus erythematosus patients (N=25).  Using this predefined set of 225 IFN signature genes, we investigated expression of the signature in cohorts of healthy controls (N=87), T1D patients (N=64) and a large longitudinal birth cohort of children genetically predisposed to T1D (N=109; 454 microarrayed samples).  Expression of the IFN signature was increased in genetically-predisposed children prior to the development of autoantibodies (P=0.0012), but not in established T1D patients.  Upregulation of IFN-inducible genes was transient, temporally associated with a recent history of upper respiratory tract infections (P=0.0064) and marked by increased expression of SIGLEC-1 (CD169), a lectin-like receptor expressed on CD14+ monocytes.  DNA variation in IFN-inducible genes altered T1D risk (P=0.007), as exemplified by IFIH1, one of the genes in our IFN signature and for which increased expression is a known disease risk factor.  These findings identify transient increased expression of type I IFN genes in pre-clinical diabetes as a risk factor for autoimmunity in children with a genetic predisposition to T1D.
