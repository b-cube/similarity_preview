One example of such plastic changes is the seasonal changes in the neural circuit responsible for singing behavior in song birds. The songbird neural circuit is comprised of the sensorimotor nucleus HVC and its target, the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Neuronal number in the HVC of adult song bird Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelli) changes seasonally with around 25%, or nearly 68,000, neurons being born and dying each breeding and nonbreeding season, respectively. White-crowned sparrow singing behavior also changes with season such that during breeding season birds produce more songs of high stereotypy. Resultantly, the avian song control system provides a unique model that allows us to investigate the basic natural processes, regulatory mechanisms, and behavioral results of neuronal birth and addition in the adult brain, or adult neurogenesis. Within this dissertation, I document the natural dynamics between new neuronal addition and mature neuronal death within and between breeding and nonbreeding seasons. I demonstrate that neuronal death and the resulting inflammatory response are both necessary and sufficient for increased production of new neurons and that neural activity is necessary and sufficient for the addition of the newly generated neurons into the song control neural circuit. Finally, I examine the genetic regulatory networks coordinating the multitude of processes and modulatory mechanisms of adult neurogenesis in the avian brain. Together, these studies uncover the basic cellular and genetic dynamics in addition to key regulatory mechanisms guiding successful incorporation and survival of adult-born neurons in functional neural circuits. Understanding the processes and mechanisms described herein is critical both for our basic understanding of adult neurogenesis and neural plasticity and for exploiting the clinical potential of neuronal replacement to repair damage associated with injury and neurodegenerative diseases.

Often, extensive deforestation has left only fragmented forests that are subject to human use, such as logging, and this is the case in the central Andes of Colombia, where 200 years of human use has left only 15% of the forest, scattered in mostly very small, narrow fragments.  This study evaluates the relationship impacts of both fragmentation and current bamboo forestry practices on red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), the largest mammal remaining in this landscape.  The underlying purpose of this study is to evaluate whether bamboo logging could be compatible with howlers' persistence in these forests, and if any changes in logging practice could improve prospects for howlers. A further goal is to identify opportunities to ameliorate the consequences of extreme habitat fragmentation, while providing benefits to the owners. Due to the fast growing characteristics of the bamboo, these forests could be used to increase habitat and to promote connectivity among fragments.  Results of this study show both reasons to be optimistic and to be cautious about the prospects for bamboo forestry to be compatible with conservation of red howler monkeys.  Bamboo logging does not directly impact the monkeys, who appear widely tolerant of logging activities since they do not impact their feeding trees.  However, bamboo extraction damages seedling and sapling trees, which appear to recruit poorly in these forests, threatening the regeneration of the key food resources for the howlers.  Combined with the impacts of fragment isolation, persistence of the howlers in this landscape likely depends on enhancing tree regeneration within logged bamboo fragments and expansion of existing fragments and creation of corridor or stepping stone habitats to promote movement of the monkeys among fragments.  With relatively small changes in the implementation of management regulations, conservation of red howler monkeys could be greatly enhanced in this landscape.

Reagan, Karen The Garry oak ecosystem is one of the most highly degraded ecosystems in North America due to fragmentation, development, and conversion to incompatible uses, with less than three percent of the ecosystem dominated by native plants (Noss 1995; Crawford and Hall 1997). Despite recognition of the dire state of the ecosystem, the best path toward recovery has been unclear. The research in this dissertation addresses questions fundamental to the restoration of the Garry oak ecosystem. We ask (1) are the native plant species commonly used for restoration of this ecosystem more seed limited or more microsite limited (Chapter 1); (2) which common restoration treatments provide the best opportunity for recruitment when seed is added (Chapter 2); and (3) what is the best way to determine the success of a restoration experiment that includes both seed addition and adaptive management techniques (Chapter 3)?

For genomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts, I report that their copies and their DNA integrity change greatly during development in maize. In order to accurately determine organellar genome number, I devise new experimental procedures to overcome limitations of the standard PCR-based methods. First, I describe a new experimental procedure to avoid the confusing influence of nuclear-located organellar DNA (orgDNA) sequences on authentic orgDNA using the PCR. The procedure includes designing organelle-specific primers using bioinformatics methods and methylation-sensitive PCR. In addition to copy number determination, this procedure should be useful in a wide range of applications, including phylogenetic and functional analyses, as well as in a clinical setting. Further, I devise a novel long-PCR method to quantify DNA damage, molecular integrity, copy number, and amount of repair for both plastid DNA and mitochondrial DNA during maize leaf development. I find a developmental increase in orgDNA damage and molecules with impediments that prevent amplification by &lt;italic&gt;Taq&lt;/italic&gt; polymerase, with light causing the greatest change. I also find a hundred- to a thousand-fold decrease in functional copies of orgDNA during leaf development. I suggest that the changes in molecular integrity of orgDNA during development are due to oxidative stress from energy metabolism that damages orgDNA. As leaves develop, the maintenance of high-copy orgDNA lessens, damage persists, and orgDNA is degraded. Furthermore, I confirm a hypothesis that oxidative stress causes DNA damage by studying differences in orgDNA between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells. Higher ROS levels occur in mesophyll due to the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. When compared to mesophyll cells, bundle sheath cells have less orgDNA damage and a higher percentage of unimpeded orgDNA. In addition, the orgDNA is more fragmented in mesophyll than bundle sheath cells. The data indicate that higher levels of ROS in mesophyll than bundle sheath cause orgDNA damage. The similar trend in orgDNA properties (copies, damage, and repair) for both plastid DNA and mitochondrial DNA suggests inter-organellar signaling and common regulation by nuclear genes.
