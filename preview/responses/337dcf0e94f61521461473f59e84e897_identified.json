The purpose of  this study was to obtain social, political, and economic information  from the \"youth\" portion of the socialization panel study, which began  in 1965 with a national sample of high school seniors, and from their  offspring aged 15 and older as of 1997. This data collection combines  the two sources of data in the form of parent-child pairs, with one  key objective being the analysis of influence relationships within the  family. The dataset is explicitly designed to facilitate the use of  parent-child pairs as the units of analysis. The parent portion  includes 478 cases, omitting the 457 cases (49 percent of the 935  total) for which there were no eligible offspring or where the  offspring could not be located, did not receive the self-administered  questionnaires (SAQ), or elected not to complete it. See YOUTH-PARENT  SOCIALIZATION PANEL STUDY, 1965-1997: YOUTH WAVE IV, 1997 (ICPSR 4023)  for the data file containing all of the Wave IV cases. The Offspring  portion (the third generation) includes 769 cases and can be used in  and of itself, but it omits 10 cases that could not be linked with a  particular parent. See NATIONAL SURVEY OF THIRD GENERATION MEMBERS OF  THE YOUTH-PARENT POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION STUDY, 1997 (ICPSR 3926) for  a data file containing all cases. Collection of SAQ data from the  offspring was dependent upon their parents' supplying the correct  locations of their eligible offspring. Background variables include  age, sex, religious orientation, level of religious participation,  marital status, ethnicity, educational status and background, place of residence, family income, and employment status.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1965\" cycle=\"P1\">1965</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1997\" cycle=\"P1\">1997</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1997-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-04</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1997-07\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-07</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit>                     <universe>All high school seniors in the United States in 1965 and their children aged 15 and older.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data, and event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The data collection consists of youths from the Wave III  panel of the original 1965 Youth-Parent Socialization Study who were  located and reinterviewed and their children aged 15 and older. The  original data collection was based on a national probability sample of high school seniors in 1965.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews, telephone interviews, and self-enumerated questionnaires             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to   these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><list type=\"bulleted\">  <itm>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</itm>  </list>  </cleanOps>              </dataColl>       <notes>                 (1) The data collection contains a weight variable in  the offspring portion. Overall, 32 percent of the pairs were based on  one child, 42 percent on two, 17 percent on three, and 4 percent on  four. Weights were assigned based on the number of children in the  dyad with the same parent (1 if only one child, 0.5 if two children,  and so forth). The principal investigators have used both weighted and  unweighted data in multivariate analysis and concluded that the  differences were quite minor (Jennings, M. Kent, and Laura Stoker,  \"Politics Across Generations: Family Transmission Reexamined,\"  unpublished paper, 2003, available from the principal investigators).  Users should consider for themselves whether the data should be  weighted by number of children for analytic purposes. (2) The codebook  is provided by ICPSR as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
