The 65 volcanoes listed meet at least one of the following criteria: 1) A historically documented eruption, or 2) a state of fumarolic activity, but without a historically documented eruption, or 3) potentially active volcanoes which have erupted in the past 3500 years (from dating of the last eruption). It is assumed that the definition of \"active volcano\" in data from SVERT parallels the definition from KVERT.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>The horizontal positions are reported to as many decimal degrees (at least 2, and up to 3) as the author feels the location can be confidently known. Longitude and latitudes were compiled from existing published resources and plotted using a GIS to visually verify accuracy. Locations were plotted with GIS on the USGS GTOPO30 digital elevation model to visually verify accuracy with topographic features. Location data provided by KVERT and SVERT were provided in degree-minute format. Although the data are given to the nearest minute, inspection of the data suggests that the coordinates are generally accurate to the closest 1/6 degree. Maps from KVERT and AVO were georeferenced and digitally rendered as transparent overlays as a second process to verify accuracy of locations. Where published locations of volcanic features appeared inaccurate, locations were validated by comparing maps and coordinates from multiple sources. Data from the Smithsonian Volcanism Project was generally selected as the most accurate source, and used for all volcanoes where an exact match existed to the KVERT and SVERT tables. The Smithsonian data are generally given to the nearest hundredth or thousandth of a decimal degree.</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Girina, O.A.</origin> <origin>Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team (KVERT) staff</origin> <pubdate>20100315</pubdate> <title>Catalog of Active Volcanoes, Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team (KVERT) website</title> <geoform>searchable web database </geoform> <othercit>accessed March 15, 2010</othercit> <onlink>http://www.kscnet.ru/ivs/kvert/volcanoes/index_eng.html</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>online </typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2010</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>publication date</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>Girina, O.A., and KVERT staff, 2010</srccitea> <srccontr>Provided names, coordinates, and last eruption dates for volcanoes of Kamchatka.</srccontr> </srcinfo> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Chivisova, M.</origin> <origin>Sakhalin Volcanic Eruption Response Team (SVERT) staff</origin> <pubdate>201002</pubdate> <title>Catalog of Kurile Volcanoes</title> <geoform>text </geoform> <othercit>personal communication, FEB RAS</othercit> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>electronic mail system </typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2010</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>publication date</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>Chivisova, M. and SVERT staff, 2010</srccitea> <srccontr>Provided names and coordinates of active volcanoes of the Kurile Islands</srccontr> </srcinfo> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Neal, C.A.</origin> <pubdate>2010</pubdate> <title>Active Volcanoes of the Kurile Islands</title> <geoform>n/a</geoform> <othercit>Personal communication</othercit> <onlink>http://www.avo.alaska.edu/</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>electronic mail system </typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2010</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>Neal, C.A., 2010</srccitea> <srccontr>Eruption dates for volcanoes of the Kurile Islands</srccontr> </srcinfo> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History staff</origin> <pubdate>201004</pubdate> <title>Volcano locations</title> <geoform>searchable web database</geoform> <othercit>accessed April 2010</othercit> <onlink>http://www.volcano.si.edu/</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>online </typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2010</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>publication date</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History staff, 2010</srccitea> <srccontr>Final Lat.-Long. location coordinates for most volcanoes were obtained from the Smithsonian Volcanism Program website, as available.</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> I obtained the GTOPO30 and ETOPO2 baselayer data from ESRI ArcGIS 9, ESRI Data and Maps 9.3.1, Service Pack 3.

IVS and KEMSD are located in Petropavlosk, Kamchatka peninsula, as part of the Kamchatka Science Center. The volcano information on the KVERT website is presented as a catalog providing the name, IAVCEI catalog #, Lat-Long location, date of the last eruption, and elevation of volcanoes of Kamchatka and the Northern Kurile Islands. The catalog was prepared from reports by KVERT, IVS, and scientific publications. Author and curator of the catalog is Olga Girina, IVS. Metadata for the catalog can be found on-line on the IVS website: http://www.kscnet.ru/ivs/metadata/index.php?f=show&amp;amp;id=185 (Russian language). To be considered an \"Active Volcano\" the volcanoes of the KVERT catalog must meet at least one of the following criteria. 1) A historically documented eruption, or 2) a state of fumarolic activity, but without a historically documented eruption, or 3) potentially active volcanoes which have erupted in the past 3500 years (from dating of the last eruption).SVERT (Sakhalin Volcanic Eruption Response Team) holds responsibility for monitoring volcanoes of the central and southern Kurile Islands. SVERT is a project within the Institute of Marine Geology and Geophysics, Yuzhno-Sakhalin, Sakhalin Island. SVERT is modeled on, but not identical to KVERT. Marina Chivisova provided a catalog of volcano locations for the Kurile Islands. Dates of the last eruption were provided by T. Neal of the Alaska Volcano Observatory (personal communication) citing data sources: (1) Alexander Rybin and Marina Chibasova, IMGG (working from Russian maps at scales of 1:50,000 and 1:200,000), (2) Simkin, T., and Siebert, L., 1994, Volcanoes of the world, Tucson, Arizona, Geoscience Press, Inc., 349 p; (3) the on-line database of the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution (http://www.volcano.si.edu/gvp/world/index.cfm). Some inconsistencies between sources remain unresolved, as reported by T. Neal. It is inferred that definitions of an \"Active Volcano\" are in SVERT parallel the definitions in KVERT. All of the locations were entered into a database, converted to decimal degrees, plotted in a GIS, and visually checked for accuracy. Indicated locations were compared to topographic features seen on the USGS GTOPO30 digital elevation model. Locations were also compared to georeferenced digital overlays of location maps found on the KVERT, IVS and AVO websites. http://www.kscnet.ru/ivs/kvert/volcanoes/map.html (Russian language). http://www.kscnet.ru/ivs/volcanoes/holocene/main/main.htm  http://www.avo.alaska.edu/pdfs/Volcanoes_svert_en.pdf  The Smithsonian Global Volcanism Project was consulted to resolve the few cases where discrepancies were noted between published coordinates and maps. The Smithsonian coordinates are more accurate than the KVERT and SVERT coordinates in terms significant figures of decimal degree locations, and in correspondence with topographic features. The Smithsonian coordinates were therefore generally used as the final value, where the Smithsonian database contained location data for the identical peak described by KVERT and SVERT. In most cases this resulted in a shift of 1-2 km from the original locations, substantially less than the symbol size used on the published maps. In rare instances where the Smithsonian data was only given to one-tenth decimal degree, the location was refined to the nearest one-hundredth decimal degree by referencing the topography.</procdesc> <srcused>Girina, O.A., and KVERT staff, 2010</srcused> <srcused>Chivisova, M. and SVERT staff, 2010</srcused> <srcused>Neal, C.A., 2010</srcused> <srcused>Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History staff, 2010</srcused> <procdate>2010</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Point</direct> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres>0.001</latres> <longres>0.001</longres> <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit> </geograph> <geodetic> <horizdn>World Geodetic System of 1984</horizdn> <ellips>World Geodetic System of 1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis> <denflat>298.2572223563</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <ealname>ActiveVolcanoesKamKur</ealname> <enttypl>ActiveVolcanoesKamKur.csv</enttypl> <enttypd>Spreadsheet data table with the following attributes: Volcano, latitude, longitude, and year_last_major_event</enttypd> <enttypds>this report</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>Volcano</attrlabl> <attrdef>The names of the volcanoes in this dataset were taken from the KVERT English-language catalog of active volcanoes of Kamchatka, and the English-language catalog of active volcanoes of the Kurile Islands provided by M.
