The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is produced by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology and is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors.  It covers Great Britain and Northern Ireland and incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets. LCM2007 was classified using a nomenclature corresponding to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompasses the entire range of UK habitats. In addition, it recorded further detail where possible. LCM2007 is produced in both vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.  Refer to the online supporting documentation and lineage statement for information regarding versions. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Pete Vodden</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LCM2007</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-10-14T10:20:24Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/b1540d75-bbec-4181-902f-f0b43eeee359\">     <title>Environmental Change Network (ECN) monitoring sites view service</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/b1540d75-bbec-4181-902f-f0b43eeee359</link>     <description>This service provides a view of Environmental Change Network (ECN) site locations from which data are collected.  There are 12 terrestrial sites and 45 freshwater sites. Sites range from upland to lowland, moor land to chalk grassland, small ponds and streams to large rivers and lakes.  ECN is the UK's long-term environmental monitoring programme. A wide range of integrated physical, chemical and biological variables which drive and respond to environmental change are collated, quality controlled and made freely available for scientific research. The data form an important evidence base for UK environmental policy development.  ECN is a multi-agency programme sponsored by a consortium of fourteen government departments and agencies. These organisations contribute to the programme through funding either site monitoring and/or network co-ordination activities.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental Change Network</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ECN</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LTER</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ILTER</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-08-22T15:46:24Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/b00c37c7-43ca-495e-aa79-e691d46c9ffa\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: site location data 2012</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/b00c37c7-43ca-495e-aa79-e691d46c9ffa</link>     <description>This dataset provides the details of all sites which have been monitored as part of the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS).

Collated indices are calculated annually for each individual butterfly species that has been recorded on five or more sites in that year. Based on this criterion collated indices have been calculated for the entire UKBMS time series from 1976 to the current year for the majority of species. For some rarer species the time series starts in a later year due to lack of data. Collated indices are calculated using a statistical model that accounts for missing data. The number of sites for each species ranges from 5 to several hundred and varies from year to year. Since 2008 more than 1,000 sites have been monitored across the UK each year. Collated indices are calculated so that we can determine how butterfly populations are changing over time across the UK. This data can be used, for example, to determine where to target conservation efforts and to measure the condition of the UK countryside. Butterflies are recognised as important indicators of biodiversity and environmental change (e.g. as official UK Biodiversity Indicators), and have been used in numerous research studies to understand the impacts of changes in climate and the extent and condition of habitats. Although the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of the Collated indices, the collection of the data used in their creation is ultimately reliant on a large volunteer community. The UKBMS is funded by a consortium of organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-05-22T14:34:04Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5afbbd36-2c63-4aa1-8177-695bed98d7a9\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: species trends 2012</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5afbbd36-2c63-4aa1-8177-695bed98d7a9</link>     <description>This dataset provides linear trends, over varying time periods, for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) Collated Indices of individual butterfly species across the UK.

The main statistical values derived from a linear regression (slope, standard error, P-value) are presented for the entire time series for each species (1976* to 2011), for the last 20 years, and for the last decade.   In addition a trend class, based on slope direction and its significance, and a percentage change for that time period are provided to describe the statistical trends. These trend data are provided for 59 UK butterfly species. Trends are calculated by performing a linear regression on the annual Collated indices for each species. Collated indices are calculated using a log-linear model incorporating individual site indices from all monitored sites across the UK for a given species in a given year.  Trends across different time series allow us to determine the long and short-term trends for individual species. This is enables us to focus conservation and research and also to assess species responses to conservation already in place. The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of this trend datasets.  The collection of the underlying data is reliant on a large volunteer community.  The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme is funded by a consortium of organisations  led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).    *Because the Collated indices are only calculated for each species in years in which it was recorded on five or more sites, the starting year for the series is later than 1976 for a number of rarer species. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-02-26T09:58:06Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/8fd064cc-fdd1-4dc1-ad89-d8497e1bcabe\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: site location data 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/8fd064cc-fdd1-4dc1-ad89-d8497e1bcabe</link>     <description>This dataset provides the details of all sites which have been monitored as part of the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Data includes the location within the UK, the length and width of the line transect on each site, and how long the transect has been monitored.  The UKBMS started in 1976 with fewer than 50 sites. The number of sites monitored each year has increased to over a thousand since 2008. There is turnover in sites monitored each year and details of the first and last year in which each site was surveyed are given.  The majority of site data is provided by recorders at the time a transect is created. The majority of these recorders are volunteers. The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) to collate the data and the UKBMS is funded by a consortium of organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-02-26T09:57:49Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d38b609b-7bc1-4204-86dd-022375208d4f\">     <title>The Isle of May long-term study (IMLOTS) seabird annual breeding success 1982-2012</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d38b609b-7bc1-4204-86dd-022375208d4f</link>     <description>This dataset contains calculated breeding success rates for six seabird species from representative colonies on the Isle of May, off the East coast of Scotland. Annual breeding success has been measured as the number of chicks fledged per active nest for the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica, since 1982), common guillemot (Uria aalge, since 1982), razorbill (Alca torda, since 1982), European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis, since 1987), black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla, since 1987) and northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis, since 1987). The number of active nests recorded are also provided. Data were collected as part of the Isle of May long-term study (IMLOTS), which aims to identify the impact of environmental change on seabirds and their associated ecosystems. This monitoring has been ongoing since 1974, by essentially the same team of scientists, using the same well-documented methods throughout this time.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Deena Mobbs</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-02-13T14:40:19Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/c4d0393e-ff0a-47da-84e0-09ca9182e6cb\">     <title>MultiMOVE: A Package of niche models for British vegetation</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/c4d0393e-ff0a-47da-84e0-09ca9182e6cb</link>     <description>MultiMOVE is an R package that contains fitted niche models for almost 1500 plant species in Great Britain. This package allows the user to access these models, which have been fitted using multiple statistical techniques, to make predictions of species occurrence from specified environmental data. It also allows plotting of relationships between species' occurrence and individual covariates so the user can see what effect each environmental variable has on the specific species in question. The package is built under R 2.10.1 and depends on R packages 'leaps', 'earth', 'fields' and 'mgcv'. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vegetation science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ecological Processes &amp; Resilience</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-11-27T11:57:19Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
