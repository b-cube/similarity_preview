Inpatient hospitalization data are aggregated into 5-year groupings for years 2000-2012.  ED visit data are annual for years 2005-2012.  Types of CO poisonings are broken out by fire-related, non-fire-related, and unknown cause.  The data are stratified by county, year, and fire-relatedness. </abstract> <purpose>To provide data that is consistent with the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network guidance for creating the CO poisoning inpatient hospitalization and emegency department visit Nationally Consistent Data and Measures (NCDMs). </purpose> <supplinf>Data have been de-identified to protect patient confidentiality.  CO poisoning hospitalizations are selected based on admitting diagnosis coding.  &#13; &#13; The California EPHT Program receives calendar year hospitalization and emergency department data annually from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).  Further information on OSHPD is located at:  www.oshpd.ca.gov.&#13; &#13; All state licensed hospitals in California are required by California Health and Safety Code to report to OSHPD data elements for each inpatient discharged from the hospital and each emergency department visit.  The facilities submit their data via the Medical Information Reporting for California (MIRCal), an on-line data transmission method.  Additional fields are computed by OSHPD.  &#13; </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20000101</begdate> <begtime/> <enddate>20121231</enddate> <endtime/> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Annually</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.409721</westbc> <eastbc>-114.131208</eastbc> <northbc>42.009521999999997</northbc> <southbc>32.53416</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ICD-9-CM</themekt> <themekey>Carbon monoxide, CO, 986, E8682, E8683, E8688, E8689, E9520, E9521,</themekey> <themekey>E9820, E9821</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>NONE</themekt> <themekey>Hospitalization, Environmental Health Tracking Program, EPHT, Environmental Health</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>ISO 3166-1 Country</placekt> <placekey>06001, Alameda County, 06003, Alpine County, 06005, Amador County, 06007, Butte County, 06009, Calaveras County, 06011, Colusa County, 06013, Contra Costa County, 06015, Del Norte County,</placekey> <placekey>06017, El Dorado County, 06019, Fresno County, 06021, Glenn County, 06023, Humboldt County, 06025, Imperial County, 06027, Inyo County, 06029, Kern County, 06031, Kings County, 06033, Lake County,</placekey> <placekey>06035, Lassen County, 06037, Los Angeles County, 06039, Madera County,</placekey> <placekey>06041, Marin County, 06043, Mariposa County, 06045, Mendocino County,</placekey> <placekey>06047, Merced County, 06049, Modoc County, 06051, Mono County,</placekey> <placekey>06053, Monterey County, 06055, Napa County, 06057, Nevada County,</placekey> <placekey>06059, Orange County, 06061, Placer County, 06063, Plumas County,</placekey> <placekey>06065, Riverside County, 06067, Sacramento County,</placekey> <placekey>06069, San Benito County, 06071, San Bernardino County,</placekey> <placekey>06073, San Diego County, 06075, San Francisco County,</placekey> <placekey>06077, San Joaquin County, 06079, San Luis Obispo County,</placekey> <placekey>06081, San Mateo County, 06083, Santa Barbara County,</placekey> <placekey>06085, Santa Clara County, 06087, Santa Cruz County, 06089, Shasta County,</placekey> <placekey>06091, Sierra County, 06093, Siskiyou County, 06095, Solano County,</placekey> <placekey>06097, Sonoma County, 06099, Stanislaus County, 06101, Sutter County,</placekey> <placekey>06103, Tehama County, 06105, Trinity County, 06107, Tulare County,</placekey> <placekey>06109, Tuolumne County, 06111, Ventura County, 06113, Yolo County,</placekey> <placekey>06115, Yuba County</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>Restricted (secure) data will only be released to external users after the California EPHT Program and representatives from OSHPD have reviewed the request.

Each year, OSHPD compiles the data from all hospitals to create the Patient Discharge Database (PDD) and Emergency Department database. &#13; Each year, CEHTP obtains the PDD and ED dataset from OSHPD and creates datasets to be used for public health surveillance, while maintaining confidentiality. &#13; This dataset on the CEHTP portal includes hospitalizations  unintentional carbon monoxide poisonings for the years 2001 to 2012.  Each event is identified by looking at all diagnosis codes (up to 24) based on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).   Each hospitalization event is identified based on date of discharge from the hospital.&#13; Counts, rates, and confidence intervals were calculated by county, age-group, gender, and race/ethnicity.&#13; We use population data from the California Department of Finance (DOF) For years 2000-2010: DOF uses the 2000 and 2010 population data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and takes into account births, deaths, and migration for California to estimate the intercensal California population by county, race/ethnicity, age, and gender for 2000-2010 (State of California, Department of Finance, Race/Hispanics Population with Age and Gender Detail, 2000\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2010. Sacramento, California, September 2012.).Years 2011-2012: DOF used the 2010 population data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and takes into account survival rates, migration patterns, and fertility rates for California to project the California population by county, race/ethnicity, age, and gender for 2010-2060 (State of California, Department of Finance, Report P-3: State and County Population Projections by Race/Ethnicity, Detailed Age, and Gender, 2010-2060.
