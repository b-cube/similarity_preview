Randomly selected Chicago, Illinois, lawyers were asked about,  for example, the nature of their work, work settings, fields of  practice, job satisfaction, career histories, professional commitment,  client characteristics, and social and political values. Results  revealed important changes in the legal profession between 1975 and  1995: women entered the profession in substantial numbers, new  specialties were created, law firms and corporate legal departments  grew dramatically, and in many organizations the practice of law  became constrained by bureaucratic rules and procedures. Background  information includes state of residence during high school, college or  university attended, law school attended, law school class rank,  political preference, degree of political party affiliation, religious  preference, marital status, nationality, year of birth, income, race,  zip code, number of children, work status of spouse, spouse's  nationality, respondents' mother's occupation, respondents' mother's  law school, respondents' father's occupation, and respondents' father's law school.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1994\" cycle=\"P1\">1994</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1995\" cycle=\"P1\">1995</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1994-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1994-06</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1995-07\" cycle=\"P1\">1995-07</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Chicago</geogCover>             <geogCover>Illinois</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Lawyers in good standing with the Illinois Attorney  Registration and Disciplinary Commission who had a Chicago address and  were under the age of 80 and alive in 1994, African American lawyers  working in Chicago in 1994, and Latino lawyers working in Chicago in 1994.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    There are three separate samples in the dataset: (1) A  simple random sample was used. (2) African American respondents from  the simple random sample were then asked to nominate other African  American lawyers in each of a number of practice settings. A random  sample stratified by practice setting was then selected from these  nominations. (3) Latino lawyers were chosen by identifying every  lawyer listed in Sullivan's directory with a last name that matched  those on a list of Spanish surnames compiled by the United States Census. A random sample was then taken from that list.          </sampProc>                                                    <collMode>computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)</collMode>                       <collMode>paper and pencil interview (PAPI)</collMode>                 <weight>               none     </weight>                 </dataColl>               <anlyInfo>                 <respRate>                                                                  82 percent (simple random sample) -- 8 percent  refused and 10 percent were not interviewed due to scheduling  difficulties or illness, 71.4 percent (African American sample), 54 percent (Latino sample).                               </respRate>                  </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR04100.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                                   <restrctn>                                    Access to these data is restricted.
