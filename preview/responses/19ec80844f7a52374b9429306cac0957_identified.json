The NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratories at Pascagoula and Stennis Space Center and the NOAA National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) at Stennis Space Center began the Hypoxia Watch project in 2001. Scientists aboard the NOAA Research Vessel Oregon II measure seawater properties, such as water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and dissolved oxygen at each of approximately 240 locations as the Oregon II cruises the waters south of Pascagoula, MS and then makes its way from Brownsville, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A scientist aboard the ship processes the measurements from electronic dissolved oxygen sensors, checks the measurements periodically with chemical analyses of the seawater, then sends the data by e-mail to NCDDC at Stennis Space Center approximately every three to five days. Physical Scientists at NCDDC transform the dissolved oxygen measurements into contour maps, which identify areas of low oxygen, or hypoxia. During the 6-week cruise, as the data is received from the ship, NCDDC generates new maps and immediately publishes them on the web. The first map will usually cover an area off the Mississippi coast, successive maps will add areas of the continental shelf from Brownsville to Galveston, and the final map will usually cover the entire Texas-Louisiana-Mississippi coast.  The 2009 summer cruise extended eastward to areas off the coast of Alabama and Florida during Leg 3. Maps are published every three to five days from approximately June 10 to July 20.</abstract> <purpose>These maps form the basis for summertime advisories on anoxic and hypoxic conditions in the North-central Gulf of Mexico and are intended for federal, state, and local government environmental decision makers. Other users include recreational and commercial fishermen, educators, resource managers, and researchers. Scientists use this environmental data to understand the effects of the physical environment on fish and other marine organisms. The dissolved oxygen maps generated during the SEAMAP cruise also help NOAA scientists plan the annual survey of the Gulf of Mexico hypoxic zone, which is conducted by the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON) in late July, when the hypoxic zone is typically at its peak. Cooling waters and storms in the Fall mix up the water throughout the Gulf of Mexico and restore normal oxygen levels to the sea floor.</purpose> <supplinf>This environmental data complements the main objective of the four week SEAMAP cruise, which is to survey stocks of commercially important fish in the Gulf of Mexico. The Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP) is a cooperative State, Federal, and university program that collects, manages and disseminates fishery-independent data and information in the southeastern United States. The effort is part of the SEAMAP summer groundfish survey conducted in the Gulf of Mexico by the National Marine Fisheries Service aboard the NOAA Ship Oregon II. The survey follows a predetermined stratified random survey design to sample fishes and invertebrates in trawls, bongo and neuston nets, and acquire environmental data with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) hydrocasts at stations located in the general area between the 10 and 200 m isobaths from Brownsville, Texas eastward to the Mississippi River. The CTD is equipped with sensors to measure water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, fluorescence, and transmittance continuously from the surface to the sea bottom. Approximately 240 stations are sampled during the cruise, which is divided into up to three legs of varying lengths during June and July, depending on weather and equipment. The bottom oxygen maps are produced approximately weekly during the six week survey cruise. The actual CTD data from which these maps are derived is available from NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Mississippi Laboratory in Pascagoula after the R/V Oregon II returns to port. The Hypoxia Watch process was developed by the NOAA CoastWatch Gulf of Mexico Regional Node at Stennis Space Center. CoastWatch provides satellite imagery and other environmental data to government decision makers and academic researchers. The Gulf of Mexico Regional Node is one of several sites throughout the United States set up for the processing and distribution of CoastWatch information. One area of current research is to see if imagery taken from satellites and aircraft can be useful in analyzing and predicting hypoxic conditions. Although remotely sensed imagery cannot directly measure dissolved oxygen levels in the ocean, it can measure other things that contribute to the formation of hypoxic waters, such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll.</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20090608</begdate> <enddate>20090717</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-97.36</westbc> <eastbc>-86.37</eastbc> <northbc>30.37</northbc> <southbc>25.99</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>hypoxia</themekey> <themekey>anoxia</themekey> <themekey>dead zone</themekey> <themekey>dissolved oxygen</themekey> <themekey>SEAMAP</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt> <themekey>oceans</themekey> <themekey>014</themekey> <themekey>environment</themekey> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt> <placekey>Gulf of Mexico</placekey> <placekey>Louisiana</placekey> <placekey>Texas</placekey> <placekey>Mississippi</placekey> <placekey>Alabama</placekey> <placekey>Florida</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>None</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>NOAA/NESDIS/NODC/NCDDC - National Coastal Data Development Center</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>1021 Balch Blvd.</address> <address>Suite 1003</address> <city>Stennis Space Center</city> <state>MS</state> <postal>39529</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>228-688-2936</cntvoice> <cntfax>228-688-2968</cntfax> <hours>8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday</hours> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <browse> <browsen>http://www.ncddc.noaa.gov/approved_recs/ncddc_ims/gis/ims/final/2009stations_browse_2009stations.jpg</browsen> <browsed>2009 Final combined CTD stations</browsed> <browset>JPEG</browset> </browse> <native>Microsoft Windows XP Professional and ESRI ArcGIS 10</native> </idinfo> <dataqual> <attracc> <attraccr>The manufacturer's specifications state that the SBE43 oxygen sensor deployed on the CTD (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth) is accurate to within 2% of the oxygen saturation level and drifts at a rate of about 2% for each 1,000 hours of use.
