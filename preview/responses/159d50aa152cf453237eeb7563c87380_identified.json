Prior to&#13; protracted drug exposure, most rats prefer natural rewards, such as saccharin, over cocaine.&#13; However, a subpopulation of animals prefer cocaine over natural rewards and are thought to&#13; be vulnerable to addiction. Specific behavioural traits have been associated with different&#13; dimensions of drug addiction. For example, anxiety predicts loss of control over drug intake&#13; whereas sensation seeking and sign-tracking are markers of a greater sensitivity to the&#13; rewarding properties of the drug. However, how these behavioural traits predict the&#13; disinterest for natural reinforcers remain unknown. In a population of rats, we identified&#13; sensation seekers (HR) on the basis of elevated novelty-induced locomotor reactivity, high&#13; anxious rats (HA) based on the propensity to avoid open arms in an elevated-plus maze and&#13; sign-trackers (ST) by increased tendency to approach stimuli previously associated with&#13; reward. Rats were then tested on their preference for saccharin over cocaine in a discretetrial&#13; choice procedure. We show that HR rats display a greater preference for saccharin over&#13; cocaine compared to ST and HA whereas the motivation for the drug was comparable&#13; between the three groups. The present data suggest that sensation seeking, by&#13; predisposing to a higher sensitivity to the rewarding value of natural reinforcers at the&#13; expense of drug, may be a protective trait for developing drug addiction.

NIH-12848 (NCGC00012848-02), a putative phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-&#13; kinase \\ufffd\\ufffd (PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd) inhibitor, was explored as a tool for investigating this enigmatic,&#13; low activity, lipid kinase. PI5P 4-kinase assays in vitro showed that NIH-12848&#13; inhibited PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd with an IC50 of approximately 1\\ufffd\\ufffdM but did not inhibit the \\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; PI5P4K isoforms at concentrations up to 100\\ufffd\\ufffdM. A lack of inhibition of PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; ATPase activity suggested that NIH-12848 does not interact with the enzyme\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds ATP&#13; binding site, and direct exploration of binding using hydrogen-deuterium exchange&#13; mass spectrometry revealed the putative PI5P-binding site of PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd to be the likely&#13; region of interaction. This was confirmed by a series of mutation experiments, which&#13; led to the identification of a single PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd amino acid residue that can be mutated to&#13; its PI5P4Ks \\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd homologue to render PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd resistant to NIH-12848 inhibition.&#13; 10\\ufffd\\ufffdM NIH-12848 was applied to cultured mouse principal kidney cortical collecting&#13; duct (mpkCCD) cells, which we show express PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd that increases when the cells&#13; grow to confluence and polarise. NIH-12848 inhibited the translocation of&#13; Na+/K+ATPase to the plasma membrane that occurs when mpkCCD cells grow to&#13; confluence, and also prevented reversibly their forming of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddomes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd on the culture&#13; dish. Both these NIH-12848-induced effects were mimicked by specific RNAi knockdown&#13; of PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd, but not that of PI5P4Ks \\ufffd\\ufffd or \\ufffd\\ufffd. Overall the data reveal a likely&#13; contribution of PI5P4K\\ufffd\\ufffd to the development and maintenance of epithelial cell&#13; functional polarity, and show that NIH-12848 is a potentially powerful tool for&#13; exploring the cell physiology of PI5P4Ks.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC) via type 1 PTH receptors (PTH1R) and potentiates the Ca2+ signals evoked by carbachol, which stimulates formation of IP3. We confirmed that in HEK cells expressing PTH1R, acute stimulation with PTH(1-34) potentiated carbachol-evoked Ca2+ release. This was mediated by locally delivered cyclic AMP (cAMP), but unaffected by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA), exchange proteins activated by cAMP, cAMP phosphodiesterases (PDE) or substantial inhibition of AC. Sustained stimulation with PTH(1-34) causes internalization of PTH1R-AC signalling complexes, but the consequences for delivery of cAMP to IP3R within cAMP signalling junctions are unknown. Here we show that sustained stimulation with PTH(1-34) or with PTH analogues that do not evoke receptor internalization reduced the potentiated Ca2+ signals and attenuated carbachol-evoked increases in cytosolic IP3. Similar results were obtained after sustained stimulation with NKH477 to directly activate AC, or with the membrane-permeant analogue of cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP. These responses were independent of PKA and unaffected by substantial inhibition of AC. During prolonged stimulation with PTH(1-34), hyperactive cAMP signalling junctions, within which cAMP is delivered directly and at saturating concentrations to its targets, mediate sensitization of IP3R and a more slowly developing inhibition of IP3 accumulation.

Here we review some of the key questions about the PI5P4Ks, their localisation, interaction, and regulation and also we summarise our current understanding of how PI5P is synthesised and what its cellular functions might be. Finally, some of the evidence for the involvement of PI5P4Ks in pathology is discussed. This is the author's accepted manuscript and will be under embargo until the 2nd of October 2015.
