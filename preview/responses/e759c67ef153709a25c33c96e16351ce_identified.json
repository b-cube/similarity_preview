The researchers will investigate forensic technologies with the potential to impact crime across Europe and globally.</p> <p>The research projects are all based at the University of Leicester and are co-supervised by academics in a wide range of disciplines including Genetics, Criminology, Chemistry, Psychology, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Pathology and Immunity, Infection and Inflammation.</p> <p>Dr Lisa Smith, INTREPID Forensics Project Coordinator and senior lecturer in the Department of Criminology, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences conference and postgraduate symposium was the perfect event for the launch of the INTREPID Forensics project. It provided a great opportunity for the ten PhD researchers on the INTREPID project to network with other postgraduate students and industry experts, as well as raising awareness of the project within the wider forensic community.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Dr Anya Hunt, CEO of the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences, added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences were delighted to host their annual Autumn conference and AGM at College Court in Leicester this year. In the 30th anniversary year since the DNA profiling discovery at the University of Leicester, and with the launch if the INTREPID Forensics project, it was an opportunity not to be missed. The Society\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds trace evidence conference and parallel post graduate research symposium, organised in conjunction with Dr. Lisa Smith, were both a huge success. We look forward to seeing the INTREPID project develop and we hope to see the student present their findings at future events.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The conference, held at College Court, focused on the theme of trace evidence and attracted academics and practitioners from across the forensic sciences. There was also a Postgraduate Symposium which featured student research presentations from universities all over the UK and across a wide range of forensic disciplines.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>All of the INTREPID Forensics researchers are writing research blogs about their experiences over the next three years.
