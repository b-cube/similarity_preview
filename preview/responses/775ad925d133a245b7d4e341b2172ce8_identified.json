The study consists of five related surveys grouped   around two main survey components: the referendum surveys and the   election surveys. Respondents participated in at least two surveys, but   not in all five. The election surveys were completed just prior to and   after the October 25, 1993, Canadian election, and consist of campaign   period, post-election, and mail-back components. The referendum surveys   were completed just prior to and after the October 26, 1992, referendum   on the Charlottetown Accord. The Charlottetown Accord contained various   proposals, including the separation of Quebec from Canada as a   sovereignty, the guarantee of one-quarter of the seats in the House of   Commons to Quebec, and recognition of the right of Canada's aboriginal   peoples to govern themselves. The major areas of investigation across   all surveys were political and social awareness, attitudes, voting   intentions, and behavior centered around major issues of   representation, job and employment, government spending, taxes, social   programs, crime and punishment, and continentalism. Variables assessed   public interest in the referendum by asking respondents about the   perceived effect of the referendum on their living standards, their   vote intentions, predictions of the outcome of the vote, reactions to   the results of the vote, knowledge about and opinions of specific   provisions of the Accord, and awareness of the stand taken by political   leaders, groups, and organizations regarding the Accord. Other   variables probed respondents' opinions of the parties and leaders, Kim   Campbell's performance in her cabinet job before she became Prime   Minister, women and racial minorities, party preference, ideological   leanings, vote history, and position on several policy issues.   Additional items address general attitudes toward the deficit and   higher taxes, abortion, Senate reform, aboriginal people, Canadian   unity and Quebec sovereignty, feminists, homosexuals, immigrants, the   business community, the media, unions, God, democracy, unemployment,   inflation, and pensions. Demographic data collected on respondents   include age, marital status, level of education, employment status,   income level, religious affiliation, union affiliation, citizenship,  ethnicity, language, and gender.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1992-09\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-09</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1994-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1994-03</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1992-09\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-09</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1994-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1994-03</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Canada</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adult noninstitutionalized population of Canada living in  households.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A rolling cross-section sample of Canadian citizens 18   years of age or older in private homes who speak one of Canada's  official languages in the ten Canadian provinces.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          telephone interviews, and self-enumerated questionnaires             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>               <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR06571.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
