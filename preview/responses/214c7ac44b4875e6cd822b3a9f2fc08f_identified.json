The Foresight exercise focused on the organization and directions of international science in 2031 (the year of ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffds centennial celebration) and was deliberately designed to explore a longer-term horizon beyond the immediate strategic planning period. It was done in two parts:</p> <p>Part 1 consisted of a broad consultation with the scientific community, in particular ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds national and union Members, to identify \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkey drivers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that will shape international science over the next two decades. These drivers were then used to develop four plausible exploratory scenarios to explore how different factors may combine to influence the science landscape.</p> <p>Part 2, which is the focus of this report, built on the work done for the exploratory scenarios, to develop a more aspirational \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuccess scenario\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. An initial draft of this success scenario, including its potential implications for ICSU, was produced at a workshop in 2011 and this was then refined after a series of consultations with the ICSU community. As a final step, it was \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdroad-tested\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd against the four exploratory scenarios that had been developed in part 1, which led to the identification of key challenges or tensions that ICSU is likely to face between now and 2031. Some potential responses to these challenges are included in this report.</p> <p>The two reports are complementary and ideally should be read sequentially although they are written as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdstand alone\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd documents. The detailed rationale for the choice of a scenario approach to foresight is given in report 1 and will not be repeated here. However, it is important to emphasise that foresight scenarios, including the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuccess scenario\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that follows, are not designed to be predictions. One of the most common criticisms of foresight is that you cannot predict the future, which is absolutely true but also reflects a misunderstanding of what foresight is about. Building foresight scenarios is a way of combining current knowledge and trajectories<br />with creative thinking and imagination to explore potential future pathways in a very complex world. It is highly unlikely that any of the four exploratory scenarios or the success scenario will be fully realised but elements of them are likely to occur in some combination. Having thought about these issues beforehand should enable ICSU as an organisation to be more agile and responsive. Knowing what our ideal \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuccess scenario\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd world would be like can help us to contribute better to realising at least a piece of that world.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Saskia Heijltjes</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Foresight</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Science for Policy</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-11-16T17:01:12Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/publications/reports-and-reviews/icsu-foresight-analysis/icsu-foresight-analysis\">     <title>ICSU Foresight Analysis </title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/publications/reports-and-reviews/icsu-foresight-analysis/icsu-foresight-analysis</link>     <description>Report 1 International science in 2031 - exploratory scenarios</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This, the first of two reports recounting the ICSU Foresight Analysis, describes the analysis carried out under Phases 1 and 2 of a process that has engaged the ICSU community in an important long-term planning exercise\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdexploring the future of international science in 20 years\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd time.</p> <p>Under the guidance and direct involvement of the ICSU Committee on Scientific Planning and Review (CSPR), a foresight scenarios exercise began in late 2009 to identify the key drivers that are likely to have a major influence on science and society over the coming decades. Through broad consultation, a range of issues from science literacy to geopolitics and global warming were identified and used as a basis for developing four draft potential scenarios of how the world might evolve. These scenarios described in the Report are not specific to ICSU and should also be of use to other organizations such as ICSU Members as a means of exploring their own longer-term roles in the international arena.</p> <p>From an ICSU perspective, the next step is to develop a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuccess scenario\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd for 2031 and extrapolate back to identify feasible steps that ICSU can take to help realize this scenario. Of course, the future cannot be predicted, and this is not the aim of the foresight exercise. However, ICSU and international science can make a significant contribution to shaping the future; exploring where we would like to be two decades from now can help in selecting the best pathways to achieve this vision.</p> <p>Publication of Report 2 devoted to the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuccess scenario\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is expected during the first half of 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Howard Moore</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Foresight</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Science for Policy</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2011-12-10T18:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/events/ICSU%20Events/foresight-workshop\">     <title>Foresight Workshop</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/events/ICSU%20Events/foresight-workshop</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The ICSU Foresight Workshop will explore the potential development of international science over the next two decades in a changing economic, social, political, and environmental context and testing the role and mission of ICSU to inform its long-term strategic choices, as well as benefiting members and other stakeholders.
