Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999/2000 (age 41/2 - SN 5578), 2004-2005 (age 46/47 - SN 5579), 2008-2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10% representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002-2004, 9,340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004/2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the &lt;a href=\"http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000032\" title=\"NCDS series page\"&gt;NCDS series page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Further information about the NCDS can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk\" title=\"Centre for Longitudinal Studies\"&gt;Centre for Longitudinal Studies&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>The &lt;i&gt;Parent Migration&lt;/i&gt; research project had four aims:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;an investigation of how children fare in educational attainments and behavioural adjustment, following change in family circumstances. This was done for children of the NCDS, making innovative use of multivariate multilevel modelling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to see which children were likely to be resilient and which vulnerable to which type of change in their social environment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;to provide a systematic statistical backdrop on the population aged 5-16 in 1991, with the child as the unit of observation, taking evidence from the &lt;i&gt;ONS Longitudinal Study&lt;/i&gt; (not held at the UKDA). This should show how far the sample of second generation NCDS children were representative of all children in experiencing change in who they live with and where, relating such histories to indicators of their living standards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;an enhancement of the NCDS5 dataset (see SN 5567) by coding and organizing data on migration, making a resource for other researchers. The methods used in the project were entirely quantitative, combining both description and analysis of secondary sources, the &lt;i&gt;ONS Longitudinal Study&lt;/i&gt; and the second generation sample of NCDS cohort members and their children aged 5-18&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This dataset contains information on the 'address history' of a sub-sample (2,657 members) of the NCDS who provided a mother/child questionnaire in 1991. One third of NCDS members identified to have at least one child old enough to complete maths and reading tests were requested to take part in the survey. Initial work was carried out by the NCDS User Support team as part of the 'Changing Home' project to code postal town data from NCDS5. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; For the second edition (August 2008), the serial number has been replaced with a new one, variable Ncdsid. This change has been made for all datasets in the NCDS series. Further information may be found in the 'CLS Confidentiality and Data Security Review', included in the documentation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>&lt;B&gt;Main Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt; The dataset contains migration indicators for each change of address, a summary of inter-regional moves and data on migrations in/out of the UK.</abstract>       <sumDscr>         <timePrd>Primarily 1991, with some summary retrospective information relating to 1958-1991.</timePrd>         <nation>Great Britain</nation>         <geogUnit>Standard Statistical Regions</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit>         <anlyUnit> Families/households</anlyUnit>         <universe>National</universe>         <universe>Children</universe>         <universe>Families</universe>         <universe>Parents</universe>         <universe>Young people</universe>         <universe>One third sample of all children in England, Scotland and Wales born during one particular week in 1958, who had submitted a mother and child questionnaire for NCDS5 in 1991, with children old enough to complete maths/reading tests in 1991.</universe>         <dataKind>Numeric data</dataKind>         <dataKind> Individual (micro) level</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <timeMeth>Longitudinal/panel/cohort</timeMeth>         <timeMeth>Parent migration data derived from the 5th sweep of NCDS.</timeMeth>         <dataCollector>University of London.
