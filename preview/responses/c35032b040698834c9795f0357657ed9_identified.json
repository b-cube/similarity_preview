This was the challenge facing University of Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Department of Criminology and their new distance learning MSc in Security, Conflict and International Development (SCID).</p> <p>Head of the Department of Criminology, Professor Adrian Beck explains:</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe understood that our existing distance learning model of printed and online resources didn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt match the needs of students, many of whom are based overseas, on the move and without access to the internet.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p><span class=\"discreet\">Take a look at our video about how and why\\ufffd\\ufffdwe developed the App for our MSc in Security, Conflict and International Development</span><br /><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"304\" scrolling=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYspVOGs2zs?rel=0\" width=\"540\"></iframe></p> <p>The answer was deceptively simple. To reach people working for the UN, government and aid agencies and NGOs in conflict or post-conflict countries, the Department gave all their students an iPad, loaded with a course App containing all their course materials and links to further reading.</p> <p>And the results have been impressive. Since its launch in March 2012, course recruitment is 100% above target, and the Department is planning further similar initiatives. Students using the App have shown that they are accessing more learning materials than before. Retention and failure rates have also improved significantly.</p> <p>Professor Beck continues:</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSince we gave our students the iPads and launched the App-based course, the response has been remarkable \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd they\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre reading more, because they\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre able to.

But with the recent efforts of the Head of our <a class=\"internal-link\" title=\"Criminology\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology\">Department of Criminology</a>, Adrian Beck, and his team of academics, the University is now able to offer a distance learning MSc in <a class=\"internal-link\" title=\"Security, Conflict and International Development MSc/Postgraduate Certificate/Postgraduate Diploma\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/study/postgrad/distance/safetysecurity/conflict\">Security, Conflict and International Development</a> to international development workers who are based in post-conflict countries, or those who are interested in this field of work.</p> <p>The wonders of modern technology mea that the course, which focuses on the skills, knowledge and understanding needed to work in post-conflict countries, is delivered online and via an app downloaded onto an iPad provided by the University. Students can study topics on the move even when they don't have access to the internet, and the delivery is therefore as flexible as possible to meet their needs.</p> <p>The course is particularly well-timed as the multitude of social, political and cultural uprisings in the Middle East means that experts working in countries going through such transitions will be highly sought after. It also means that the University will be able to take a lead in supporting those who already work in these difficult areas and want to help countries emerge from conflicts successfully.</p> <p>The first students signed up last week&nbsp;to the new course&nbsp;which is something of an experiment. If it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds successful, then the template could well be used for other courses to aid distance learning across the University, and drastically change the way students use devices such as the iPad in their studies.</p> <ul><li> <div><a class=\"internal-link\" title=\"University of Leicester takes learning into the heart of conflict zones\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2012/march/university-of-leicester-takes-learning-into-the-heart-of-conflict-zones\">University press release</a></div> </li></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>pt91</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Distance Learning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>E-Learning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Criminology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-15T15:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/november/graduates-in-the-news-shaun-mccormick\">     <title>MBA student featured in the Guardian</title>     <link>http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/november/graduates-in-the-news-shaun-mccormick</link>     <description>Successful entrepreneur with an MBA in his sights.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>A piece in the <em>Guardian</em> last week about the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/nov/14/mba-entrepreneurs-start-up-skills\">increased popularity of MBAs</a> - Master of Business Administration - featured one of our current students, Shaun McCormick, founder of specialist business consultancy <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://tacitpharma.co.uk/\">Tacit Pharma</a>.</p> <p>Shaun is studying for a distance learning MBA with our <a class=\"internal-link\" title=\"Management\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management\">School of Management</a> and has already set up his own company providing consultancy services to the pharmaceutical industry, a sector where he had previously worked as a senior manager.</p> <p>So successful has Tacit been that Shaun has subsequently expanded his business empire into Tacit Recruitment and web design agency Tacit Creations.</p> <p>\"The MBA helped my understanding of all the factors that impact on a business and how best to navigate to grow,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Shaun told the paper. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMy MBA experiences helped me launch, finance and grow the companies, find new markets and customers and create jobs.\"</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Graduates in the news</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Distance Learning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2011-11-21T15:10:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/november/totally-tropical-bringing-the-university-of-leicester-to-the-caribbean\">     <title>Totally tropical: bringing the University of Leicester to the Caribbean</title>     <link>http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/november/totally-tropical-bringing-the-university-of-leicester-to-the-caribbean</link>     <description>School of Management staff visit distance learners on distant islands.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Two academics from our <a class=\"internal-link\" title=\"Management\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/management\">School of Management</a> are currently visiting the West Indies, providing lectures and academic support to current and prospective students of our distance learning management courses in some of the tiny island nations of the Caribbean.</p> <p>Alan Bryman, Professor of Organisational and Social Research, and Dr Bruce Hearn, Lecturer in Finance and Corporate Governance spent a few days this week in <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.stkittstourism.kn/\">St Kitts and Nevis</a>, the smallest sovereign state in the Americas.
