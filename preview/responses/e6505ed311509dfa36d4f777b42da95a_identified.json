The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996.  Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study.  Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination (referred to as the Oyster Biomass Database), and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey).  The first three stages occurred before the first nekton measurement, which was in March 1997.  In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek.  This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass.  In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume.  This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks.  During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated.  The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage.  The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. Nekton samples were taken in March, June, August, and in November of 1997 and 1998, always following the same procedures.  To sample the nekton present in creeks, a block net was set up at the mouth of each creek starting at a daybreak slack high tide on which the flooding level did not exceed the tops of the marsh banks (=bank full).  At low tide, animals in block nets were collected and frozen.  Because each creek contained tidal pools, seines were used to obtain nekton from areas retaining water and nekton at low tide.  Each pool sample was also frozen.  At the time of sampling, additional data such as water temperature, salinity, tidal height and time were recorded.  In the months following, block net and pool samples were thawed and animals were sorted and identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (defined as 'species' in the following description).  Length data [Standard Length (SL) in mm] were obtained for up to 100 individuals in each taxonomic category.  Biomass data were obtained first for the 100 individuals, and then for the entire species sample (total weight for each species).  Species abundance was extrapolated from the total weight when more than 100 individuals were collected.  This procedure was followed for each species in the sample.  For block nets, samples were thawed and split to a manageable volume following the preceding guidelines.  Total species biomass and abundance were extrapolated from subsample data.  Abundance and biomass calculations per cubic meter were determined using the volume estimates for each creek.  See the CREEK Project's Tidal Creek Geomorphology Metadata (Corbett/Humphries GIS Survey) for more information about how the volume estimates for each creek were made. </abstract> <purpose> The CREEK Project nekton sampling program was initiated in 1997 to determine relationships between geomorphological features (including the presence of oysters) and nekton use of intertidal creeks in the North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, South Carolina. </purpose> <supplinf> &gt;               Significant Publications and Presentations: Testing the role of oyster reefs in the structure and function of tidal creeks with a replicated ecosystem scale experiment: system level variability and response to removal of oysters.

Water temperatures variations among creeks at the time of the high tide net set never exceeded 2&#xB0;C.  Salinities were &gt;31 ppt on all 8 sampling dates; seasonal variations were &lt;5 ppt, with slightly lower salinities occurring in March.  Salinity differences among creeks never exceeded 2 ppt on the same date.  Bank full levels of flooding were similar among the first seven dates (March 1997 through August 1998) with less than 20 cm differences being observed.  The water level in November 1998 was substantially higher than the first seven collection dates; it was about 30 cm higher than the average for the other seven dates.  Each creek exceeded bank full status for about 30 minutes around slack tide; however, this higher level was not high enough to allow mixing with adjacent creeks. &gt; &gt;                                 Other Creek Datasets Several other datasets were collected over varying periods during the four years.  Oyster biomass data were collected to determine the natural average biomass of oysters within intertidal creeks so that all creeks could be adjusted to that average level and subsequently to monitor changes in oyster biomass since elucidating the role of oysters was the primary purpose of the overall study.  Intensive planktonic - microbial loop sampling and experiments were conducted in selected creeks at various times.  Oyster growth was measured monthly during the same period of nekton collections.  Infection intensities of the oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, were made in fall of the pre-manipulation year and once following the manipulation.  See the Creek Project Overview documentation for information on publications, presentations, and other undergraduate and graduate research project topics. &gt; &gt;                       Summary of important results: Although covering 25-70% (avg.40%) of intertidal creek bottoms, oysters do not dominate faunal biomass or the remineralization of nutrients. Totally unexpected was the finding that summer nekton (fishes, shrimps, crabs) biomass is higher than oyster biomass. Nekton prefer certain creeks to others and these distributions are related to creek shape, mean depth, flooding and discharge rate, and distance to upland ridge, but not creek size (volume, area, or length). A tag / recapture study by a student found that pinfish migrated into flooding creeks but did not move among creeks. El Ni&amp;ntilde;o, a global environmental event, was clearly evident from the analysis of three years of weekly chlorophyll and nutrient data (1997-2000). Utilizing limited literature values and preliminary experiments, a simple budget for ammonium indicated that nekton inputs were considerably greater than oyster excretion as a source to intertidal creeks.

Irregular bottom shape, oyster rubble, and muddy substrate in which animals could hide and avoid the net, decreased the efficiency of collections in the pools.  No efficiency tests were done to determine how efficient the sampling was for the block nets or the pool seining.  However, the gear and technique used was very consistently from creek to creek, but not from pool to pool. Total catch biomass measurements for each creek using the large hanging scale was accurate to plus or minus 15g (based on calibration study of scales on June 2, 1998), and the top loading electronic balance which was used for weighing each species was accurate to plus or minus 0.1gram.  Samples were not measured and weighed the same day they were collected or sorted.  These samples were originally frozen several months before being thawed and sorted into species groups.  At this time, samples were refrozen for several days before being re-thawed, measured, and weighed.  No length or weight comparisons between fresh collected samples versus this technique were done during the study, but it is reasonable to estimate that the loss of weight from freezer dehydration was no more than 10%.  As a result, the accuracy of total biomass was plus or minus 15g plus 10% of the total weight value. The accuracy of species identification was very high.  Most of the nekton were identified to species level, while few animals were only identified to genus.  When the genus name plus the use of \"sp.\" (to designate the species name) was used, it indicated that no more than one species occurred in the sorted catch.  The use of \"spp.\" was used when more than one species occurred.  Typically, only two or three species made up the \"spp.\" category: Anchoa spp. = Anchoa mitchilli, A. hepsetus, and unidentified anchovies (A. mitchilli and hepsetus) Paralichthys spp. = Paralichthys dentatus and P. lethostigma; rarely P. albigutta Caranx spp. = primarily composed of Caranx hippos and less commonly C. latus Syngnathus spp. = Syngnathus floridae, S. fuscus, and S. louisianae Prionotus spp. = Prionotus carolinus, P. evolans, .P scitulus, and P. tribulus Cynoscion spp. = Cynoscion nebulosus and C. regalis. Lutjanus spp. = Lutjanus griseus and L. synagris Astroscopus spp. = Astroscopus guttatus and A. y-graecum Symphurus spp. = primarily composed of Symphurus plagiusa.

Investigators estimate that escapement for blocknets was consistently less than 5%.  But since the gear and technique was very consistent from creek to creek, the variability from this should be equal among all data, and the variability among data values is due to natural causes.  Pool sampling accuracy was not estimated. ABUNDANCE &amp; BIOMASS values are the result of dividing an abundance and biomass value by the creek volume and are reported with one decimal place.  This does not imply that they are accurate to one decimal place, but is a result of the calculation. Within the Abundance and Biomass Excel Spreadsheet on the Abundance worksheet tab, there are values listed as 0.0; however, most of these values actually represent a very small number and not zero.  The values were rounded to one decimal place so that is why the values appear as 0.0. The pool catch data for creeks 4 and 8 on 3/22/97, 3/12/98, 6/20/97, 8/16/97, and 11/15/97 were extrapolated from the ratio of pool data to stopnet data from the 11/3/98 sample data for the corresponding creeks.  November 1998 data was used because the freezer, which stored the unprocessed samples, malfunctioned and the samples were lost.  The pool catch data for creeks 1-3 and 5-7 on 3/22/97; were extrapolated from the ratio of pool data to stopnet data from the 3/12/98 collection data.  If a particular species occurred during one year, but not in the other, the number of species was not extrapolated.  The pool data has the most estimations and extrapolations in it, but the investigators worked very hard to ensure the values were within reasonable limits for each creek/month/year. Within the directory NEKTON.ORIGINAL.FINAL/Bioabun2002/CREEKfinalabandancesummaryDec02: Atlantic stingray abundance in Creek 5 on 11/15/1997 was listed as 0.0; however the Data Manager verified the value and it should be 0.0022.

The Rescue data manager verified that the correct date is August 16, 1997 by looking at the original nekton printouts; this correction was made in the data contained in the NEKTON.RESCUE2004.PROCESS and NEKTON.RESCUE2004.FINAL directories.  No change was made to any of the ORIGINAL files. In the File: NEKTON.ORIGINAL.FINAL/Bioabun2001/databiomass/biomass32297: the title for column E is an Estimate for Creek # total pool based on SN/Total pool ratio (3/22/97); however the date should be 3/12/98.  Further, this applies to creeks 1-3 and 5-7 in biomass32297 and the date for creeks 4 and 8 should be 11/3/98.

The reasoning for this was based on the assumption that all transient species in the creeks would move out into the larger subtidal creeks and would be collected in the stopnet.  It was later determined that some transient species were influenced by the presence of the stopnet and would \"hold-up\" in the pools to avoid being captured in the stopnet.  Therefore, pool sampling became a part of the regular creek nekton sampling for the rest of study. Raw grass shrimp datasheets, for Palaemonetes pugio and Palaemonetes vulgaris, exist for March 1997 and June 1997; however, datasheets do not exist for these species for rest of the sampling dates.  It was determined that the bulk of the shrimp collected were P. pugio; however, all grass shrimp data are combined in a category named Palaemonetes spp. &gt; &gt;                               Anomalous Data: Directory: NEKTON.RESCUE2004.PROCESS/Graphics: Within the March 1997 and 1998 biomass and abundance data, brown shrimp and white shrimp were not graphed because the totals were zero.  Also, within the August and November 1997 and 1998 biomass and abundance data, brown shrimp was not graphed because the totals were zero. </complete> <lineage> <method> <methtype>Field Collection Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Overall Field Collection Protocol Nekton seasonal abundance and biomass were determined for each creek and every creek pool.  Simultaneous collections of nekton were made with block nets set at early morning slack high tide at all eight creek mouths.  Funnel-shaped block nets (3 mm mesh) were used, and they were similar to those designed by Bozeman and Dean (1980).  The block nets were mounted on rectangular PVC frames (2m x 1.6m) which fit into permanently installed wooden and plastic mesh infrastructure that oriented the net perpendicular to the creek and prevented nekton from escaping from the creek once the net was set in place at high tide.  The block net system covered the wet cross-sectional area near the mouth of each tidal creek.  Only tides with high tide heights less than bankfull were sampled in order to reduce the chance of exchange with other creeks at high water.  Only tides that were predicted to fall to mean low water levels, thus completely draining the creeks (except for residual pools), were sampled.  Since the nets were always set shortly after daybreak, the creeks loaded during the dark period.  At low tide, catches were removed from the block nets, and nekton remaining within pools were seined and added to the catch to provide a complete assessment of nekton (fish and motile macroinvertebrates) occupying the creek.  The seines (3 mm mesh) were sufficiently long to cover all submerged bottoms.  All samples were frozen.  Since pool collections were not made in March 1997, proportionalities were used from the corresponding 1998 collections to estimate pool biomass and abundance for those dates.  To investigate the role of oyster reefs on nekton, live oysters were removed from creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8 in January 1997.  In 1998, all eight creeks were again sampled for nekton, following the same procedures established in 1997.  Water temperature, salinity, and depth measurements were collected when the nets were set in the morning and again at the time of sample retrieval that afternoon. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>E.L.

Most animals were identified by genus and species; however some were identified only to the genus level.  Sample collection processing followed North Inlet Long-Term Ecological Research Nekton protocols set in 1981 (Allen et al., 1992). Limnoterra's Electronic Fish Measuring Board (FMB) was used to obtain Standard Length (SL) data, to the nearest 2 mm, for each member of a species up to 100 individuals.  Biomass (in grams) data were obtained first for the 100 individuals, and then for the entire species sample.  Species abundance was then determined by FMB by calculation.  This procedure was completed for each species in the pool sample.  For block nets, samples were thawed and sub-sampled following the preceding guidelines.  Total species biomass and abundance were extrapolated from sub-sample data using the FMB.  Total abundances and biomasses were converted to densities by dividing each value by the calculated volume of water in the creek at high tide.  These values were expressed as number of individuals per cubic meter and grams wet weight per cubic meter. Refer to the CREEK Project's: Tidal Creek Geomorphology and Creek Habitat Survey databases to look at how the volume of water in each creek was calculated. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Dennis Allen</origin> <origin>Susan Service</origin> <origin>Ginger Ogburn-Matthews</origin> <origin>Belle W.

From each sample, up to 100 individuals of each species was measured (SL) to the nearest 2 mm by the FMB.  Weight of 100 and total weight of each species was entered into FMB and total number was calculated by FMB software.  Printout of each species entry was made.  Each species length data and weight was stored into an ASCII text file.  All hardcopy datasheets were kept in individual sample files.  Biomass and abundance by date per species data were transferred into MS Excel spreadsheets, verified, edited and finalized; therefore, there are separate biomass files and abundance files for each date.  Each creek with its pool data were entered on separate sheets within the Excel workbook of each date.  Once in Excel form, all files were backed up on floppy disk, zip disk and CD.  Length data were derived from the FMB file, and were also imported into an Excel spreadsheet, edited and verified. &gt; &gt;    Abundance &amp; Biomass Extrapolation Calculations to Create Pool Values (The Rescue Data Manager in 2004 derived these formulas from the Excel Files in the Directory: Original Final.

The same month of each year was grouped together in Excel, i.e. March data from 1997 and 1998 was placed together on the same Excel worksheet tab.  Pool data were reviewed and errors in the files were corrected as noted in the above paragraphs.  The Pool extrapolation equations were also determined and documented in the aboved documentation.  The species categories used for final graphing were anchovy, Atlantic silverside, blue crab, brown shrimp, grass shrimp, mummichog, pinfish, spot, striped mullet, white mullet, white shrimp, and others.  The others category contains the remaining nekton species that did not fall into the main categories.  These species categories were chosen based on the CREEK Project's Nekton manuscript by Dennis Allen et al. which is currently in preparation.  Bar graphs for each month, which included both years, were created using Excel. All final documentation, graphics, and data were printed out in hardcopy and placed into the CREEK Project's 3-ring binder; the digital version of the final products are also kept on Baruch's Web Site.  The 3-ring binder and the web site are maintained at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL) in Georgetown, SC.  Also, all of the rescue products for the Nekton database which include raw data and scans of raw data sheets were copied to Compact Disk; one set of the CDs are kept with the hardcopy printouts and the other set is kept in the fireproof cabinet in the Data Manager's Office at the BMFL.

See each subproject's metadata for details.  But, there were some names and meanings common to the entire Creek project. Creek = The numbering identification of each tidal creek within North Inlet Estuary where water samples were collected; creeks 1-4 were creeklets running into Clambank Creek; creeks 5-8 were creeklets running into Town Creek.  See map for creek numbering and location within North Inlet Estuary (located in the Supplemental Information). Date = The date on which the sample was collected (not necessarily processed or analyzed) in m/d/yyyy format. &gt; &gt;  The following terms are found within the original raw scanned documents: Species Code = number assigned to a specific species (see list below) Pool Number = number assigned to pools within each creek. (i.e. number 1 was closest to mouth of creek) SN = stop net (used in the collection of nekton).  Synonymous with \"blocknet\" &gt; &gt;The following terms are found within either the original final or the rescue &gt;             process or the rescue final MS Excel files: Abundance = Total number of individuals per cubic meter (#/m3) Biomass = Grams of wet weight for each species per cubic meter (g/ m3) Note: The cubic meters (m3) are based on the volume of the creek (including tributaries) at bank full tide level. Calculations were based on survey measurements of creek length, width, and depth at bank full. Creek # = The Creek #'s were abbreviated to C1 for Creek #1, and this is consistent for all 8 creeks. Others = The others category contains the sum of the remaining nekton species that did not fall into the main categories of anchovy, Atlantic silverside, blue crab, brown shrimp, grass shrimp, mummichog, pinfish, spot, striped mullet, white mullet, and white shrimp. Dry wt/ m3 = Grams of dry weight for each species per cubic meter (g/ m3).  The values were not derived directly during this study, but from literature values. Habitat = refers to where the nekton are located.  Nekton are characterized by being either demersal or water column. Total Catch per species = total biomass or abundance by species for a creek, including stop net and pools. Total Biomass = total biomass of both demersal and water column by pool and by stop net. Total Creek Biomass = total biomass by creek.
