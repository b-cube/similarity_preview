This talk describes research in which children aged four and five years were given a digital camera to photograph their visit around a natural history museum. The photographs and discussions with the children revealed aspects of their visit that were unknown to their parents, and gave insights into the ways in which the children made sense of the museum objects, from eggs to dinosaurs.</p> <p>The lecture will be illustrated by the children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds photographs. The Lunchtime Lecture series takes place Fridays, 12-1pm at the Leicester Adult Education College, located at 2 Wellington St, near the city end of New Walk.

Drawing on a study with socio-economically disadvantaged, minority-ethnic community groups and families and another study with students from inner-London schools, I will discuss how their museum visit experiences were disadvantageous in ways that were particularly marked by ethnicity, class and gender. In other words, getting people \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthrough the door\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd did not necessarily mean they were included. Instead the visits raised significant issues about how resources such as museums play a part in the reproduction of social advantage &amp; disadvantage. Finally, in an attempt to finish without totally depressing everyone, I will discuss what a framework for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinclusive\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd practice might look like and am really interested to hear what other people think about it.\"</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>User Submitted</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>College:Arts</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Event:Lecture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-05-06T12:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>UoL Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/may/belsen-1945\">     <title>'Belsen, 1945'</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/may/belsen-1945</link>     <description>Main Hall, Fraser Noble Building. -
