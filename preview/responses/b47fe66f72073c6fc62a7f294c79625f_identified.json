These networks are a real world example of a collective that shares ICT resources. But while these community networks successfully achieve the IP connectivity over the shared network infrastructure, the deployment of applications inside of community networks is surprisingly low. Given that community networks are driven by volunteers, we believe that bringing in incentive-based mechanisms for service and application deployments in community networks will help in unlocking its true potential. We investigate in this paper such mechanisms to steer user contributions, in order to provide cloud services from within community networks. From the analysis of the community network&amp;#39;s topology, we derive two scenarios of community clouds, the local cloud and the federated cloud. We develop an architecture tailored to community networks which integrates the incentive mechanism we propose. In simulations of large scale community cloud scenarios we study the behaviour of the incentive mechanism in different configurations, where slices of homogeneous virtual machine instances are shared. Our simulation results allow us to understand better how to configure such an incentive mechanism in a future prototype of a real community cloud system, which ultimately should lead to realisation of clouds in community networks.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/288535</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/317879</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:7472</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:38:31Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-clommunity</setSpec><setSpec>user-confine</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Buyuksahin, Umit C</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Khan, Amin M</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Freitag, Felix</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Support Service for Reciprocal Computational Resource Sharing in Wireless Community Networks</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-06-04</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/7472</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1109/WoWMoM.2013.6583482</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;In community networks, individuals and local organizations from a geographic area team up to create and run a community-owned IP network to satisfy the community&amp;#39;s demand for ICT, such as facilitating Internet access and providing services of local interest. Most current community networks use wireless links for the node interconnection, applying off-the-shelf wireless equipment. While IP connectivity over the shared network infrastructure is successfully achieved, the deployment of applications in community networks is surprisingly low. To address the solution of this problem, we propose in this paper a service to incentivize the contribution of computing and storage as cloud resources to community networks, in order to stimulate the deployment of services and applications.

While the IP connectivity of the networking devices is successfully achieved, the number of services and applications available from within the community network is typically small and the usage of the community network is often limited to providing Internet access to remote areas through wireless links. In this paper we propose to apply the principle of resource sharing of community networks, currently limited to the network bandwidth, to other computing resources, which leads to cloud computing in community networks. Towards this vision, we review some characteristics of community networks and identify potential scenarios for community clouds. We simulate a cloud computing infrastructure service and discuss different aspects of its performance in comparison to a commercial centralized cloud system. We note that in community clouds the computing resources are heterogeneous and less powerful, which affects the time needed to assign resources. Response time of the infrastructure service is high in community clouds even for a small number of resources since resources are distributed, but tends to get closer to that of a centralized cloud when the number of resources requested increases. Our initial results suggest that the performance of the community clouds highly depends on the community network conditions, but has some potential for improvement with network-aware cloud services. The main strength compared to commercial cloud services, however, is that community cloud services hosted on community-owned resources will follow the principles of community network and will be neutral and open.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/317879</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/288535</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:7614</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:39:02Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-clommunity</setSpec><setSpec>user-confine</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Jimenez, Javi</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Baig, Roger</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Escrich, Pau</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Khan, Amin M</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Freitag, Felix</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Navarro, Leandro</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Pietrosemoli, Ermanno</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Zennaro, Marco</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Payberah, Amir H</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Vlassov, Vladimir</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Supporting Cloud Deployment in the Guifi.net Community Network</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-10-30</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/7614</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.7614</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Community networking is an emerging model of a shared communication infrastructure in which communities of citizens build and own open networks.

This sharing, however, has not extended to computing and storage resources, resulting in very few applications and services which are currently deployed within community networks. Cloud computing, as in today&amp;#39;s Internet, has made it common to consume resources provided by public clouds providers, but such cloud infrastructures have not materialized within community networks. We analyse in this paper socio-technical characteristics of community networks in order to derive scenarios for community clouds. Based on an architecture for such a community cloud, we implement a prototype for the incentive-driven resource assignment component, deploy it in a testbed of community network nodes, and evaluate its behaviour experimentally. Our evaluation gives insight into how the deployed prototype components regulate the consumption of cloud resources taking into account the users&amp;#39; contributions, and how this regulation affects the system usage. Our results suggest a further integration of this regulation component into current cloud management platforms in order to open them up for the operation of an ecosystem of community cloud.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/288535</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/317879</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8461</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-12T18:06:01Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-clommunity</setSpec><setSpec>user-confine</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Estrich, Pau</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Baig, Roger</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Vilalta, Ivan</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Neumann, Axel</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Aymerich, Marc</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Lopez, Ester</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Vega, Davide</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Meseguer, Roc</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Freitag, Felix</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Navarro, Leandro</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Community Home Gateways for P2P Clouds</dc:title>   <dc:date>2013-09-11</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8461</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1109/P2P.2013.6688732</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;P2P based clouds built with low-end devices and voluntarily contributed resources have been proposed by several authors. While some work was published on architectures and decentralized P2P-based mechanisms for such clouds, yet no complete system has been presented which implements such cloud systems without important limitations. We present the community home gateway, a computer system attached to a wireless community network router, able to host platform and application services. Different to current home gateways and other low-end systems, the community home gateway offers resource virtualization, and can thus be used as cloud resource. The community home gateway removes the lack of a system open for service contributions and therefore constitutes an important step towards building P2P clouds with low-end devices. While we present the community home gateway as being part of a P2P community cloud, the applications scenarios of the system that can be imagined go beyond community networks.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8575</identifier><datestamp>2014-07-01T12:24:25Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-clommunity</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Khan, Amin M</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Freitag, Felix</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Exploring the Role of Macroeconomic Mechanisms in Voluntary Resource Provisioning in Community Network Clouds</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-06-04</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8575</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1007/978-3-319-07593-8_32</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Internet and communication technologies have lowered the costs of enabling individuals and communities to collaborate together.

The controller automatically resizes an elastic service in response to changes in workload, in order to meet Service Level Objectives (SLOs) at a reduced cost. However, variable performance of Cloud Virtual Machines and nonlinearities in Cloud services, such as the diminishing reward of adding a service instance with increasing the scale, complicates the controller design. We present the design and evaluation of ElastMan, an elasticity controller for Cloud-based elastic key-value stores. ElastMan combines feedforward and feedback control. Feedforward control is used to respond to spikes in the workload by quickly resizing the service to meet SLOs at a minimal cost. Feedback control is used to correct modeling errors and to handle diurnal workload. To address nonlinearities, our design of ElastMan leverages the near-linear scalability of elastic Cloud services in order to build a scale-independent model of the service. We have implemented and evaluated ElastMan using the Voldemort key-value store running in an OpenStack Cloud environment. Our evaluation shows the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach to automation of Cloud service elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/317879</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12507</identifier><datestamp>2015-01-09T08:11:35Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-clommunity</setSpec><setSpec>user-confine</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>ADCAIJ: Advances in Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence Journal: 3 (2014) no. 8, </dc:source>   <dc:creator>Khan, Amin M</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Freitag, Felix</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Sparks in the Fog: Social and Economic Mechanisms as Enablers for Community Network Clouds</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-10-15</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12507</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.14201/ADCAIJ201438112</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Internet and communication technologies have lowered the costs of enabling individuals and communities to collaborate together.

We indicate socio-economic policies and how they can be implemented in community networks, to ease the uptake and ensure the sustainability of community clouds.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/288535</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/317879</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12596</identifier><datestamp>2015-01-09T08:11:35Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-clommunity</setSpec><setSpec>user-confine</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Khan, Amin M</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Selimi, Mennan</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Freitag, Felix</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Towards Distributed Architecture for Collaborative Cloud Services in Community Networks</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-09-10</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12596</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.12596</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;Internet and communication technologies have lowered the costs for communities to collaborate, leading to new services like user-generated content and social computing, and through collaboration, collectively built infrastructures like community networks have also emerged. Community networks get formed when individuals and local organisations from a geographic area team up to create and run a community-owned IP network to satisfy the community&amp;#39;s demand for ICT, such as facilitating Internet access and providing services of local interest. The consolidation of today&amp;#39;s cloud technologies offers now the possibility of collectively built community clouds, building upon user-generated content and user-provided networks towards an ecosystem of cloud services. To address the limitation and enhance utility of community networks, we propose a collaborative distributed architecture for building a community cloud system that employs resources contributed by the members of the community network for provisioning infrastructure and software services. Such architecture needs to be tailored to the specific social, economic and technical characteristics of the community networks for community clouds to be successful and sustainable. By real deployments of clouds in community networks and evaluation of application performance, we show that community clouds are feasible. Our result may encourage collaborative innovative cloud-based services made possible with the resources of a community.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/317879</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/288535</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><resumptionToken cursor=\"0\" completeListSize=\"13\" expirationDate=\"2015-03-13T23:16:33Z\">user-clommunity___7pRicW</resumptionToken></ListRecords> </OAI-PMH>  ",
