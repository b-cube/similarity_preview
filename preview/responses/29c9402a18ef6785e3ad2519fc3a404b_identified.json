A total of 28-55 yellowedge have been captured (n=238) during each cruise from 1999-2004. A thorough reproductive study requires samples collected from each month of the year, however, NMFS cruises are only conducted in July through September. Therefore, collaboration with a commercial fisherman, Ken Daniels, Jr., was established to collect an adequate number of samples for a successful and conclusive study. The objective of this study was to sample additional yellowedge grouper and combine those samples with fishery independent samples already collected by the NMFS to determine the life history of yellowedge in the northern GOM. This document summarizes the data collected by Ken Daniels, Jr. under this cooperative research agreement. A comprehensive analysis will be found in \"Life history, population structure, mortality and potential yield of the yellowedge grouper, Epinephelus flavolimbatus, from the northern Gulf of Mexico\" by Melissa Cook, a doctoral candidate at the University of Southern Mississippi.  </dcterms:abstract>    <dc:publisher>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</dc:publisher>    <dc:creator>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</dc:creator>    <dc:identifier xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/20413</dc:identifier>    <dcterms:isPartOf xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/9306</dcterms:isPartOf>    <dcterms:references xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                         https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/21515</dcterms:references>    <dcterms:references xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                         https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/21489</dcterms:references>    <dcterms:temporal xsi:type=\"dcterms:Period\">                             start=2003-06-01;                             end=2006-05-31;                         </dcterms:temporal>    <dcterms:accessRights>The project data is not available for online viewing or downloading.</dcterms:accessRights> </metadata> ",
