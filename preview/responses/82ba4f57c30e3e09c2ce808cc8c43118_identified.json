We attempt to answer the question of what makes a development initiative successful by comparing the decent work approach to the United Nation Development Program's (UNDP) human development concept (in conjunction with the human development indicator). We consider that the latter has been one of the most successful development concepts ever to have been launched, while the impact of decent work by comparison has been limited.&#13; Our hypothesis relating to the question of what makes a development initiative successful has three fundamental components: first, a solid theoretical foundation has to justify the launch of a development concept. A second vital factor is the availability of sufficient national and internationally comparable data that enables researchers and policymakers alike to apply the concept, preferably by means of a synthetic indicator. Third, the political will and institutional structure of the development institution that launches a concept is a key factor, particularly if data availability is limited as countries then have to be persuaded to generate new data.

In identifying three critical areas in which civic media and NGOs are translating social programmes to strengthen concepts of citizenship through cooperative action -  information provision, advocacy and education - this study argues that they are contributing to the development of a strong new media space in the form of citizen radios. These, often web-based broadcasters, provide opportunities, particularly for youth in both provincial and urban areas, to develop capacities as producers, consumers and story subjects, offering them new tools to experiment with blogging, citizen journalism, social messaging and identity building. The partnership of these two sectors provides significant benefits in terms of funding provision, democracy promotion and capacity building, although, it is argued, they can also place limits on the independence and future growth of these citizen radio platforms. The message, financing, and regulation of this growing field of civil society/ citizen radio output remains at the centre of a continuous negotiation of powers shifting to the public sphere.

A detailed discussion of the various administrative bodies, created and run by civilian actors and responsible for the provision of the basic services for a population of 2 million people, will reveal the emergence of a governance model centred on the role of the city council and its constituent medical, relief, services and information offices. This civilian administration model, similar to the one implemented in the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdliberated\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd areas in the Aleppo and Idlib governorates, is considered by many civilians and members of the opposition as an embodiment of the original principles of the Syrian revolution because of its commitment to moderate Islamic values and a transparent electoral process, as demonstrated by the January 2014 electrons in East Ghouta. As such, it offers an alternative to the governance models of Bashar al-Assad and the Islamic State, implemented in other parts of Syria. However, even though the civilian administration in East Ghouta has repeatedly illustrated its resilience to external attacks and adaptability vis-\\ufffd\\ufffd-vis the deteriorating humanitarian situation, the obstacles to its survival have multiplied. In addition to the violent attempts of the regime and IS to take over this territory, the encroachment of armed groups on the activities of the civilian actors, the exhaustion of medical and food supplies, and the difficulty in standardising the governance structures on the local and provincial level have proved to be some of the overwhelming challenges to the governance model in East Ghouta that, until today, continue to question the endurance of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdliberated\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd territories around Damascus. </description> <dc:date>2014-10-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246119\"> <title>Advocacy Organizations\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Evaluation of Social Media Information for NGO Journalism: The Evidence and Engagement Models</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246119</link> <description>Advocacy Organizations\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Evaluation of Social Media Information for NGO Journalism: The Evidence and Engagement Models McPherson, Ella This article contributes to the emergent literature on the use of social media at advocacy organizations; while much of this literature focuses on how these organizations produce social media information, this article explores the complementary and relatively unexamined practice of how advocacy organizations consume social media information, particularly with respect to how they evaluate it as part of that consumption process. The article develops two theoretical models of how advocacy organizations evaluate social media information. These models differ according to the information values at their cores and according to how these values are evaluated; correspondingly the models interact differently with social media\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds affordances. The key information value for the evidence model is the veracity of the information\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds metadata, and this is largely evaluated through a time intensive corroboration process drawing on human expertise. In contrast, the key information value pertaining to the engagement model is participation, evaluated by measuring the volume of participants in the information\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds production and transmission. In sum, the affordances of social media are often hindrances for the evidence model, as they can make metadata more difficult to verify. On the other hand, the engagement model builds on social media affordances, as these affordances facilitate participation and the evaluation of participant volume using digital analytics. In addition to shedding light on approaches to social media information evaluation at advocacy organizations, this article urge researchers and practitioners to keep their eyes peeled for barriers to pluralism as they use and study these approaches.
