The GRACE data also evidence westward propagation that is consistent with the behavior of long mode-1 Rossby waves at this latitude, with phase increasing from east to west at a rate of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.34m s\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 1. The ECCO and LRWM pb estimates corroborate the notion that GRACE reveals the pb signature of annual Rossby waves driven by interior wind stress curl and possibly damped by frictional processes. Results have implications for attempts to constrain global ocean mass using a single point mooring. This article is protected by copyright.

Salinity and air-sea freshwater flux changes in the NPSG are all closely related to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating the large-scale ocean-atmosphere interaction.

This enabled us to estimate vertical nutrient fluxes and the impact of different types of turbulent mixing on biological activity.

This enabled us to estimate vertical nutrient fluxes and the impact of different types of turbulent mixing on biological activity.

We found a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.73, p&lt;0.005) between POC export flux and the fraction of diatom in the coastal area, indicating that POC export flux in this province is driven by large phytoplankton, in particular, diatoms. In the shelf area, a relatively strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.54, p&lt;0.0001) was noted for POC export flux and POC stock in the euphotic zone. This indicates that POC export flux in the South China Sea shelf is primarily controlled by POC stock. In contrast, in the South China Sea basin, the correlations of both POC export flux vs. POC stock and POC export flux vs. phytoplankton community structure are weak. This suggests that mechanisms controlling POC export flux in the South China Sea basin are complicated and factors other than POC stock and phytoplankton community structure may exert a predominant effect on POC export flux in this region.

We found a strong correlation (R2=0.73, p&lt;0.005) between POC export flux and the fraction of diatom in the coastal area, indicating that POC export flux in this province is driven by large phytoplankton, in particular, diatoms. In the shelf area, a relatively strong correlation (R2=0.54, p&lt;0.0001) was noted for POC export flux and POC stock in the euphotic zone. This indicates that POC export flux in the South China Sea shelf is primarily controlled by POC stock. In contrast, in the South China Sea basin, the correlations of both POC export flux vs. POC stock and POC export flux vs. phytoplankton community structure are weak. This suggests that mechanisms controlling POC export flux in the South China Sea basin are complicated and factors other than POC stock and phytoplankton community structure may exert a predominant effect on POC export flux in this region.

On the other hand, we observed higher AT relative to salinity in the freshwater end-member in the mild and rainy winter of 2012 (1142 \\ufffd\\ufffdmol kg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1) compared to AT in 2013 (526 \\ufffd\\ufffdmol kg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1). Observations of calcite and dolomite crystals in the glacial ice suggested supply of carbonate-rich glacial drainage water to the fjord. This implies that winters with a large amount of glacial drainage water partly provide a lessening of further ocean acidification, which will also affect the air-sea CO2 exchange.

Large replenishment in 2013 was primarily from CAAMYI-Oct-1 attributed to strongly negative SAT and Qtotal anomalies and strongly positive albedo that impeded melt. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010567\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Cross-shelf exchange in the shelf of the East China Sea</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010567</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Cross-shelf exchange in the shelf of the East China Sea</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Feng Zhou, Huijie Xue, Daji Huang, Jiliang Xuan, Xiaobo Ni, Peng Xiu, Qiang Hao</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-03-12T10:59:31.421758-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2014JC010567</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2014JC010567</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010567</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Article</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">Abstract</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>A high-resolution, 3-dimensional primitive equation model is used to investigate the cross-shelf exchange in the East China Sea (ECS).

This analysis demonstrates that by properly accounting for the dynamics of the eddy field, a more complete statistical description including nonlinear terms can be obtained from readily available observations. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC009995\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Overturning circulation that ventilates the intermediate layer of the Sea of Okhotsk and the North Pacific: The role of salinity advection</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC009995</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Overturning circulation that ventilates the intermediate layer of the Sea of Okhotsk and the North Pacific: The role of salinity advection</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Junji Matsuda, Humio Mitsudera, Tomohiro Nakamura, Yuichiro Sasajima, Hiroyasu Hasumi, Masaaki Wakatsuchi</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-03-06T09:00:03.423744-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2014JC009995</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2014JC009995</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC009995</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Article</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">Abstract</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation in the northwestern continental shelf of the Sea of Okhotsk is the beginning of the lower limb of the overturning circulation that ventilates the intermediate layer of the North Pacific Ocean.

Sediment oxygen demand causes the region on the Washington coast to be susceptible to hypoxia and is correlated to the broad area of shallow shelf (&lt;60 m) in the region. Respiration and circulation-driven divergence contribute similar (60, 40%, respectively) amounts to the integrated oxygen budget on the Washington coast while respiration dominates the Oregon coast. Divergence, or circulation, contributes to the oxygen dynamics on the shelf in two ways: first, through the generation of retention features, and second, by determining variability. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010395\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Spatial and temporal variability of freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010395</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Spatial and temporal variability of freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">D.

The signal saturation problem of <em>VH</em>, if it exists, occurs at a much higher wind speed compared to the copolarization (copol: <em>VV</em> or <em>HH</em>) sea returns. These properties make <em>VH</em> a better choice over <em>VV</em> or <em>HH</em> for monitoring severe weather. Combined with high spatial resolution of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the development of hurricane wind retrieval using <em>VH</em> is advancing rapidly. This paper describes a cross-pol C-band radar backscattering geophysical model function (GMF) with incidence angle dependence for the full wind speed range in the available data sets (up to 56 m/s). The GMF is derived from RADARSAT-2 (R2) dual-polarization (dual-pol) ScanSAR modes with 300 and 500 km swaths. The proposed GMF is compared to other published algorithms.

The signal saturation problem of VH, if it exists, occurs at a much higher wind speed compared to the copolarization (copol: VV or HH) sea returns. These properties make VH a better choice over VV or HH for monitoring severe weather. Combined with high spatial resolution of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the development of hurricane wind retrieval using VH is advancing rapidly. This paper describes a cross-pol C-band radar backscattering geophysical model function (GMF) with incidence angle dependence for the full wind speed range in the available data sets (up to 56 m/s). The GMF is derived from RADARSAT-2 (R2) dual-polarization (dual-pol) ScanSAR modes with 300 and 500 km swaths. The proposed GMF is compared to other published algorithms. The result shows that the simulated VH cross section and the retrieved wind speed with the proposed GMF is in better agreement with measurements. With careful treatment of noise, the VH-retrieved wind speeds may extend to mild or moderate conditions. The higher fraction of non-Bragg contribution in VH can be exploited for analysis of surface wave breaking. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010059\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>The role of turbulent mixing in the modified Shelf Water overflows that produce Cape Darnley Bottom Water</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010059</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">The role of turbulent mixing in the modified Shelf Water overflows that produce Cape Darnley Bottom Water</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Daisuke Hirano, Yujiro Kitade, Kay I.

The results suggest that the model can be a valuable tool for the accurate observation of sea surface currents. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010025\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Wave breaking and turbulence at a tidal inlet</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010025</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Wave breaking and turbulence at a tidal inlet</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Seth Zippel, Jim Thomson</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-02-19T01:32:37.181728-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2014JC010025</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2014JC010025</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010025</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Article</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">1016</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">1031</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">Abstract</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Field measurements collected with surface drifters at New River Inlet (NC, USA) are used to characterize wave breaking and turbulence in the presence of currents.

The main conclusions of this study are that (a) Aquarius satellite salinity measurements reveal the heretofore unknown proliferation, structure, and variability of surface salinity fronts, and that (b) the fine-scale structures of the SF in the tropical Pacific yield important new information on the regional air-sea interaction and the upper ocean dynamics. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010501\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>An approach to estimate the freshwater contribution from glacial melt and precipitation in East Greenland shelf waters using colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010501</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">An approach to estimate the freshwater contribution from glacial melt and precipitation in East Greenland shelf waters using colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Colin A.

The resulting superresolved sea-surface temperature images are then used to estimate the three-dimensional velocity field in the upper ocean on scales of 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd50 km. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010312\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Nodal variations and long-term changes in the main tides on the coasts of China</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010312</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Nodal variations and long-term changes in the main tides on the coasts of China</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Xiangbo Feng, Michael N.

Notwithstanding its importance, relatively little is known about the structure and transport of this current system and its seasonal and interannual variability. Here we use historical hydrographic data from 1992 to 2008, combined with AVISO satellite altimetry, to diagnose the mean properties as well as seasonal and interannual variability of the boundary current system. We find that while the surface, fresh, cold West Greenland Current is amplified in summer, the subsurface warm, salty Irminger Current has maximum transport in winter, when its waters are also warmer and saltier. Seasonal changes in the total transport are thus mostly due to changes in the baroclinic structure of the current.

Notwithstanding its importance, relatively little is known about the structure and transport of this current system and its seasonal and interannual variability. Here we use historical hydrographic data from 1992 to 2008, combined with AVISO satellite altimetry, to diagnose the mean properties as well as seasonal and interannual variability of the boundary current system. We find that while the surface, fresh, cold West Greenland Current is amplified in summer, the subsurface warm, salty Irminger Current has maximum transport in winter, when its waters are also warmer and saltier. Seasonal changes in the total transport are thus mostly due to changes in the baroclinic structure of the current. By contrast, we find a trend toward warmer/saltier waters and a slowdown of the WGCS, within the period studied. The latter is attributed to changes in the barotropic component of the current. Superimposed on this trend, warm and salty anomalies transit through the system in 1997 and 2003 and are associated with a rapid increase in the transport of the boundary current due to changes in the baroclinic component. The boundary current changes precede similar changes in the interior with a 1\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2 year lag, indicating that anomalies advected into the region by the boundary current can play an important role in the modulation of convection in the Labrador Sea. </description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010378\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>A semianalytical model for sheet flow layer thickness with application to the swash zone</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014JC010378</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">A semianalytical model for sheet flow layer thickness with application to the swash zone</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Thijs Lanckriet, Jack A.

It was found that waves shifted the BRTMs downward and seaward in the beach, and subsequently they engendered different biochemical conditions within the beach. </description></item></rdf:RDF>",
