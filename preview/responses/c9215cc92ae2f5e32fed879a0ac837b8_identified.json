Reagan spoke about United States arms shipments to Iran. Respondents were asked to evaluate Reagan's job performance and his handling of world affairs, relations with Iran, and dealings with terrorists. They were also asked whether they believe Reagan was telling the truth about arms shipments and whether Schultz and/or other advisors should resign. Respondents were asked if they watched the press conference and if so, their opinion of what the president said was recorded.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1986-11-19\" cycle=\"P1\">1986-11-19</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1986-11-19\" cycle=\"P1\">1986-11-19</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>The adult population of the United States aged 18 and over.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Households were selected by random digit dialing.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          telephone interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 The data contain blanks.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR08644.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
