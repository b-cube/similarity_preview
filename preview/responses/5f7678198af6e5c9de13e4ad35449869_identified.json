Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain VBW088&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; was clustered with three type strains of Vitellibacter species and exhibited sequence similarity of 97.3 % with Vitellibacter soesokkakensis RSSK-12&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. However, strain VBW088&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and V. soesokkakensis RSSK-12&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; showed a low DNA-DNA relatedness (12.7\\ufffd\\ufffd3.5 %). Strain VBW088T was positive for catalase and oxidase. Growth occurred at 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd37 \\ufffd\\ufffdC with optimum at 30 \\ufffd\\ufffdC, at pH 6.0\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd8.0 (optimum 6.0) and with up to 5 % of NaCl concentration (w/v) with optimum at 1\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2 % NaCl. The major fatty acids (&gt;10 %) were iso-C15:0 (33.5 %) and iso-C17:0 3-OH (32.0 %). The polar lipids detected in strain VBW088T consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), one unidentified aminolipid and three unidentified phospholipids. The DNA G+C content of strain VBW088T was 36.7 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic inference, DNA-DNA relatedness, chemotaxonomic analysis and physiological data, the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Vitellibacter, for which the name Vitellibacter nionensis sp. nov., is proposed, with type strain VBW088T (=KCTC 32420T = MCC 2354T)</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4713\">     <title>Diurnal variability of Synechococcus abundance in Sagami Bay, Japan</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4713</link>     <description>Title: Diurnal variability of Synechococcus abundance in Sagami Bay, Japan &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Mitbavkar, S.; Saino, T. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Synechococcus, the most dominant picophytoplankton in coastal regions, exhibits diurnal variations in the open ocean. The aim of this study was to assess its short-term population dynamics and cell cycle phases through DNA analysis in a coastal region (Sagami Bay, Japan) by sampling at fixed intervals vertically across the euphotic zone. Day-to-day variations in physical processes such as mixing, induced by wind, and advective events played an important role in structuring Synechococcus population. Compared to sub-surface population, surface cells entered S phase earlier in the day and were arrested and accumulated in the S phase for a longer time suggesting an inhibitory effect by higher irradiance. Increase of G2-phase cells during the dark suggests progression of cells through S phase in absence of light. Although the length of G2-phase was not known, subsequent increase in G1-phase cells in the early morning and late evening suggests occurrence of two cohorts of cells which divided in the dark phase or late evening of the cycle. This study showed that the population responds differently across the euphotic zone depending on the physical structure of the water column and its cell cycle phases are controlled by the vertical irradiance availability</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4708\">     <title>Distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests of South Asia..</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4708</link>     <description>Title: Distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests of South Asia.. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Giri, C.; Long, J.; Abbas, S.; ManiMurali, R.; Qamer, F.M.; Pengra, B.; Thau, D. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Mangrove forests in South Asia occur along the tidal sea edge of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. These forests provide important ecosystem goods and services to the region's dense coastal populations and support important functions of the biosphere. Mangroves are under threat from both natural and anthropogenic stressors; however the current status and dynamics of the region's mangroves are poorly understood. We mapped the current extent of mangrove forests in South Asia and identified mangrove forest cover change (gain and loss) from 2000 to 2012 using Landsat satellite data. We also conducted three case studies in Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India), and Sundarbans (Bangladesh and India) to identify rates, patterns, and causes of change in greater spatial and thematic details compared to regional assessment of mangrove forests. Our findings revealed that the areal extent of mangrove forests in South Asia is approximately 1,187,476 ha representing \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd7% of the global total. Our results showed that from 2000 to 2012, 92,135 ha of mangroves were deforested and 80,461 ha were reforested with a net loss of 11,673 ha. In all three case studies, mangrove areas have remained the same or increased slightly, however, the turnover was greater than the net change. Both, natural and anthropogenic factors are responsible for the change and turnover. The major causes of forest cover change are similar throughout the region; however, specific factors may be dominant in specific areas. Major causes of deforestation in South Asia include (i) conversion to other land use (e.g. conversion to agriculture, shrimp farms, development, and human settlement), (ii) over-harvesting (e.g. grazing, browsing and lopping, and fishing), (iii) pollution, (iv) decline in freshwater availability, (v) floodings, (vi) reduction of silt deposition, (vii) coastal erosion, and (viii) disturbances from tropical cyclones and tsunamis. Our analysis in the region's diverse socio-economic and environmental conditions highlights complex patterns of mangrove distribution and change. Results from this study provide important insight to the conservation and management of the important and threatened South Asian mangrove ecosystem</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4703\">     <title>The distribution of the chaetognath population and its interaction with environmental characteristics in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4703</link>     <description>Title: The distribution of the chaetognath population and its interaction with environmental characteristics in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Nair, V.R.; Kusum, K.K.; Gireesh, R.; Nair, M. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The Bay of Bengal (BoB) and the Arabian Sea (AS), the two major ocean basins in the north Indian Ocean, share similarities in geographical and meteorological characteristics but differ in hydrographic characteristics and biological production. The BoB is traditionally considered a less productive region than the AS. Chaetognatha, a major taxon of carnivorous mesozooplankton, often rank second in abundance to copepods and thus play a pivotal role in the pelagic food web of this region. We studied the influence of environmental variables on the distribution and the diversity of chaetognaths in these two ocean basins. Of the 21 species observed during the study, Flaccisagitta enflata dominated in the mixed layer to the thermocline, Decipisagitta decipiens from the bottom of the thermocline to 500 m and Eukrohnia fowleri below 500 m. Mesoscale and basin-scale processes such as eddies, gyres and upwelling had a profound influence on the abundance in the upper layer, while the presence of an oxygen minimum zone in the mid-depth layers had a crucial effect on the vertical distribution of the chaetognath population. Despite the variation in the controlling factors on chaetognath populations in the BoB and AS, the patterns of depth-specific abundance were similar</description>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
