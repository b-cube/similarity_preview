Sixteen other Japanese Universities from all over the country participated in the meeting and the opportunity was used to provide those present with a clear account of the development of Future Earth in Asia and identify potential opportunities for collaboration in the development of capacity for research, education and training in sustainability studies throughout the region. All participating universities have a graduate level Environmental Leadership Programme (ELP) that has been strongly supported and funded by the Government of Japan. Fumiko Kasuga the Vice President of the Science Council of Japan also participated in the discourse. The Director of ROAP provided a historical account of the development of Future Earth, its scope, progress and roles played by various institutions and organizations in Asia and elsewhere in the development of awareness and understanding about Future Earth. He provided insights considered valuable by the participants on the necessary next steps and the vital building blocks for the successful establishment of multidisciplinary integrated research in Asia that are solutions oriented for the benefit of society. Fumiko Kasuga presented a detailed update on the state of affairs in the development of the distributed secretariat to manage Future Earth at the global, regional and local contexts. Michael Norton a professor at the Graduate School presented the concept of a Future Earth Integrated Education and Research Centre that Tohoku University plans to establish. The Centre aims to play a key role in developing capacity for Future Earth in the region, building on its current ELP. Compared to the current ELP the proposed programme at the Centre will have the following additional features:</span></p> <ul> <li>It will engage with multiple stakeholders in mutual learning and co-design with regard to the Centre\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds programmes and activities;</li> <li>It aims to broaden the existing ELP focus to include agenda essential for global sustainability;</li> <li>It will develop\\ufffd\\ufffd and promote educational materials and methodologies to support training programmes for Future Earth in the region;</li> <li>It will provide opportunities for strengthening the collaborative links for research and education for global sustainability with institutions in Asia and elsewhere; and</li> <li>It will strengthen networking among institutions providing education for sustainable development within the context of Future Earth in Asia and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </li> </ul> <p>The establishment of such a centre at Tohoku University can provide an initial test-bed for ideas on how to organise the infrastructure to develop the intellectual capacity of nations in the region to meet the needs of Future Earth for co-designed, co-produced and co-disseminated scientific knowledge vital for achieving global sustainability.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Capacity building</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable development</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global sustainability research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Earth system science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Strategic planning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global environmental change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Education</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Regional Offices</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-01-28T15:20:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/icsu-asia/news-centre/news/icsu-roap-establishes-collaborative-link-with-unu-iigh\">     <title>ICSU ROAP establishes collaborative link with UNU IIGH</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/icsu-asia/news-centre/news/icsu-roap-establishes-collaborative-link-with-unu-iigh</link>     <description>ICSU ROAP and United Nations University International Institute for Global Health discusses collaboration</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p style=\"color: rgb(102, 102, 102); \">Nordin Hasan, Director of ICSU ROAP met with the Director of the United Nations University, International Institute for Global Health (UNU IIGH) on 23 August 2013\\ufffd\\ufffd<span>to discuss matters of common interest in the Asia-Pacific region.

The overall scope is to address the regional research priorities in the framework of a newly established international research initiative Future Earth.   </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><strong>CONDITIONS</strong></p> <p>Swedish Scientists in collaboration with the developing country partner can apply for networking support of SEK 90 000, for a period of one year. The networking grant is expected to result in draft project proposals within the regional priorities. The draft proposals can subsequently be developed to project proposals endorsed by the Future Earth scientific committee and the Regional Offices of ICSU and can target funding from the research and development funding agencies.</p> <p><strong>APPLICANT</strong></p> <p>Applicants for the SSEESS-Research Links Programme are individual researchers affiliated with Swedish research institutions, who collaborate with regional scientists on regional priorities ( at least one scientist from Sweden and a partner from the region in question).

Since the first colloquium in 1965, this Colloquium has been hosted by several European and African countries. The African countries that had a chance to organize this event were Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Morocco, Mozambique, Tunisia and South Africa. Based on the decision of the Geological Society of Africa (GSAf) General Assembly held on 14 January 2011 at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa (during the 23rd Colloquium), the organization of the next Colloquium of African Geology (CAG24) as well as the 14th Conference of the Geological Society of Africa and the 40th Anniversary of the Geological Society of Africa (1973\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2013) was assigned to Ethiopia. This will be conducted at the United Nations Economic Commission Conference Center (UNECA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from 8 to 14 January 2013. The CAG24 will be organized by the Ethiopian Geosciences and Mineral Engineering Association (EGMEA) in cooperation with governmental and non\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgovernmental organizations under the auspices of the Geological Society of Africa (GSAf). The Theme of the Conference is: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd40 Years of GSAf (1973\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2013): Earth Sciences Solutions to African Development Challenges\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p align=\"left\">The Second Circular presents details of the sessions, workshops, short courses, roundtables and field excursions to be held during the conference.
