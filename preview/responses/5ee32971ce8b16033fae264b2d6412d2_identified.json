But by contrast with his ideas about method, induction, or experiment, the significance of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinterpretation of nature\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd has received very little scholarly attention. This paper tests the originality of Bacon\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds idea by means of a focused survey of existing forms of renaissance natural knowledge\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAristotelian and anti-Aristotelian natural philosophy, Galenic and Paracelsian medicine, natural magic, physiognomy, natural history\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbefore turning to consider the much more prominent place of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinterpretation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the fields of renaissance logic, revealed and natural theology, and law. It finds that Bacon\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds application of the idea of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinterpretation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to nature was highly original, but also that certain important aspects of his conception have analogies in renaissance civil law. The article concludes by exploring the implications of these findings for a recent body of scholarship in the history of the sciences that invokes the notion of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinterpretation of nature\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to characterize pre-Baconian natural philosophy more generally. </summary> <dc:date>2014-10-27T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Consciousness and the Physical World</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245189\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Josephson, Brian D</name> </author> <author> <name>Ramachandran, Vilayanur S</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245189</id> <updated>2015-01-28T12:03:26Z</updated> <published>1978-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Consciousness and the Physical World Josephson, Brian D; Ramachandran, Vilayanur S Edited proceedings of an interdisciplinary symposium on consciousness held at the University of Cambridge in January 1978, including a foreword by Freeman J.
