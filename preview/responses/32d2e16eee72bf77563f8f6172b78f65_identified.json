and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) are the most important oxides of nitrogen in urban atmospheres and it is NO<sub>2</sub> which has the more significant health and ecosystem effects.\\ufffd\\ufffd Major sources of NO<sub>2</sub> in urban areas result from fuel combustion in motor vehicles, power generation, heating plants and industrial processes, mostly by oxidation of NO emissions from these sources.\\ufffd\\ufffd NO<sub>2</sub> is a respiratory tract irritant, is toxic at high concentrations and is involved in the formation of photochemical smog and acid rain.\\ufffd\\ufffd It can also cause direct damage to crops and other vegetation, together with SO<sub>2</sub> and ozone (UNEP/WHO 1994).\\ufffd\\ufffd High concentrations of NO<sub>2</sub> can have an indirect effect on ecosystems

the breeding season, frogs live in shallow ponds and ditches, but spend much time on land during the rest of the year.\\ufffd\\ufffd The frog population is therefore affected by conditions on land as well as in the shallow water bodies in which they breed, including agricultural drainage, modification of breeding sites, acidification of fresh waters and pollution by fertilizers and from other sources.\\ufffd\\ufffd It is difficult to monitor populations of adult frogs, but a rough approximation of frog colony size in a pond can be obtained by monitoring spawn masses.\\ufffd\\ufffd Since
