Despite a growing body of LiDAR literature, gaps in information on issues related to acquisition and processing of LiDAR data still exist (Gatziolis and Andersen, 2008, Evans et al. 2009). In recent years, various efforts have been made, at state level and beyond, for web-based distribution of raw LiDAR data (e.g. OpenTopography, CLICK) as well as LiDAR-derived products (e.g. INSIDE Idaho). However, proper processing of raw data, and documenting the processing steps in a standard-compliant metadata are essential before LiDAR data and value-added products can be made available to the public domain through data portals. This data provides a demonstration of a LiDAR workflow for NSF Idaho EPSCoR project Water Resources in a Changing Climate. This is collection level metadata for LAS files collected by USDA - Forest Service as a part of a larger project to use LiDAR for forestry application. The lidar survey was conducted by vendor Earth Eye LLC, 3680 Avalon Park Blvd. East Suite 200, Orlando Fl. 3282. Lidar instrument Leica ALS60 was flown in a Turbo Prop Cessna 207 aircraft over the period of October 14-25, 2009. The data were delivered in LAS 1.1 format with information on return number, easting, northing, elevation, scan angle, and intensity for each return. This project is the data acquisition phase of a administrative study being done in collaboration with the Nez Perce National Forest, Grangeville, ID; Forest Service Region 1 Regional Office, Missoula, MT (Forest Inventory and Analysis and Remote Sensing/ Geospatial Team); and Rocky Mountain Research Station - Forest Sciences Lab, Moscow, ID. The primary goal of the study is to provide operational implementation of LiDAR technology in support of project level planning. The proposed applications of LiDAR in support of planning are: vegetation structural modeling, erosion modeling, fuels, transportation planning, timber system planning, wildlife habitat modeling, and stream quality. The Rocky Mountain Research Station will provide the development of peer-reviewed forest structural metrics and technical support in implementation of LiDAR technology. The technical specifications have been defined to specifically support vegetation modeling using LiDAR data. The project area consists of one contiguous blocks totaling 17325 hectares in north central Idaho. The project area consists of moderately variable topographic configurations with diverse vegetation components. Clear Creek is a tributary of the Middle Fork Clearwater River located east of Kooskia, Idaho. Vegetation is variable, transitioning from low elevation shrubland and mixed conifers to upper elevation spruce-fir. Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are the predominant species at lower to mid elevations occupying a fairly xeric setting transitioning to grand fir (Abies grandis) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) at mid elevations and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) at the higher elevations.</abstract><purpose>To use LiDAR in support of natural resource research and management applications.</purpose><langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>2009-10-14</begdate><enddate>2009-10-30</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>ground condition</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>20091030</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-115.854896</westbc><eastbc>-115.636115</eastbc><northbc>46.112332</northbc><southbc>45.928033</southbc></bounding><lboundng><leftbc Sync=\"TRUE\">589323.318684</leftbc><rightbc Sync=\"TRUE\">604874.796654</rightbc><bottombc Sync=\"TRUE\">5087476.075013</bottombc><topbc Sync=\"TRUE\">5106894.093798</topbc></lboundng></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>Elevation</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>LiDAR</themekey><themekey>LAS file</themekey><themekey>lidar boundaries</themekey></theme><place><placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt><placekey>Nez Perce National Forest</placekey><placekey>Grangeville</placekey><placekey>Clear Creek</placekey></place><place><placekey>Idaho</placekey></place></keywords><useconst>Proper credit to Idaho LiDAR Consortium</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>USDA Forest Service - RMRS - Moscow Forestry Sciences Laboratory</cntorg><cntper>Rob Liebermann</cntper></cntorgp><cntaddr><address>1221 South Main Street</address><city>Moscow</city><state>ID</state><postal>83843</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr></cntinfo></ptcontac><datacred>Nez Perce National Forest, U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, University of Idaho</datacred><secinfo><secclass>Public</secclass></secinfo><native>Microsoft Windows 7; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000</native><natvform Sync=\"TRUE\">Shapefile</natvform></idinfo><dataqual><posacc><vertacc><qvertpa /></vertacc></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Earth Eye</origin><pubdate>20091014</pubdate></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>none</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20091014</begdate><enddate>20091030</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><srccurr>ground condition</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>None</srccitea><srccontr>None</srccontr></srcinfo><procstep><procdesc>Airborne Differential GPS Base Station Support:   A Trimble R7 and Zephyr geodetic model 2 antenna was set up on a tripod at the Grangeville, ID airport for the purpose of 0.5 second epoch differential GPS corrections in support of the aerial LiDAR missions or flights.

The points were collected at positions that did not have ground obstructions, were on constant slopes, and had enough sky visibility to yield a PDOP (position dilution of precision) of 2.0 or better. Each point was occupied for a minimum of 20 minutes, producing an accuracy equal to or better than third order control. Every effort was made to ensure that the control points were distributed well throughout the project and that the requirement of three control points collected at low, medium and high terrain positions was met. In total, 26 control points were collected with accompanying images of the point's surrounding environment and notes recording average PDOP level and number of satellites in view. Trimble Business Center was then used to post process the control points, utilizing the CORS station IDNP for the differential corrections.  </procdesc><procdate>20091014</procdate></procstep><procstep><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Earth Eye LLC</cntorg></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physicial address</addrtype><address>3680 Avalon Park Blvd. East, Suite 200</address><city>Orlando</city><state>Florida</state><postal>32828</postal><country>United States</country></cntaddr></cntinfo></proccont><procdesc>Flight Operations Sensor Parameters:   LiDAR and imagery collection SORTIES we executed from the Pulman/Moscow airport in Washington due to the need for oxygen support, or from the Grangeville airport when the onboard oxygen was sufficient for the anticipated duration of the mission.

Point number 1 had an unacceptable PDOP level and had to be excluded.  10/15/2009: Collection of GPS control points 8 through 16, which were primarily on the northern and eastern boundaries of the project, some points being in the highest areas of the project area.  10/16/2009: LiDAR and imagery collection of 17 flight lines. For the purposes of imagery collection, we flew lines 1, 5, 10, 15, etc. to line 55. Since the imagery foot print covered a large area as compared to the LiDAR, every fifth line sufficed to cover the required side lap between images. It was also important to fly these in the same mission so the imagery would be as radiometrically consistent as possible. We then collected lines 51 - 54. The results of the GPS post processing showed a combined separation value less than 0.1m (forward processing in time as compared to backwards) and a maximum PDOP level of 2.3, both of which are considered excellent.  10/17/2009: Two missions flown for the collection of 17 LiDAR lines. Lines collected were 29 through 49, excluding previously collected lines 30, 35, 40, and 45. For the first mission, the combined separation value was below 0.1m and the maximum PDOP was below 2.3. For the second, the combined separation value was below 0.1m and the maximum PDOP was below 2.9. During the flight, control points 17 through 23 were collected, but point 21 had to be deleted due to battery failure. The area collected was primarily along the closed section of road 286, south of the split from 9730.   10/20/2009: Collection of GPS control points 25 through 29, which were primarily in the lowest areas of the project that could be accessed. These included a clearing to the north of road 650 at the project boundary, and two positions east of Crane Hill, south of Big Cedar.   10/25/2009: Two missions flown for the collection of 29 LiDAR flight lines. The lines collected were 2 through 28, excluding previously collected lines 5, 10, 15, etc. Also, some of these lines were flown twice due to clouds being in the first version (22, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 28). For the first mission, the combined separation value was below 0.05m and the average PDOP was around 2.0, with one spike at 3.0. For the second, the combined separation value was below 0.08m and the maximum PDOP was below 1.6.  </procdesc></procstep><procstep><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Earth Eye LLC</cntorg></cntorgp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physicial address</addrtype><address>3680 Avalon Park Blvd. East, Suite 200</address><city>Orlando</city><state>Florida</state><postal>32828</postal><country>United States</country></cntaddr></cntinfo></proccont><procdesc>LiDAR Point Cloud Classification:   Once the LiDAR data was calibrated and adjusted vertically to the control network, classification was conducted to establish the ground model.

The calibration techniques utilized during this process ensured systematic biases were minimized to the maximum extent possible from offset errors in the IMU (roll, pitch, and heading) or from the sensor (swath width, edge curl, intensity differences, ranging biases). These techniques were accomplished manually utilizing Earth Eye Earth View\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd software, ensuring the highest accuracy possible for the relative surface adjustment process.
