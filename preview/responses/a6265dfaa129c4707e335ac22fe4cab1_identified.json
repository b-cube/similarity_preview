Up to and including 2012-13 this information was collected by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA).&#xD; &#xD; The information in this release is derived from the local precepting authorities section (lines 23, 24 and 25) submitted by all 326 billing authorities in England; and the individual local data section (lines 23x, 24x and 25x) of the Council Tax Requirement (CTR1) forms submit-ted by 241 parished billing authorities. The data are as reported by local authorities, and have been subjected to rigorous validation processes.&#xD; &#xD; The release has been compiled by the Local Government Finance - Data Collection, Analy-sis and Accountancy division of the Department for Communities and Local Government.&#xD; Parishes and other local precepting authorities in England, 2013-14&#xD; &#xD; There are more than 10,000 parishes in England. A parish may be represented by a parish council, a town council or community council. In the case of small parishes, the parish meet-ing (an annual meeting of all electors in a parish) can take on the role of parish council. Par-ishes represent the most local level of Government in England - the third tier of local gov-ernment.&#xD; &#xD; In a small number of the un-parished areas bodies called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcharter trustees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd exist. These bodies exist to administer ceremonial functions, such as the appointment of a mayor, where there is no parish to administer them. There are currently 16 such bodies in England one less than in 2012-13 due to Crewe in Cheshire becoming a parish council on 4 April 2013.&#xD; &#xD; There are two further local precepting authorities: the Inner and Middle Temples of London (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe Temples\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) situated within the Temple area of the City of London. The Temples are dif-ferent from parishes and charter trustees in that they perform the functions within their area that are performed by the City of London authority (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe City\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). In exchange for performing these functions the City pays the Temples an annual precept apportioned from the council tax raised by the City.&#xD; &#xD; Parish or village councils need funds to support their activities. These funds are raised by adding an extra cost known as a \"precept\" to each householder's Council Tax bill. Parishes (together with charter trustees and the two Temples of London as described above) are col-lectively known as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlocal precepting authorities\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. This means they have the power to raise a precept on properties in their area in order to finance the functions that they perform. Parish precepts are included separately on council tax bills and are collected by the billing authority on behalf of the parish.&#xD; &#xD; Some smaller parishes may group together for precepting purposes and will perform this function as one local precepting authority and for the purposes of this release are counted as 1 parish.&#xD; &#xD; Further information is provided in the Definitions section of this release.&#xD; (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/260449/Parishes_and_other_precepting_authorities_2013-14_England__revised_.pdf)&#xD; &#xD; Special factors affecting comparability to previous years&#xD; &#xD; This is the first time DCLG has collected local parish council tax data. Changes to the council tax system and the method for collecting individual parish data mean these figures are not directly comparable to earlier years and caution must be taken when interpreting time trends. Significant factors which have affected comparability include:&#xD; &#xD; Localisation of council tax support; a change in the way council tax benefit is paid. Council tax support is now paid in the form of a grant passed down to parishes from their billing authori-ties and is not included in the local precept. Previously individual council taxpayers might re-ceive support to pay their council tax bill from DWP. The value of this support would have been included in the local precept. However, taxpayers now have their bills covered by coun-cil tax support and therefore are removed from the tax base, whereas under the old system they would previously have been included. The localisation of council tax support has reduced the local precept and the tax bases significantly compared to earlier years (see Definitions for further details).&#xD; &#xD; Parish groupings; in some cases parishes have been grouped together for precepting pur-poses. This makes the number of parishes setting a precept in 2013-14 look smaller than in previous collections - for example data collected by CIPFA split all groupings and listed all parishes individually.&#xD; &#xD; Data previously published on local precepting authorities can be accessed here:&#xD; https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/parishes-and-charter-trustees-in-england-2012-to-2013.&#xD; &#xD; Revisions&#xD; &#xD; This is a revised version of the original statistical release on Parishes and other local precepting authorities: 2013-14 England. The revisions are minor and do not change the headline figures.&#xD; &#xD; These adjustments correct for an error in the way the data were originally uploaded.</j.3:description>     <j.1:theme rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/themes/lg-finance-local-taxation\"/>     <j.4:dataDump rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data/council-tax/collected/category/dump\"/>     <j.3:license rdf:resource=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\"/>     <j.4:triples rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer\"     >467334</j.4:triples>     <rdfs:comment>This dataset provides information on local precepting authorities (parishes, charter trustees and Temples) and the amount of council tax collected on their behalf by their billing authorities in England, known as a precept, for the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15.

All data are submitted through the on-line Continuous Recording system (CORE). &#xD; &#xD; The rents reported to CORE are for properties let within the financial year and therefore will differ to figures on the rents for all social stock.&#xD; &#xD; Private registered providers (PRPs)&#xD; &#xD; PRPs refer in this document to Private Registered Providers of social housing in England that are registered with the social housing regulator (from 1st April 2012 this is the Homes and Communities Agency\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Regulation Committee).  These were previously term Registered Social Landlords or housing associations.  This term excludes local authority registered providers.  &#xD; &#xD; General needs housing&#xD; &#xD; General needs housing covers the bulk of housing stock for rent and includes both self-contained and shared housing. It is stock that is not designated for specific client groups requiring support, or stock that does not have the special design features that are specific to housing for older people or supported housing. Where additional support is offered to all residents as a matter of course, this stock is not general needs (see definition of supported housing).&#xD; &#xD; For further information  please see the 'Social Housing Lettings: April 2012 to March 2013, England' statistical release available in  [PDF format](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/252344/REVISED_20131023_CORE_statistical_release_2012-13.pdf).&#xD; &#xD; </j.3:description>     <j.4:sparqlEndpoint rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/sparql\"/>   </j.0:Dataset>   <j.4:Dataset rdf:about=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data/duty-owed-no-accommodation-secured\">     <j.5:inFolder rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/folders/themes/homelessness\"/>     <j.4:sparqlEndpoint rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/sparql\"/>     <rdfs:comment>This dataset contains numbers of households accepted by the authority as homeless and in priority need, but for which no accommodation has yet been secured.</rdfs:comment>     <j.0:graph rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/graph/duty-owed-no-accommodation-secured\"/>     <j.3:description>The term \"Homelessness\" is often considered to apply only to people \"sleeping rough\". However, most of our statistics on homelessness relate to the statutorily homeless i.e. those households which meet specific criteria of priority need set out in legislation, and to whom a homelessness duty has been accepted by a local authority.&#xD; &#xD; Such households are rarely homeless in the literal sense of being without a roof over their heads, but are more likely to be threatened with the loss of, or are unable to continue with, their current accommodation.&#xD; &#xD; A detailed explanation of the responsibilities of local authorities in this area is available from the DCLG website, [here](http://www.communities.gov.uk/housing/housingresearch/housingstatistics/housingstatisticsby/homelessnessstatistics/notesdefinitions/).&#xD; &#xD; A \"main homelessness duty\" is owed where the authority is satisfied that the applicant is eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and falls within a specified priority need group. Such statutorily homeless households are referred to as \"acceptances\".&#xD; &#xD; This dataset provides statistics on the numbers of cases where it has been decided that the applicant is eligible for assistance, but no accommodation had yet been provided.&#xD; &#xD; The numbers are presented in terms of households, not individuals. A household is defined as: one person living alone, or a group of people living at the same address who share common housekeeping or a living room.&#xD; &#xD; This data was derived from Table 784a, available for download as an [Excel spreadsheet](http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/xls/2102108.xls).</j.3:description>     <rdfs:label>Duty owed, but no accommodation secured</rdfs:label>     <j.1:theme rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/themes/homelessness\"/>     <j.0:contactEmail rdf:resource=\"mailto:ODC@communities.gsi.gov.uk\"/>     <j.3:modified rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\"     >2012-03-21T11:38:12Z</j.3:modified>     <j.3:publisher rdf:resource=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/department/dclg\"/>     <j.4:dataDump rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data/duty-owed-no-accommodation-secured/dump\"/>     <rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset\"/>     <rdf:type rdf:resource=\"http://publishmydata.com/def/dataset#Dataset\"/>     <j.3:references rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/docs\"/>     <j.3:issued rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\"     >2012-03-21T10:54:12Z</j.3:issued>     <j.3:license rdf:resource=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/\"/>     <j.3:subject rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/themes/homelessness\"/>     <j.3:title>Duty owed, but no accommodation secured</j.3:title>   </j.4:Dataset>   <j.0:Dataset rdf:about=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data/council-tax/collection-rate/ratio\">     <j.4:dataDump rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data/council-tax/collection-rate/ratio/dump\"/>     <j.4:triples rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer\"     >11979</j.4:triples>     <j.3:description>The estimated collection rate is taken into account when an authority determines the amount of Band D council tax to be charged.

Note that over that period, there have been numerous changes to the structure of local government, therefore some districts do not have values for the full series of years, only for those years when the corresponding local authority was in operation. &#xD; &#xD; Affordable housing is the sum of affordable rent, social rent, intermediate rent and affordable home ownership. Affordable homes are defined in line with the National Planning Policy Framework, published 27 March 2012, as housing units (or traveller pitches and bed spaces when describing a shared dwelling such as a hostel) provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market. Eligibility may be determined with regard to local authority allocations policies, local incomes and local house prices depending on the type of affordable housing. Affordable housing should include provisions to remain at an affordable price for future eligible households or for the subsidy to be recycled for alternative affordable housing provision.&#xD; &#xD; Affordable rented housing is a new form of social housing, introduced in 2011 as the main type of affordable housing supply. It may only be delivered with grant through the Affordable Homes Programme 2011-15 and other associated and subsequent programmes or without grant by local authority and other providers, where a contract or confirmation of the ability to charge an affordable rent is in place. Affordable rented homes are let by local authorities or private registered providers of social housing to households who are eligible for social rented housing. Affordable rent is subject to rent controls that require a rent of up to 80 per cent of the local market rent (including service charges, where applicable).&#xD; &#xD; Social rented housing is rented housing owned and managed by local authorities and private registered providers, for which target rents are determined through the national rent regime. It may also include rented housing managed by other persons and provided under equivalent rental arrangements to the above.&#xD; &#xD; Intermediate affordable housing is housing at prices and rents above those of social rent but below market price or rents, and which meet the criteria as set out in the definition for affordable housing. These can include equity loan products, shared ownership and intermediate rent.&#xD; &#xD; The data in this dataset were derived from Tables 1006, 1006a, 1007 and 1008 of the DCLG 'Live statistical tables', available in the form of Excel spreadsheets [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-affordable-housing-supply).&#xD; &#xD; For further guidance see the [Affordable Housing Supply:&#xD; April 2013 to March 2014 England Statistical Release](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/363989/Affordable_Housing_Supply_2013-14.pdf).</j.3:description>     <j.3:subject rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/themes/housing-market\"/>     <j.4:triples rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer\"     >222720</j.4:triples>     <j.3:publisher rdf:resource=\"http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/department/dclg\"/>     <j.3:title>Additional Affordable Dwellings</j.3:title>     <j.3:references rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/docs\"/>     <j.3:modified rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\"     >2014-10-24T13:09:26+01:00</j.3:modified>   </j.0:Dataset>   <j.0:Dataset rdf:about=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/data/geography/enterprise-zones\">     <j.5:inFolder rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/folders/themes/geography\"/>     <rdfs:label>Enterprise Zones</rdfs:label>     <j.0:contactEmail rdf:resource=\"http://data.gov.uk/dataset/english-enterprise-zone-sites\"/>     <j.3:license rdf:resource=\"http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/public-sector/mapping-agreements/inspire-licence.html\"/>     <j.3:modified rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\"     >2014-10-09T09:31:34+01:00</j.3:modified>     <j.1:keyword>enterprise zone</j.1:keyword>     <j.4:triples rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer\"     >4110</j.4:triples>     <rdfs:comment>Enterprise Zone site boundaries with associated information</rdfs:comment>     <j.1:theme rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/def/concept/themes/geography\"/>     <j.2:zippedShapefile rdf:resource=\"https://opendatacommunities-geo.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/d8ded7a2-4357-4b3f-9273-0d95f2d840fb.zip\"/>     <j.4:sparqlEndpoint rdf:resource=\"http://opendatacommunities.org/sparql\"/>     <j.3:issued rdf:datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#dateTime\"     >2014-10-09T09:31:34+01:00</j.3:issued>     <j.3:description>Data has been supplied and collated from each seperate EZ in varying formats and brought togther to form a national dataset.
