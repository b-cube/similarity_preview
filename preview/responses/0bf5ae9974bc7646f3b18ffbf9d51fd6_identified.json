A.; Foster, G. L.; Chalk, T. B.; Rohling, E. J.; Sexton, P. F.; Lunt, D. J.; Pancost, R. D.; Badger, M. P. S.; Schmidt, D. N. Description: Theory and climate modelling suggest that the sensitivity of Earth's climate to changes in radiative forcing could depend on the background climate. However, palaeoclimate data have thus far been insufficient to provide a conclusive test of this prediction. Here we present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) reconstructions based on multi-site boron-isotope records from the late Pliocene epoch (3.3 to 2.3 million years ago). We find that Earth's climate sensitivity to CO2-based radiative forcing (Earth system sensitivity) was half as strong during the warm Pliocene as during the cold late Pleistocene epoch (0.8 to 0.01\\ufffd\\ufffdmillion years ago). We attribute this difference to the radiative impacts of continental ice-volume changes (the ice-albedo feedback) during the late Pleistocene, because equilibrium climate sensitivity is identical for the two intervals when we account for such impacts using sea-level reconstructions. We conclude that, on a global scale, no unexpected climate feedbacks operated during the warm Pliocene, and that predictions of equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding long-term ice-albedo feedbacks) for our Pliocene-like future (with CO2 levels up to maximum Pliocene levels of 450\\ufffd\\ufffdparts per million) are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5\\ufffd\\ufffdK to 4.5\\ufffd\\ufffdK per doubling of CO2.</summary>     <dc:date>2015-02-05T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Strategic placement of Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus mutanests adjacent to boulders</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1885/12996\" />     <author>       <name>Rae, Stuart</name>     </author>     <id>http://hdl.handle.net/1885/12996</id>     <updated>2015-03-19T23:17:44Z</updated>     <published>2015-02-09T00:00:00Z</published>     <summary type=\"text\">Title: Strategic placement of Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus mutanests adjacent to boulders Author(s): Rae, Stuart Description: CAPSULE: Rock Ptarmigan place their nests adjacent to boulders, in their lee and on their sunnier aspects.&#xD; AIMS: To investigate the proximity and orientation of Rock Ptarmigan nests in relation to boulders and&#xD; vegetation height. METHODS: The distances from boulders of 61 Rock Ptarmigan nests and 60 random points were compared. Orientation variables of nests from boulders were analysed with circular statistical formulae.&#xD; RESULTS: Rock Ptarmigan nests were closer to boulders than random points. The mean orientation of nests&#xD; relative to adjacent boulders was south-east and the prevailing wind was westerly. Vegetation height at nest&#xD; sites was taller than at randomly selected sites.&#xD; CONCLUSION: Rock Ptarmigan which nest next to, in the lee of, and on the south-eastern aspects of boulders,&#xD; probably gain advantages of protection from the prevailing wind and passive thermoregulation from solar&#xD; heat.</summary>     <dc:date>2015-02-09T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Emergence and diversification of the neolithic in Southern Vietnam: insights from coastal Rach Nui</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1885/12995\" />     <author>       <name>Oxenham, Marc F.</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Piper, Philip J.</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Bellwood, Peter</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Bui, Chi Hoang</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Nguyen, Khanh Trung Kien</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Nguyen, Quoc Manh</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Campos, Fredeliza</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Castillo, Cristina</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Wood, Rachel</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Sarjeant, Carmen</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Amano, Noel</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Willis, Anna</name>     </author>     <author>       <name>Ceron, Jasminda</name>     </author>     <id>http://hdl.handle.net/1885/12995</id>     <updated>2015-03-19T23:15:15Z</updated>     <published>2015-02-13T00:00:00Z</published>     <summary type=\"text\">Title: Emergence and diversification of the neolithic in Southern Vietnam: insights from coastal Rach Nui Author(s): Oxenham, Marc F.; Piper, Philip J.; Bellwood, Peter; Bui, Chi Hoang; Nguyen, Khanh Trung Kien; Nguyen, Quoc Manh; Campos, Fredeliza; Castillo, Cristina; Wood, Rachel; Sarjeant, Carmen; Amano, Noel; Willis, Anna; Ceron, Jasminda Description: We examine the southern Vietnamese site of Rach Nui, dated to between 3390 and 3850 cal BP, in the context of three major aspects of the Neolithic in Mainland Southeast Asia: mound formation and chronology, construction techniques, and subsistence economy. Results indicate that this ca. 75 m in diameter, 5 m high mound, comprising over a dozen phases of earthen platforms, upon which were raised sophisticated wooden structures, was built in &lt;200 years. While consuming domesticated millet, rice, and occasionally dogs and pigs, the main subsistence orientation included managed tubers and fruits and a range of mangrove ecosystem taxa: catfishes, turtles, crocodiles, monitor lizards, macaques and langurs, to name a few. This combined vegeculture-foraging lifeway in a mangrove forested environment, likely in the context of a tradable goods extractive industry, adds to a growing picture of significant diversity, and sophisticated construction skills in the Southeast Asian Neolithic.</summary>     <dc:date>2015-02-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Boron isotope evidence for oceanic carbon dioxide leakage during the last deglaciation</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1885/12994\" />     <author>       <name>Mart\\ufffd\\ufffdnez-Bot\\ufffd\\ufffd, M.

A.; Marino, G.; Foster, G. L.; Ziveri, P.; Henehan, M. J.; Rae, J. W. B.; Mortyn, P. G.; Vance, D. Description: Atmospheric CO2 fluctuations over glacial-interglacial cycles remain a major challenge to our understanding of the carbon cycle and the climate system. Leading hypotheses put forward to explain glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations invoke changes in deep-ocean carbon storage, probably modulated by processes in the Southern Ocean, where much of the deep ocean is ventilated. A central aspect of such models is that, during deglaciations, an isolated glacial deep-ocean carbon reservoir is reconnected with the atmosphere, driving the atmospheric CO2 rise observed in ice-core records. However, direct documentation of changes in surface ocean carbon content and the associated transfer of carbon to the atmosphere during deglaciations has been hindered by the lack of proxy reconstructions that unambiguously reflect the oceanic carbonate system. Radiocarbon activity tracks changes in ocean ventilation, but not in ocean carbon content, whereas proxies that record increased deglacial upwelling do not constrain the proportion of upwelled carbon that is degassed relative to that which is taken up by the biological pump. Here we apply the boron isotope pH proxy in planktic foraminifera to two sediment cores from the sub-Antarctic Atlantic and the eastern equatorial Pacific as a more direct tracer of oceanic CO2 outgassing. We show that surface waters at both locations, which partly derive from deep water upwelled in the Southern Ocean, became a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere during the last deglaciation, when the concentration of atmospheric CO2 was increasing. This oceanic CO2 outgassing supports the view that the ventilation of a deep-ocean carbon reservoir in the Southern Ocean had a key role in the deglacial CO2 rise, although our results allow for the possibility that processes operating in other regions may also have been important for the glacial-interglacial ocean-atmosphere exchange of carbon.</summary>     <dc:date>2015-02-12T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry> </feed>  ",
