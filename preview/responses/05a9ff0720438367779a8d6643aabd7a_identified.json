Colony locations were estimated using the foraging locations of workers sampled in summer 2011, genotyped and grouped into full-sib families. The spatial structure of five Bombus species (Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, B. hortorum and B. ruderatus) was determined, with inter-colony distances varying from 7 to 5264 metres. Data were collected as part of a project led by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, funded under the Insect Pollinators Initiative.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Insect Pollinators Initiative</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Buckinghamshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>genetics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bombus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bumble bee</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bombus terrestris</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bombus lapidarius</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bombus pascuorum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bombus hortorum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bombus ruderatus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>relatedness</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-05-29T13:58:24Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/16649ff0-af24-41b0-bcb4-15e610dac170\">     <title>Operational taxonomic units for epilithon bacteria in the rivers  Wolf and Tamar catchments </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/16649ff0-af24-41b0-bcb4-15e610dac170</link>     <description>This dataset contains  operational taxonomic units for epilithon (water samples): Approximate location of sampling sites was determined from maps to provide good spatial coverage of the Wold River through to the Tamar River.

Both green and naturally senesced material was analysed between 1998 and 2010 (although not every year was included within this period). Where green material was analysed, only the current years growth was included in the sample. The dataset also includes analysis of different parts of the plants at the site, for example, Calluna vulgaris stems, Calluna vulgaris leaves. Plant species include Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, Deschampsia flexuosa, Pleurozium schreberi. Determinants include carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose and carbohydrates. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Alwyn Sowerby</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>yearly</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-06T10:01:59Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/eb7599f4-35f8-4365-bd4a-4056ee6c6083\">     <title>Annual vegetative growth and flowering data from Climoor fieldsite in Clocaenog Forest</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/eb7599f4-35f8-4365-bd4a-4056ee6c6083</link>     <description>This dataset includes measurements of annual growth of the higher plant species in the experimental plots at the Climoor field site in the Clocaenog Forest, NE Wales. Years include 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, and in each the measurements were taken in August (at a time of maximum veteative growth at the site). Data include maximum shoot elongation, leading shoot length, and number of flowers, leaves and branches.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Alwyn Sowerby</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annually</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-06T09:59:13Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/143e1a69-d4d7-4ae0-9650-6ffad9fd75b2\">     <title>Vegetation survey data from Climoor fieldsite in Clocaenog Forest</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/143e1a69-d4d7-4ae0-9650-6ffad9fd75b2</link>     <description>This dataset contains vegetation survey data from an upland heath site in the Clocaenog Forest. Vegetation was surveyed in the experimental plots at the Climoor site in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The vegetation at the site is a typical UK upland heathland, dominated by Calluna vulgaris, with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum also being present in the vegetation understory. In each year, measurements were taken at a time period of maximum growth, which was late August/early September. This was done by pin point methodology, and data includes both pin hits as well as measurements converted into plant biomass. Individual species can be examined, as well as the different components of the higher plants (i.e. leaf, stem, flower). </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Alwyn Sowerby</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-06T09:34:45Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/67bbfabb-d981-4ced-b7e7-225205de9c96\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1978 vegetation plot data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/67bbfabb-d981-4ced-b7e7-225205de9c96</link>     <description>This dataset consists of plant species presence and abundance in different sizes and types of plots from 256 1km x 1km square sites surveyed across Great Britain in 1978. Many of the plots were repeated in 1990, 1998 and 2007. General information about the plot was recorded including plot number and type as well as species presence and (usually) cover. Data were collected under the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project managed by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>plants</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-04T14:09:33Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
