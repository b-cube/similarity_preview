Two stations are visited about once a month: Kahe Point (Station 1:  21.34N, 158.27W) and Station ALOHA (Station 2: 22.75N, 158W).  Various other stations are made intermittently in support of similar research objectives or mooring deployments.  HOT thermosalinograph data have been obtained since cruise 63 using a SBE-21 Seacat thermosalinograph system.  Data are recorded every 10 seconds from water collected by a continuous seawater system aboard each vessel from a depth of about 3 meters.       </abstract>       <purpose>         The objective of the physical component of HOT is to describe and understand the ocean climate and variability at a deep-water site in the North Pacific subtropical gyre near Hawaii. This requires a long time series of physical oceanographic variables, including water mass properties and currents, supporting and complementing the objectives of the biogeochemical component of HOT.       </purpose>       <supplinf>         NOAASupplemental: Entry_ID: Unknown Sensor_Name: SBE-21 Seacat thermosalinograph system Source_Name: ship Project_Campaign: Hawaii Ocean Time series (HOT) Originating_Center: University of Hawaii Storage_Medium: ASCII Reference: None Online_size: 60.568 Mbytes;

The field phase of these programs has ended, but support from the Ocean Sciences Division of NSF has enabled continuation of our basic HOT measurement program until mid-2001. The PO component contributes to the objectives of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) Programme by providing information on interannual to decadal variability of the North Pacific Ocean.

During transit from Honolulu to the time-series station ALOHA (A Long-term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment) one weight test is done to between 700 and 1000 m at station 1 off Kahe Point (16 km offshore from the western tip of Oahu, 21 20.6&apos; N, 158 16.4&apos; W, 1500 m water depth). Following the successful winch test, a CTD/rosette cast to 1000 m is conducted. This cast serves as a &quot;shakedown&quot; for the remainder of the cruise, and the functioning of the components of the CTD/rosette system as well as coordination between winch, deck and console operators can be tested. The training of new personnel in activities such as taking meteorological observations, and sampling salinities is also done in this station. The data taken at Kahe Point (station 1) represent an additional time-series of water properties at a near-shore site.  Upon arrival at ALOHA (station 2), operations commence with a deep cast (maximum depth approximately 4750 m), 36-hour burst sampling3 of the upper 1000 m at the same location, plus CTD casts to support ancillary JGOFS work of about an extra 12 hours duration. Time permitting, the last CTD cast of the cruise will be a deep cast. On occasion, one cast will be done at station 3 (40 miles north of ALOHA at 23 25&apos; N, 158 W).  The second and following casts at station ALOHA are sampled to at least 1000 m depth. Cast 2 is called a &quot;density cast&quot; because water samples are taken at a number of specified density values ranging from [sigma-theta]= 27.37 to the surface with the intent to resolve the profiles of salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients in potential density coordinates Depths sampled during the following casts within the 36-hour burst sampling period are chosen both by the JGOFS group and the WOCE team, who have to ensure that at least one water sample each is taken within the mixed layer, the shallow salinity maximum, the intermediate salinity minimum and the deepest position of the rosette for calibration of the CTD conductivity sensor. If oxygen bottles will be taken from the cast, then the sampling should include at least the mixed layer, oxygen maximum, oxygen minimum and the deepest rosette position for calibration of the CTD oxygen sensor. The second deep cast of the cruise (if there is one) should include sampling of oxygen bottles in at least seven levels appropriate for calibration of the CTD oxygen sensor, i.e. in the oxycline and two more levels below the oxygen minimum, in addition to the four levels mentioned before.  The primary objective of the HOT program is to assess variability in the central Pacific Ocean on annual and interannual time scales. One of our most important concerns, therefore, is to ensure that the highest possible precision and accuracy is consistently maintained for all water column chemical measurements. In order to achieve the highest possible data quality, we have instituted a quality-assurance/quality-control program, and have attempted to collect all ancillary information necessary to ensure that our data are not biased by sampling artifacts.  Because sampling is over 36 hours, one can average out the effects short-term changes of the depth of density surfaces and the magnitude of hydrographic and nutrient variables (inertial, tidal, and shorter periods).  Thermosalinograph data are recorded every 10 seconds from water collected by a continuous seawater system aboard each vessel from a depth of about 3 meters.  These data are processed and quality controlled. Details of the thermosalinograph processing are documented (Tupas et. al., 1996).  Navigation data are also included in the thermosalinograph data file. The navigation data are recorded every minute from the Global Positioning System (GPS) aboard R/V Moana Wave and linearly interpolated at the same times of the thermosalinograph record.  These data include latitude and longitude.  Error flags were incorporated in the data.         </procdesc>         <srcused>           1990 Chiswell, S., E. Firing, D. Karl, R.  Lukas and C. Winn.

Filenaming convention:  hotccc.sum      where ccc is cruise number  /ths            thermosalinograph data.  Filenaming convention:  hotcccts.dat    where ccc is cruise number ts  is constant  Data File Format:  Thermosalinograph data are distributed in a format specified here.  The thermosalinograph data for each cruise are stored together with the navigation data in an ASCII file. The file names are determined by cruise name and number. For example, the thermosalinograph data for HOT-63 can be found in hot63ts.dat.  The thermosalinograph data files do not contain any header information. Only the data for each cruise are presented in the files. The order of variables in a thermosalinograph record are as follows: time (year, decimal year day), longitude, latitude, temperature, salinity and quality. Note, negative longitude corresponds to West longitude.  Data Record Format:  Column      Variable -------     ------- 1         Year 2         Decimal Year Day (January 1 = Year Day 0) 3         Longitude (decimal degrees) 4         Latitude (decimal degrees) 5         Temperature (Degrees Celsius, International Temperature Scale of 1990) 6         Salinity (1978 International Practical Salinity Scale) 7         Quality (defined by investigator) **  FORTRAN FORMAT  (i4, f10.5, f12.6, f11.6, f7.3, f7.3, i3)  ** The quality word is the left-to-right concatenation of required quality bytes for temperature and salinity; the first byte represents temperature, the second represents salinity. Quality information is only available for cruises after HOT-71.  The byte values are defined as follows:  byte value      Definition 2           Acceptable measurement. 3           Questionable measurement. 4           Bad measurement.
