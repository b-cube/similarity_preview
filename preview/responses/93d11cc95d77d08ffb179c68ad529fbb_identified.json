The toxicity test procedure followed the OECD guideline 222 (earthworm reproduction test (Eisenia fetida/andrei)). Exposure concentrations for both nano and non-nano Cerium oxide particulate forms and the cerium salt materials were 41, 102, 256, 640, 1600, 4000, 10000 mg Ce per kg (Dry Weight soil). Each replicate container held 500 g soil with ten worms. There were three replicate containers per treatment concentration. All exposures were run concurrently and hence effect could be benchmarked against a universal control treatment for the experiment. This comprised of ten separate replicates of Lufa 2.2 soil without amendment of any form of Cerium. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jonathan Newman</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-04-23T09:18:17Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d8ef71eb-3d22-4f98-af15-9d8e046ccb63\">     <title>Ecological risk due to river flow alteration under climate and socioeconomic change scenarios </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d8ef71eb-3d22-4f98-af15-9d8e046ccb63</link>     <description>This dataset contains modelled outputs of the European river network modelled as 33668 cells (5 degrees longitude by 5 degrees latitude).

The Land Ocean Interaction Study was a Natural Environment Research Council thematic programme which ran from 1992 to 2000 and involved over 360 scientists from 11 research institutes and 27 universities. The LOIS project was designed to study coastal processes and investigations covered river catchments, estuaries and coastal seas and their long-term evolution, air-sea interaction and shelf-edge interactions with the open ocean. The river catchment core monitoring includes the following data available for download: continuous in situ measurements of pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature; on site measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature; major ions and nutrients; herbicides; polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorobenzenes (CB) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides; triazine, organophosphate and pyrethroid (TOP) pesticides; and trace elements. Supporting documentation contains a list of all determinands measured and a list of sites, their locations and the frequency of sampling for each set of measurements.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T16:07:35Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/40ba6fd0-3d41-4520-8d78-cc8c893fd974\">     <title>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), chlorobenzenes (CB) and organochlorine pesticides (OC) data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/40ba6fd0-3d41-4520-8d78-cc8c893fd974</link>     <description>Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), chlorobenzenes (CB) and organochlorine pesticides (OC) data from river water collected at various sites within the Humber catchment area as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS).

The sampling and extraction of the pesticides was carried out by the LOIS team at York University and the elution and sample preparation for GC analysis was done at IFE.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atrazine</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cyanazin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Desmetryn</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Fenitrothion</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>HCH gamma</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Malathion</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Parathion</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Permethrin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Prometryn</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Simazine</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Terbutryn</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land Ocean Interaction Study project</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LOIS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Humber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Swale</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Derwent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calder</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Trent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ouse</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nidd</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T15:52:18Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e28ffc01-880d-423f-acb6-879b9fd4603a\">     <title>Micro-organic herbicides data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e28ffc01-880d-423f-acb6-879b9fd4603a</link>     <description>Micro-organic herbicide levels in river water for various sites within the Humber and Tweed catchments collected as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS). The dataset contains data for Phenyl urea and Phenoxy acid herbicides, measured as 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid, 4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid, Chlorotoluron dissolved, Diuron dissolved, Isoproturon dissolved, Linuron dissolved, Mecoprop dissolved. Phenyl urea herbicide data is available for twelve sites in the Humber catchment within 1994 to 1995 and 1994 to 1997 and for three sites on the Tweed catchment within 1995. Phenoxy acid herbicide data is available for six sites (S1, U3, N4, W5 and O6) over the period December 1994 to September 1995, for 7 sites (S2, D7, A8, C9, D10, T11 and O12) over the period December 1994 to February 1997 and 3 sites (TW13, TW14 and TW15) over the period January 1995 to September 1995. Attempts were made to sample the sites at weekly intervals. However sampling was halted for short periods when it was not possible to process the samples quickly. Linuron dissolved was only measured from April 1994 - October 1994. Samples were collected in chromic acid-washed 1 litre glass bottles. Herbicide levels were concentrated before being measured using High Performance Liquid Chromatography for Phenyl urea herbicides and Gas Chromatography for Phenoxy acid herbicides. Until November 1994, analysis was completed by the York University and the Institute for Freshwater Ecology, Wareham, laboratories. From December 1994 onwards the samples were dispatched to the Institute for Hydrology, Wallingford, for extraction and analyses.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Phenyl urea</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Phenoxy acid</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>herbicide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>2-4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>4-(4-Chloro-O-tolyloxy) butyric acid</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>4-Chloro-O-tolyloxyacetic acid</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chlorotoluron</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Diuron</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Isoproturon</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Linuron</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Mecoprop</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land Ocean Interaction Study</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LOIS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Humber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Swale</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Derwent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calder</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Trent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ouse</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nidd</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T12:13:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/69f62656-567c-42dd-bb65-8f0cbbeb1693\">     <title>Trace element data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/69f62656-567c-42dd-bb65-8f0cbbeb1693</link>     <description>Discrete data for trace elements for both the dissolved and acid available fractions for  thirteen core sites in the Humber catchment over the period 1993 to 1997 and for three sites from the Tweed catchment over the period 1994 to 1997.

Trace elements measured were: Aluminium (Al), Antimony (Sb), Arsenic (As), Barium (Ba), Beryllium (Be), Boron (B), Cadmium (Cd), Cerium (Ce), Chromium (Cr), Cobalt (Co), Copper (Cu), Gadolinium (Gd), Iron (Fe), Lanthanum (La), Lead (Pb), Lithium (Li), Manganese (Mn), Molybdenum (Mo), Neodymium (Nd), Nickel (Ni), Rubidium (Rb), Samarium (Sm), Scandium (Sc), Strontium (Sr), Tin (Sn), Uranium (U), Yttrium (Y), Zinc (Zn). The Core sites were sampled at regular weekly intervals and more intermittently during high flows (on average an extra sampling once a month per site). The Swale sites were sampled during hydrological events and the Aire sites were sampled both weekly and during hydrological events. The majority of samples were obtained using a wide neck grab sampler. Those samples collected from the Aire during hydrological events were obtained using EPIC automatic samplers. Both dissolved and acid available trace element fractions were determined for all samples. The dissolved fraction was measured by filtering samples and acidifying the filtrates with concentrated aristar grade nitric acid (1%vv) on the same day of sampling. The acid available fraction was determined by acidifying an unfiltered sample as above and agitating for 24 hours, at room temperature, prior to filtration. Samples were then analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES: B, Ba, Fe, Mn, Sr) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS: Al, As, Be, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Gd, La, Li, Mo, Nd, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Sn, U, Y, Zn).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aluminium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Antimony</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Arsenic</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Barium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Beryllium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Boron</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cadmium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cerium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chromium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cobalt</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Copper</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Gadolinium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Iron</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lanthanum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lead</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lithium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Manganese</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Molybdenum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Neodymium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nickel</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rubidium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Samarium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scandium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Strontium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Tin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Uranium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Yttrium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Zinc</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land Ocean Interaction Study project</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LOIS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Humber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Swale</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Derwent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calder</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Trent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ouse</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nidd</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T11:18:55Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/4482fa14-aee2-4c7f-9c62-a08dc9704051\">     <title>Major ion and nutrient data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/4482fa14-aee2-4c7f-9c62-a08dc9704051</link>     <description>Discrete data for major ions and nutrients in river water for 13 sites in the Humber catchment over the periods 1993 to 1997 and 1996 to 1997 and for 3 sites from the Tweed catchment over the period 1994 to 1997.

Part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) project.  Hydrolab H20 water quality monitors were installed at ten sites and used to log water temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen between 1994 and 1997. Data were collected continuously at 30 minute intervals (for periods of variable lengths depending on site) between 1994 and 1997. Data were collected using Hydrolab DataSonde 3 continuous monitoring units. Hydrolabs at River Nidd (Hunsingore) and the River Swale (Crakehill) were suspended from trees. The other hydrolabs were located in large steel pipes running from the bank into the rivers which allowed the flow of water over the probes but offered a high degree of safety from damage by vandals and large water borne objects. The units on the Trent and the Ouse at Skelton were fitted with stirrers, as the probes were prone to fouling by the high levels of suspended solids often encountered in these rivers during spate conditions. The deployment of the units and the collection of data were carried out by members of the field sampling team at York University, as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>temperature</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pH</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>conductivity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>dissolved oxygen</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrolab</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Humber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Swale</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Derwent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calder</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Trent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ouse</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nidd</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T10:54:28Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/329cbe8f-a292-4c5f-a15a-6528774dbee7\">     <title>Field measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/329cbe8f-a292-4c5f-a15a-6528774dbee7</link>     <description>On site measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature for thirteen sites in the Humber catchment and three sites in the Tweed catchment within the period 1994 to 1997 as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS).
