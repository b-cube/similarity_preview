Since the 1940s, these surveys have been produced quarterly through 1977 and monthly thereafter. The surveys conducted in 1998 focused on topics such as evaluations and expectations about personal finances, employment, price changes, and the national business situation. Opinions were collected regarding respondents' appraisals of present market conditions for purchasing houses, automobiles, computers, and other durables. Also explored in this survey, were respondents' types of savings and financial investments, loan use, family income, and retirement planning. Other topics in this series typically include ownership, lease, and use of automobiles, respondents' use of personal computers at home and in the office, and respondents' familiarity with and use of the Internet. Demographic information includes ethnic origin, sex, age, marital status, and education.         </abstract>                 <abstract>                    The purpose of this survey series is to forecast changes in aggregate consumer behavior.           </abstract>                                  <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1998-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-03</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1998-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-04</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1998-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-03</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1998-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-04</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                   <geogUnit>region</geogUnit>                   <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>             <anlyUnit>household</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Persons aged 18 years or older living in households with telephones within the United States.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    National sample of dwelling units selected by area probability sampling.          </sampProc>                                         <collMode>computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI)</collMode>                            <weight>               <p>The data are not weighted, however this collection contains three weight variables that can be used in analysis: V95 (ADULT WEIGHT), V96 (HOUSEHOLD WEIGHT), and WT (HOUSEHOLD WEIGHT (bracketed)).
