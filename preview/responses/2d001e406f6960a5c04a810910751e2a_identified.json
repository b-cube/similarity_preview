Such gradient compressions can result in a highly variable salinity environment and affect a diverse range of estuarine flora and fauna when even a small change in watershed runoff occurs. Rapid development within the bay&apos;s watershed has a changing effect on the amount, timing, and quality of runoff into the bay. Currently there is no information available to assess the effect that these alterations of runoff may have on the bay and its biota, nor to define watershed runoff and loading limits that provide desirable ranges in salinity and water quality at historical, current, and potential locations for seagrass, oysters, and other species of concern. To manage and preserve the Estero Bay ecosystem, it is necessary to: (1) understand the salinity patterns of the bay in relation to freshwater inflow and water exchange with the Gulf of Mexico; (2) describe the mixing and freshwater residence times within the bay; and (3) study the effects on light penetration from increased Total Suspended-Solids (TSS) load and re-suspension. Results from this study will facilitate management decisions geared toward defining flow and sediment loading limits that provide desirable ranges in salinity and water quality by providing necessary hydrological information.  To carry out the objectives of the study, a network of monitoring stations will be established and will include: (1) the monitoring of flow, water level, salinity, temperature, Acoustic Backscatter Strength (ABS), and turbidity near the mouth of three of four tributaries flowing into Estero Bay; (2) monitoring of water level, salinity, temperature, turbidity, wind speed and direction, and barometric pressure at one location inside the bay; (3) monitoring of water level, flow, salinity, temperature, and ABS at three of four tidal exchange points with the Gulf of Mexico along the barrier islands; (4) monitoring of water level (depth), salinity and temperature at one open-water location in the Gulf of Mexico. </purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>200110</begdate> <enddate>20050930</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-81.96</westbc> <eastbc>-81.83</eastbc> <northbc>26.47</northbc> <southbc>26.33</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>none</themekt> <themekey>stage</themekey> <themekey>salinity</themekey> <themekey>discharge</themekey> <themekey>temperature</themekey> <themekey>hydrology</themekey> <themekey>chemistry</themekey> <themekey>water quality</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>environment</themekey> <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey> <themekey>007</themekey> <themekey>012</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions,  Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4, Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology</placekt> <placekey>United States</placekey> <placekey>US</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1987, Codes for the identification of the States, the District of Columbia and the outlying areas of the United States, and associated areas (Federal Information Processing Standard 5-2): Washington, D.

Salinity and temperature were collected at Cow Creek for 2003 and at Fishtrap Bay near Bonita Beach for 2002-2005.  Stage, salinity, and temperature were collected at Boundary site-Matanzas Pass at Pass marker 1 for 2002-2004 and at Mullock Creek near mouth for 2002-2005.  Stage, salinity, temperature, and wind speed and direction were collected at Estero Bay near Horseshoe Keys for 2002-2005. </complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>unknown</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc> The description of salinity patterns for Estero Bay will be accomplished by determining freshwater residence times within the bay and by analyzing salinity data collected at the freshwater inflow points, the inner-bay, barrier islands boundary, and the open-water station. Analysis of turbidity data will be limited to inflow and inner-bay stations. Freshwater runoff residence times will be calculated by determining the period of time it takes for salinity to return to levels existing prior to storms or runoff events (managed releases at control structures). The significance of effects from hydrologic events on salinity patterns will be evaluated by measuring the extent of salinity variations prior, during, and after storms at all monitoring stations within the study area, and the effects on turbidity by measuring variations at inflow points due to increased flow and at the inner-bay by analyzing turbidity data in relation to wind speed and direction (sediment re-suspension). Freshwater flows from tributaries flowing into the bay will be determined from data currently collected and computed by the Fort Myers USGS Field office personnel in conjunction with calculated net flow data from tributary stations. Due to the location of the proposed sites and the availability of rainfall data from other agencies in areas nearby the study area, rainfall data will not be collected as part of the monitoring effort.  Water samples for TSS and SSC analyses will be collected near the mouth of the three tributaries flowing into Estero Bay. Both laboratory analyses will be done with duplicate samples in order to address possible bias as described in WRI 00-4191.   Continuous ABS and turbidity data will be collected at the three tributary sites and regression analyses will be used to determine if correlation can be obtained and time-series records of TSS concentrations produced. </procdesc> <procdate>2005</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Michael Byrne</cntper> <cntorg>U.S. Geologcial Survey</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address> 1400 Colonial Blvd.  Suite 70, Royal Palm Square </address> <city>Fort Myers</city> <state>FL</state> <postal>33907</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>239 275-8448 ext. 10</cntvoice> <cntfax>239 275-6820</cntfax> <cntemail>mbyrne@usgs.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </proccont> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>Estero Bay Aquatic Preserve</indspref> <direct>Point</direct> <ptvctinf> <sdtsterm> <sdtstype>Point</sdtstype> <ptvctcnt>10</ptvctcnt> </sdtsterm> </ptvctinf> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres>1</latres> <longres>1</longres> <geogunit>Degrees, minutes, and decimal seconds</geogunit> </geograph> <geodetic> <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn> <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum>National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929</altdatum> <altres>0.01</altres> <altunits>feet</altunits> <altenc>Explicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal coordinates</altenc> </altsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>Time is measured in 15 minute intervals Eastern Daylight Savings Time.
