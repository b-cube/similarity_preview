Within the context of this functional framework, the genome is organised, allowing contact between specific genomic regions and sub-compartments. Previous work has shown that genes in both cis and trans can make specific contacts with each other. I hypothesise that such a preferred juxtaposition may impact the propensity for specific cancerinitiating chromosomal translocations to occur.&#13; &#13; In this thesis, I describe how I have extended and developed a ligation based proximity assay known as enriched 4C. I have coupled this technique with high throughput sequencing to determine genomic regions that spatially co-associate with the proto-oncogenes MLL, ABL1 and BCR. In addition to further developing the laboratory protocol, I have created bioinformatics tools used in the analysis of the sequencing data. I find that the association profiles of the three genes show strong correlation to the binding profile of RNA polymerase II and other active marks, suggesting that transcribed genes have a propensity to associate with other transcribed regions of the genome. Each gene also exhibits a unique repertoire of preferred associations with specific regions of the genome. Significantly, I find that the most frequent trans association of BCR is telomeric chromosome 9, encompassing its recurrent translocation partner gene ABL1. Interestingly, ABL1 is not at the maximum point of interaction. I use DNA-fluorescence in-situ hybridisation to validate the e4C association.&#13; &#13; My data supports a hypothesis that gene transcription has a direct role on genome organisation. I suggest that preferred co-associations of genes at transcription factories may promote the occurrence of specific chromosomal translocations.

The 'Top-Scoring Pair' (TSP) classification method identifies pairs of genes whose relative expression correlates strongly with phenotype. In this study, we sought to assess the effectiveness of the TSP approach in the identification of diagnostic classifiers for a number of human diseases including bacterial and viral infection, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, Crohn's disease, and transformed ulcerative colitis. We examined transcriptional profiles from both solid tissues and blood-borne leukocytes. Results The algorithm identified multiple predictive gene pairs for each phenotype, with cross-validation accuracy ranging from 70 to nearly 100 percent, and high sensitivity and specificity observed in most classification tasks. Performance compared favourably with that of pre-existing transcription-based classifiers, and in some cases was comparable to the accuracy of current clinical diagnostic procedures. Several diseases of solid tissues could be reliably diagnosed through classifiers based on the blood-borne leukocyte transcriptome. The TSP classifier thus represents a simple yet robust method to differentiate between diverse phenotypic states based on gene expression profiles. Conclusion Two-transcript classifiers have the potential to reliably classify diverse human diseases, through analysis of both local diseased tissue and the immunological response assayed through blood-borne leukocytes. The experimental simplicity of this method results in measurements that can be easily translated to clinical practice.
