System Parameters/Flight Plan:  The LiDAR system acquisition parameters were developed based on a maximum average ground sample distance of 4 feet.  Two Leica ALS50 sensors were used for acquisition. Acquisition specifications for the two sensors were as follows:  Sensor 19 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 54.02 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 75,000 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.91 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.94 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1544.95 feet Side overlap - 25.31 percent  Sensor 59 Field of View (full angle) - 29 degrees Nominal flight altitude (AMSL) - 3999.30 feet Airspeed - 60.70 meters/sec Laser pulse rate - 84,400 Hz Nominal swath width (on ground) - 2068.58 feet Maximum cross track point spacing - 3.94 feet Maximum along track point spacing - 3.91 feet Average point spacing - 2.21 feet Flight line spacing - 1413.72 feet Side overlap - 31.66 percent.  LiDAR System Calibration:  Prior to the LiDAR acquisition, the system underwent a calibration to verify the operational accuracy and misalignment angles.  Boresight calibrations were performed for each LiDAR system at the beginning and end of each flight mission.  LiDAR Data Acquisition:  LiDAR data acquisition only occurred when the sky was sufficiently clear of clouds, smoke, and atmospheric haze.  The LiDAR data was processed immediately after the acquisition to verify the coverage had no voids.   GPS/Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Post Processing:  The GPS and IMU data was post processed using differential and Kalman filter algorithms to derive a best estimate of trajectory.  The quality of the solution was verified to be consistent with the accuracy requirements of the project.   LiDAR Processing and Classification: The LiDAR data was post processed and verified to be consistent with the project requirements in terms of post spacing and absence of artifacts.  The point cloud underwent classification to determine bare-earth points (class 2), noise points (class 7), water returns (class 9), and unclassified data (class 1).  Class 12 contains LiDAR points removed from the overlap region between adjacent flight lines. The MASSPOINT feature class contains ground (class 2) points only.  To create the MASSPOINT feature class, Ground (class 2) LAS points were extracted in ArcMap, using a Woolpert Team-developed VB script, and loaded into the Geodatabase as multipoint geometry.</abstract>    <purpose>The DTM was developed to support the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM) development and maintenance of Regional Evacuation Studies (Study), which include vulnerability assessments and assist disaster response personnel in understanding threats to Florida's citizens and visitors.</purpose>    <supplinf>A footprint of this data set may be viewed in Google Earth at: http://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/lidar1_z/geoid12a/data/4702/supplemental/fl2008_fdem_leecounty_m4702.kmz  A report for this dataset is available at:  http://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/lidar1_z/geoid12a/data/4702/supplemental/fl2008_fdem_leecounty_m4702_surveyreport.pdf</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>20071204</begdate>      <enddate>20071220</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>ground condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>As needed</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-82.367000</westbc>     <eastbc>-81.896157</eastbc>     <northbc>26.933504</northbc>     <southbc>26.403823</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>elevation</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>topography</themekey>     <themekey>las</themekey>     <themekey>elevation</themekey>     <themekey>LiDAR</themekey>     <themekey>DEM</themekey>     <themekey>Division of Emergency Management</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>Geographic Information &gt; LiDAR</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Land Surface &gt; Topography &gt; Terrain Elevation</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>NOAA NOS Harvest Catalog</themekt>     <themekey>CoRIS</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>None</placekt>     <placekey>United States</placekey>     <placekey>Florida</placekey>     <placekey>Lee County</placekey>    </place>    <place>     <placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt>     <placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Atlantic Ocean &gt; Gulf of Mexico &gt; Florida</placekey>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Florida</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since this data set was collected and some parts of this data may no longer represent actual surface conditions.
