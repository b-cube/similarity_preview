A 500-hpa closed low is predicted near the Aleutians. Ridging is forecast downstream of this feature over western North America from the northwestern CONUS northward to Alaska. However, models are trending toward weakening the ridge over the northwestern CONUS. Farther to the east, a low-amplitude trough is predicted over eastern North America. Ensemble spread is high over the southwestern CONUS as models are having difficulty resolving the details surrounding the potential for southern stream energy to undercut the ridge predicted over western North America. Disagreements are also evident over the eastern CONUS as the flow pattern depicted by the ECMWF-based solutions are more cyclonic relative to the flatter GFS-based solutions. The official 500-hpa manual height blend is composed primarily of the ensemble mean solutions based on considerations of recent skill and on analog correlations, which measure how closely the forecast pattern matches cases that have occurred in the past.   Above-normal temperatures are favored for southeastern Alaska, western CONUS, and northern plains underneath predicted ridging. There are enhanced probabilities of below-normal temperatures for parts of the northeastern CONUS consistent with GEFS reforecast guidance. Below-normal temperatures are also favored for parts of the western Gulf coast region consistent with bias corrected temperatures from the ECMWF ensemble members.  Chances for above-median precipitation are enhanced for most of eastern and central Alaska ahead of the closed 500-hpa low predicted near the Aleutians. There are enhanced probabilities of near to above-median precipitation for much of the west coast of the CONUS as models have trended wetter across this region. Near-median precipitation is favored for much of the southern tier of the CONUS and the east coast due to large disagreements between the GFS and ECMWF ensemble precipitation estimates. Agreement is better across the northern plains and Great Lakes regions where both the GFS and ECMWF ensembles favor below-median precipitation.<br><br><br><br>Today's official 500-HPA Blend Consists of 15% of Today's 0z GFS Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 25% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 25% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Yesterday's 12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, 10% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 5% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8  <br><br>Model of the Day: Today's 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean and today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean<br><br>Forecast confidence for the 6-10 day period: below average, 2 out of 5 due to large model disagreements over much of the forecast domain.<br><br>]]> </discussion></entry></item>",
