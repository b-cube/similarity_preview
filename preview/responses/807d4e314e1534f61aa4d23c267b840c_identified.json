Ostoji\\ufffd\\ufffd, Ljerka; Tkal\\ufffd\\ufffdi\\ufffd\\ufffd, Mladenka; Clayton, Nicola S. While dog owners claim that their dogs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd greeting behaviour after having performed a misdeed indicates&#13; the dogs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdguilt\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, current experimental evidence suggests that dogs show these \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdguilty look\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd behaviours&#13; as a response to being scolded by their owners. Given reports that \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdguilty look\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd behaviours are shown&#13; also in the absence of being scolded, we investigated whether the dogs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd own actions or the evidence&#13; of a misdeed might serve as triggering cues. We manipulated whether or not dogs ate a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdforbidden\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; food item and whether or not the food was visible upon the owners\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd return. Based on their dogs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd greeting&#13; behaviour, owners stated that their dog had eaten the food no more than expected by chance. In addition,&#13; dogs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd greeting behaviours were not affected by their own action or the presence or absence of the food.&#13; Thus, our findings do not support the hypothesis that dogs show the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdguilty look\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the absence of a&#13; concurrent negative reaction by their owners.

The binocular disparity between the views of the world registered by the left and right eyes provides a powerful signal about the depth structure of the environment. Despite increasing knowledge of the cortical areas that process disparity from animal models, comparatively little is known about the local architecture of stereoscopic processing in the human brain. Here, we take advantage of the high spatial specificity and image contrast offered by 7 tesla fMRI to test for systematic organization of disparity representations in the human brain. Participants viewed random dot stereogram stimuli depicting different depth positions while we recorded fMRI responses from dorsomedial visual cortex. We repeated measurements across three separate imaging sessions. Using a series of computational modeling approaches, we report three main advances in understanding disparity organization in the human brain. First, we show that disparity preferences are clustered and that this organization persists across imaging sessions, particularly in area V3A. Second, we observe differences between the local distribution of voxel responses in early and dorsomedial visual areas, suggesting different cortical organization. Third, using modeling of voxel responses, we show that higher dorsal areas (V3A, V3B/KO) have properties that are characteristic of human depth judgments: a simple model that uses tuning parameters estimated from fMRI data captures known variations in human psychophysical performance. Together, these findings indicate that human dorsal visual cortex contains selective cortical structures for disparity that may support the neural computations that underlie depth perception.

Dysfunction of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) impairs the ability of individuals to flexibly adapt behavior to changing stimulus-reward&#13; (S-R) contingencies. Impaired flexibility also results from interventions that alter serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) transmission in the&#13; OFC and dorsomedial striatum (DMS). However, it is unclear whether similar mechanisms underpin naturally occurring variations in&#13; behavioral flexibility. In the present study, we used a spatial-discrimination serial reversal procedure to investigate interindividual variability&#13; in behavioral flexibility in rats. We show that flexibility on this task is improved following systemic administration of the 5-HT reuptake&#13; inhibitor citalopram and by low doses of the DA reuptake inhibitor GBR12909. Rats in the upper quintile of the distribution of&#13; perseverative responses during repeated S-R reversals showed significantly reduced levels of the 5-HT metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic&#13; acid, in the OFC. Additionally, 5-HT2A receptor binding in the OFC of mid- and high-quintile rats was significantly reduced&#13; compared with rats in the low-quintile group. These perturbations were accompanied by an increase in the expression of monoamine&#13; oxidase-A (MAO-A) and MAO-B in the lateral OFC and by a decrease in the expression of MAO-A, MAO-B, and tryptophan&#13; hydroxylase in the dorsal raphe\\ufffd\\ufffd nucleus of highly perseverative rats. We found no evidence of significant differences in markers of DA&#13; and 5-HT function in the DMS or MAO expression in the ventral tegmental area of low- vs high-perseverative rats. These findings&#13; indicate that diminished serotonergic tone in the OFC may be an endophenotype that predisposes to behavioral inflexibility and other&#13; forms of compulsive behavior.

Residential location is thought to influence people\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds wellbeing, but different individuals may value&#13; the same residential areas differently. We examined how life satisfaction and personality traits are&#13; geographically distributed within the U.K. London metropolitan area, and how the strength of&#13; associations between personality traits and life satisfaction vary by residential location (i.e.,&#13; personality\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdneighborhood interactions). Residential area was recorded at the level of postal districts&#13; (216 districts, n=56,019 participants). The strength of associations between personality traits and life&#13; satisfaction were dependent on neighborhood characteristics. Higher openness to experience was&#13; more positively associated with life satisfaction in postal districts with higher average openness to&#13; experience, population density and ethnic diversity. Higher agreeableness and conscientiousness&#13; were more strongly associated with life satisfaction in postal districts with lower overall levels of life&#13; satisfaction. The associations of extraversion and emotional stability were not modified by&#13; neighborhood characteristics. These findings suggest that people\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds life satisfaction depends, at least&#13; in part, on the interaction between individual personality and particular features of the places they&#13; live.
