The primary IFSAR dataset was acquired by Intermap Technologies and contracted by the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation.  The raw data were collected with a STAR-3i airborne synthetic aperture radar system, a high-resolution, single pass, across track IfSAR system (Intermap, 2010). The Digital Surface Model (DSM) products represent the first reflective surface as illuminated by the radar.  The STAR-3i system is capable of acquiring imagery with a horizontal accuracy better than 2 m, a vertical accuracy better than 1 m, and a vertical resolution on the order of 0.1 m (Intermap, 2010).  Accuracy statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation.  In addition, the DSM contains processing artifacts expressing as 30 to 50 cm high ripples or 'corn rows' that should be considered causing additional vertical error in the dataset.  This striping results from uncompensated differential phase errors on very flat terrain. </abstract> <purpose>This dataset has been developed as an ancillary product related to extraction of a lake-based polygon vector layer for the Western Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska based on an IFSAR derived DSM.</purpose> <supplinf>The features were extracted by selecting areas greater than zero meters above sea level (masl) along the coastal zone.  The majority of the IFSAR data acquired along the coastal zone occurred in 2002.  However, a small segment near the western extent of this vector layer was acquired in 2003.  This has been noted in the attribute table.</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20020729</begdate> <enddate>20030807</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-158.581686</westbc> <eastbc>-150.776749</eastbc> <northbc>71.420611</northbc> <southbc>70.282781</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>User</themekt> <themekey>Digital Elevation Model</themekey> <themekey>Digital Surface Model</themekey> <themekey>IFSAR</themekey> <themekey>Surface Elevation</themekey> <themekey>Vector Coastline</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> </theme> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>It is strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of the metadata file associated with these data to evaluate data set limitations, restrictions or intended use.
