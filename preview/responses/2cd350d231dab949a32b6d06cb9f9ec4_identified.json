Improvements and additions to the standard are made continuously,                 in response to evolving technologies and the demands of the user community.             </p>                          <p>Technical development of the TEI Guidelines is organized and overseen by                 the <ref target=\"Council/\">TEI Technical Council</ref>.  While the Council undertakes much of this                 technical work itself, it also convenes <ref target=\"Workgroups/\">workgroups</ref> to address specific                 projects within a fixed time frame. Much of the TEI Technical Council's work can be seen in    the <ref target=\"Council/Meetings/\">minutes of its meetings</ref>, the    <ref target=\"http://lists.village.virginia.edu/pipermail/tei-council/\">public archives of its mailing list</ref>, and    the bug and feature request trackers on <ref target=\"http://tei.sourceforge.net\">the TEI's SourceForge site</ref>                 (see an <ref target=\"http://sourceforge.net/export/rss2_keepsake.php?group_id=106328\">RSS feed of recent activity</ref>).</p>   <p>The TEI Consortium also has a <ref target=\"/Board/\">Board of Directors</ref> which provides strategic direction and fiscal           oversight, marketing, and coordinates fundraising and membership.</p>                                       <p>The success of the TEI depends upon the active participation of its community of                  members and users.  Those involved in projects using the TEI Guidelines                 are strongly encouraged to subscribe to the <ref target=\"../Support/\">TEI-L</ref> mailing list,                 and to make others aware of their work by registering it                 on the <ref target=\"Projects/\">TEI projects page</ref>.  The TEI also                 supports a number of loosely-organized                  <ref target=\"SIG/\">Special Interest Groups</ref> (SIGs), which provide an opportunity                 for people with similar interests to collaborate and share ideas.              </p>                                       <p>To find out about training-related activities, see the <ref target=\"http://members.tei-c.org/Events\">events calendar</ref>.
