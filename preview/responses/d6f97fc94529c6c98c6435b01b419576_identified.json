Additional questions focused on the respondents' knowledge of and  opinions on the European Union (EU), including what sources of  information about the EU they used and whether their country had  benefited from being an EU member. This collection, which focuses on the  attitudes of young Europeans, merges replies from respondents aged 15-24  years in EUROBAROMETER 47.2: WOMEN AND CANCER, THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT,  AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, APRIL-JUNE 1997 (ICPSR 2090)  with an oversample of persons in the same age group. Respondents were  asked questions on a variety of topics, including the impact of the  European Union (EU) on their lives, areas in which the EU could be more  active, responsibility to the elderly, reasons for living longer at  home, when to have children, leisure activities, organizational  memberships, religious beliefs, immigrants, foreign travel and work  experiences abroad, languages spoken, and source of income. Opinions  were also elicited on euthanasia, capital punishment, rights of  homosexuals, compulsory AIDS testing, premarital and extramarital sex,  and cloning. Demographic and other background information provided  includes respondent's age, sex, religious preference, and income as well  as the occupation of both respondent and head of household, the number  of people residing in the home, the size of locality, and the region of residence.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1997-04-20\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-04-20</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1997-06-07\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-06-07</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1997-04-20\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-04-20</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1997-06-07\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-06-07</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Austria</geogCover>             <geogCover>Belgium</geogCover>             <geogCover>Denmark</geogCover>             <geogCover>Europe</geogCover>             <geogCover>Finland</geogCover>             <geogCover>France</geogCover>             <geogCover>Germany</geogCover>             <geogCover>Greece</geogCover>             <geogCover>Ireland</geogCover>             <geogCover>Italy</geogCover>             <geogCover>Luxembourg</geogCover>             <geogCover>Netherlands</geogCover>             <geogCover>Portugal</geogCover>             <geogCover>Spain</geogCover>             <geogCover>Sweden</geogCover>             <geogCover>United Kingdom</geogCover>                                 <universe>Citizens of the European Union aged 15 and over residing in  the 15 EU member countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France,  Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The first stage consisted of multistage national probability  samples.
