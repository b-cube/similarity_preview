Which is fine for global audiences, but if a film with a conservation message is aimed at a community, wouldn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt it be better if it was made by someone in that community?</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This is the premise behind <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://conservationfilms.org/community/\">Local action for global impact - community-based biodiversity conservation films</a>, a Leicester-led project which finished last month but will continue in a new form. To date, more than 80 young people in East Africa have been trained up in filming and editing techniques and between them they have produced about 200 short films on environmental themes.</p> <p>Dr David Harper from our <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\" title=\"Biology\" class=\"internal-link\">Department of Biology</a> has been instrumental in the project which was established in 2008 with funding from the UK Government\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/\">Darwin Initiative</a>. The initial idea came from <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.brockinitiative.org/\">Richard Brock</a>, who before becoming a freelancer, produced the first two of David Attenborough\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds amazing series <em>Life on Earth</em> and <em>The Living Planet</em>.</p> <p>After a decade of freelance film-making, Richard retired and resolved to give something back to the communities which he had visited on his travels. David Harper&nbsp;had known Richard since they met in Kenya in 2002 and together they applied for a grant with the aim of bringing film-making expertise and technology to areas which are \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbiodiversity rich but resources poor.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Aspiring film-makers are identified through existing ecological organisations and then given a few weeks\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd intensive training in all aspects of the process, both technical and logistical. They learn how to use a Panasonic or Canon digital video camera and how to edit on an Apple laptop in Final Cut Pro. They also learn sound recording techniques, good interviewing techniques and all the other skills required to create a short film which is good enough to show to an audience.</p> <p>The resulting films - usually in English but occasionally in Swahili, and subtitled in either \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are shown by local educational officers from the Government, NGOs and charities and have also been shown on Kenyan and Tanzanian TV. A ten-minute film that looks at a situation from the same point of view as its audience will always have much more effect than an hour of David Attenborough-narrated footage, however magnificently shot.</p> <p>There is no point in explaining the marvels of flamingos or monkeys to people who see such animals every day so the subjects covered are those which matter to local communities. The perils of erosion through over-grazing, for example, or the ecological benefits of bee-keeping.</p> <p>Although the funding ended in October 2010, the project continues as a not-for-profit company with the same name. Already it has become to some extent self-perpetuating as nearly half the trainees have actually been trained up by their peers.</p> <p>The only problem, David Harper notes, is that some of the equipment which was still under guarantee has been returned to the UK for repair. One of the perils of shooting in Africa: on removing the casing it was discovered that the laptops were full of insects and sand...</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conservation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Film</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2010-11-02T13:58:59Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/september/leicester-lab-learns-from-locust-limbs\">     <title>Leicester lab learns from locust limbs</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/september/leicester-lab-learns-from-locust-limbs</link>     <description>University of Leicester biologist awarded prestigious Fellowship for neurobiological study of extraordinary insects.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Dr Tom Matheson from our <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\" title=\"Biology\" class=\"internal-link\">Department of Biology</a> has recently been awarded a Research Development Fellowship by the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/\">Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</a> (BBSRC) to undertake work on \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcomputational approaches to an understanding of limb sensory-motor control\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

This makes them a <em>lot</em> less fiddly than, say, the fruitfly&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>.)</p> <p>Work in <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology/research/neuroscience/matheson-neurobiology\" title=\"Matheson Neurobiology Group\" class=\"internal-link\">Dr Matheson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds neurobiology lab</a>, investigating how nervous systems process sensory information and generate behaviours, involves two main projects:</p> <h2>Neuronal control of aimed limb movements</h2> <dl style=\"width:250px;\" class=\"image-right captioned\"> <dt><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/old-images/2011/september/locust%20diagrams.jpg/image\" alt=\"locust diagrams.jpg\" title=\"locust diagrams.jpg\" height=\"675\" width=\"250\" /></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:250px;\">Locusts are marked with stick-on reflective disks (1) and filmed from the side. Image processing software detects the markers (2), then reconstructs the body posture (3) and limb movements (4). Analysis software extracts relevant information, such as a probability distribution for the location of the foot(5).</dd> </dl> <p>The first project analyses the control of&nbsp;aimed limb movements like scratching. When a locust moves its leg in a particular way, what is going on within the nervous system?</p> <p>Gently brushing a locust\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds wing or abdomen causes it to move&nbsp;a leg to scratch the stimulated point. These aimed&nbsp;movements are not just stereotyped reflexes: they can be constantly adapted as the stimulus moves, and&nbsp;the two hind legs can also be co-ordinated in their responses. Yet previous work in the Matheson lab has demonstrated that these aimed movements are co-ordinated by neuronal activity within a restricted part&nbsp;of the insect\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds ventral nerve cord (being invertebrates, there is no spinal cord) without the signals going anywhere near the creature\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds brain.</p> <p>To study locust leg movements, the team attach reflective discs to strategic points on the insect which can be tracked by computer; essentially the same technology used to capture actors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd movements in films like <em>Avatar</em> and <em>The Polar Express</em>. Electrophysiological activity within specific&nbsp;nerve cells&nbsp;is recorded simultaneously and this is related to the animal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds leg movements.</p> <p>Work in the lab asks how the animals adapt to limb damage, and seeks to determine how groups of nerve cells are coordinated. An advantage of working in insects like the locust is that some cells are individually identifiable, so their roles in producing movements can be studied in great detail.</p> <p>During his BBSRC Fellowship, Matheson will be developing techniques to record the activity of many nerve cells simultaneously. The analysis techniques required to process these complex signals are developed in the lab of Matheson's collaborator, Rodrigo Quian Quiroga in our <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/engineering\" title=\"Engineering\" class=\"internal-link\">Department of Engineering</a>. The advances in signal processing developed in the locust will enhance the analysis of electrophysiological data from human subjects.</p> <h2>Phase change in desert locusts</h2> <p>A second project in the Matheson lab investigates processes associated with swarming. Locusts are famous for their swarming behaviour but what is not so widely known is that they undergo a physical and behavioural transformation before they swarm.</p> <p>When vegetation is relatively sparse and population densities are low, desert locusts are cryptically coloured and shy, moving little, often at night,&nbsp;and avoiding other locusts.&nbsp;In times of plenty, however, when the population rises so much that the insects are constantly bumping into one another, the locusts undergo an extraordinary transformation.</p> <dl style=\"width:250px;\" class=\"image-right captioned\"> <dt><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/old-images/2011/september/locustsol250.jpg/image\" alt=\"locustsol250.jpg\" title=\"locustsol250.jpg\" height=\"132\" width=\"250\" /></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:250px;\">Hopper in solitary phase. Before...</dd> </dl> <p>First to change is behaviour: the animals move more, generally during the day, and crucially become attracted to other locusts. Some of these changes can occur in just a few hours. Over weeks or several generations (the locust lifecycle is a couple of months long) the animals&nbsp;take on bright yellow and black colouration as juveniles, and they become larger. All of these changes are part of the&nbsp;switch from the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsolitary phase\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgregarious phase\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd - and then the swarming starts.</p> <p>The wingless juvenile nymphs (called hoppers for obvious reasons) change from green in their solitary phase to a black and yellow gregarious phase, and already show signs of swarming by forming into marching bands. This sort of change in behaviour and morphology is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddensity dependent phase polyphenism\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<strong>*</strong> and Dr Matheson and his colleagues are investigating the neuronal changes involved in this process.</p> <dl style=\"width:250px;\" class=\"image-right captioned\"> <dt><img src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/images/old-images/2011/september/locustgreg250.jpg/image\" alt=\"locustgreg250.jpg\" title=\"locustgreg250.jpg\" height=\"119\" width=\"250\" /></dt>  <dd class=\"image-caption\" style=\"width:250px;\">...and after. Hopper in gregarious phase.</dd> </dl> <p>They have found, for example, that solitary phase locusts have 30% more hairs on the femurs of their hind legs, where repeated tactile stimulation for as little as four hours is enough to trigger the phase change to the gregarious form.</p> <p>Another difference between the phases is in a visual nerve cell called the DCMD which stands rather wonderfully for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddescending contralateral movement detector\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which is used in detecting approaching objects. In gregarious locusts the cell remains very responsive in the face of repeated stimulation, whereas in solitary locusts the response quickly dwindles. The persistent responses in gregarious animals are thought to help locusts avoid colliding with each other when flying in dense&nbsp;swarms.&nbsp;The Leicester team are also investigating how phase change affects both ageing and circadian rhythms in behaviour.</p> <p>During his BBSRC Fellowship, Tom Matheson will be developing specialised recording techniques, updating his programming skills, working with collaborators in the UK and Germany, and completing a number of research papers. And his locusts will be scratching themselves without using their brains, changing their physical appearance and carrying on with all the other behaviours which make this insect such a fascinating and important experimental subject.</p> <p><strong>*</strong><em>Today\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds word is \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpolyphenism\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, the situation whereby two different physical states (phenotype) of a creature can result from a single genetic state (genotype), depending on non-genetic&nbsp;factors such as environment, food supply or, in this case, population density.

However, unlike most other places in the world with population problems, neither water nor energy should be a major limiting resource in Ethiopia. The fishing operation on Lake Hawassa was obviously providing a substantial amount of food protein to the whole area, as well as high employment \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd whether it is sustainable is debated, but the net size restriction, vegetarian nature of the fish (hence putting them low in the food chain), and the limited landing area probably mean that overexploitation is not as major a&nbsp;problem as some others that we saw (cutting wood for fuel, seen being incredibly wastefully used in the cooking at the end of the video), or overgrazing.</div> <div class=\"smallquotereference\">Professor Pat Heslop-Harrison</div> <p>A lot of Pat\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research involves bananas so, while in the Rift Valley, he also spent a lot of time looking at ensete, a closely related crop which is eaten by 10 million people in Southern Ethiopia.

We look at repetitive DNA and its evolution, with a particular focus on tandemly repeated satellite sequences and retrotransposons. Key methods include molecular cytogenetics, DNA sequence analysis and systems biology approaches. Taking a comparative genomics approach, we have interlinked projects with a range of different species: a particular focus is on plant crop species (banana, cereals including wheat, rye and barley, brassicas, and cowpea), while important projects include work with Dictyostelium, Drosophila, Scallops (Pecten), and bovids.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The main page is accessed from <a href=\"http://www.molcyt.com\">www.molcyt.com</a></p> <p></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>phh4</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biological Sciences</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2008-08-29T11:30:16Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/estates/environment/news/2013-news/hog-watchers-wanted\">     <title>Hog Watchers Wanted</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/estates/environment/news/2013-news/hog-watchers-wanted</link>     <description>Your help is required to locate Leicester's dwindling hedgehog population.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h4 class=\" \"><span>Hedgehogs have been in decline in recent years with no real estimate of their populations.
