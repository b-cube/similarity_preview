Around 50 ecological research projects are currently running, involving groups from several universities. Collaboration and knowledge-exchange opportunities are clear across this pool of Wytham scientists, yet such relationships can be slow to develop without a forum for collective discussions.</p> <p>This meeting will address this by bringing together all ecological scientists involved in Wytham research and other forest researchers, to determine how we can best learn from each other\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work. Talks from Wytham scientists will show the depth and breadth of research undertaken at Wytham, with contributions from early-career researchers. Panel sessions will enable further knowledge-exchange.</p> <p>The meeting is also open to any forest researchers who are interested in learning more about Wytham, or establishing links for future collaborative work within this network.</p> <p>Online registration will open shortly, so check the BES Forest Ecology Special Group page for updates:\\ufffd\\ufffd<a href=\"http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/forest-ecology-group/\">http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/getting-involved/special-interest-groups/forest-ecology-group/</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>External event</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>research</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-29T13:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/nfbr-conf-2015\">     <title>A Question of Ecology \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Answers from Biological Recording</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/nfbr-conf-2015</link>     <description>National Forum for Biological Recording conference 2015</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p><b>Note: There is a call for <span>quickfire talks, posters and demonstrations of software and tools</span></b></p> <p>Biodiversity information is crucial to understanding ecological relationships and supporting conservation effort in a changing climate.

This is a contribution to the global Future Earth programme, a 10-year international research initiative that will develop the knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change and supporting transformation towards global sustainability in the coming decades.</p> <p>Mountain areas occupy 24% of the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds land surface; they are home to 12% of the global population, and another 14% of the population live in their immediate proximity. Globally, mountain areas are vital sources of water for agricultural, industrial, and domestic use. They include major centres of biodiversity, often coinciding with centres of cultural diversity where traditional ecological knowledge is maintained. In an urbanising world, mountain areas are key locations for tourism and recreation; some include major urban areas.</p> <p>Mountain systems are particularly fragile, and subject to both natural and anthropogenic drivers of change. These range from volcanic and seismic events and flooding to global climate change and the loss of vegetation and soils because of inappropriate agricultural and forestry practices and extractive industries. Thus, many mountain ecosystems are moving along trajectories that couple high rates of environmental change with strong economic changes. The collective effect may be to alter the ability of these ecosystems to provide critical goods and services to both mountain and lowland populations. The vital linkages between mountain and lowland systems are increasingly recognised in global and regional policy debates and action. These diverse and inter-related issues have been addressed in two international conferences organised by the Centre for Mountain Studies in Perth, in 2005 and 2010, and provide the context for the 2015 conference.</p> <h2>Involvement of ECN partners &amp; LTER-Europe</h2> <p>Several sessions at the conference are relevant to anyone with an interest in long-term ecosystem research:</p> <ul> <li>Advances in observatories of mountain social-ecological systems (Jan Dick, CEH)</li> <li><span>LTSER sites in European mountain areas (Thomas Spiegelberger, Irstea)</span></li> </ul> <ul> <li>Mountain ecosystem services, adaptive management and global change (Maria Nijnik, JHI, with others)</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Conference</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>event:featured</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>External event</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-18T16:00:48Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/acid-rain-2015\">     <title>Acid Rain 2015</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/acid-rain-2015</link>     <description>9th International acid rain conference</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><span>The theme of Acid Rain 2015 is: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSuccesses Achieved and the Challenges Ahead\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

The first international acid rain conference, held in 1975 in Columbus, Ohio, provided a forum for scientists and policy makers to discuss the extent of environmental degradation caused by acid deposition and to inform future clean air policies. This conference has been held subsequently every five years across locations in Europe, Canada, and Asia (see \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPast Conferences\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd link to the left). Since 1975, emissions of SO2\\ufffd\\ufffdand NOx\\ufffd\\ufffdthat cause acid rain have declined broadly across North America and Europe, and recent data suggest some progress in controlling emissions in parts of Asia as well. Recent research also shows important links between acid deposition and climate change, and the mutual interactions of S and N air pollutants with Hg, CO2, CH4, and ozone, among others.</p> <p>Now, the\\ufffd\\ufffdInternational Acid Rain Conference is returning to the US for the first time since 1975. Join us on\\ufffd\\ufffdOctober 19-23, 2015 in Rochester, New York to share the latest information and research on acid rain: environmental effects, the status of recovery across affected regions, and new policies that will define the future.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-02-06T14:30:19Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>      </rdf:RDF> ",
