On each reef, we conducted fish surveys, behavioral observations, and benthic surveys in three habitat types: high-relief spur and groove (depth 2 - 6 m), low-relief carbonate platform/hardbottom (depth 4 - 12 m), and carbonate boulder/rubble fields (depth 4 - 9 m).In addition, fish surveys were also conducted on a fourth high-relief spur-and-groove reef (French). We estimated parrotfish abundance in each of the three habitat types in order to assess the relative abundance and biomass of different species and to quantify differences in habitat selection. To estimate parrotfish density, we conducted 20 to 30 minute timed swims while towing a GPS receiver on a float on the surface to calculate the amount of area sampled. During a swim the observer would swim parallel with the habitat type being sampled and count and estimate the size to the nearest cm of all parrotfishes &gt; 15 cm in length that were encountered in a 5 m wide swath. To quantify parrotfish behavior, approximately six individuals of each species were observed at each site for 20 min each. Foraging behavior was recorded by a SCUBA diver while towing a GPS receiver (Garmin GPS 72) attached to a surface float, which obtained position fixes of the focal fish at 15 s intervals. Fish were followed from a close distance (~ 2 m when possible), and food items were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible, with macroalgae and coral usually identified to genus or species. Many bites involved scraping or excavating substrate colonized by a multi-species assemblage of filamentous \\ufffd\\ufffdturf\\ufffd\\ufffd algae and crustose coralline algae (CCA). Thus, multiple species of filamentous algae, endolithic algae, and CCA could be harvested in a single bite, and it was impossible to determine the specific species of algae targeted. We also recorded the type of substrate targeted during each foraging bout, categorizing each substrate as one of the following: (1) dead coral, (2) coral pavement, (3) boulder, (4) rubble, or (5) ledge. Dead coral included both convex and concave surfaces on the vertical and horizontal planes of three dimensional coral skeletons (primarily dead Acropora palmata) that were attached to reef substrate. Coral pavement was carbonate reef with little topographic complexity (i.e., flat limestone pavement). Boulder was large remnants of dead mounding corals not clearly attached to the bottom and often partially buried in sand. Coral rubble consisted of small dead coral fragments (generally &lt; 10 cm in any dimension) that could be moved with minimal force. Ledges consisted entirely of the undercut sides of large spurs in the high-relief spur and groove habitat. In order to quantify the relative abundance of different food types, we estimated the percent cover of algae, coral, and other sessile invertebrates on each of the five substrates commonly targeted by parrotfishes (dead coral, coral pavement, boulder, rubble, or ledge) in 0.5 m x 0.5 m photoquadrats. We photographed a total of 8 haphazardly selected quadrats dispersed throughout the study site for each substrate type at each of the three sites (N = 24 quadrats per substrate type, N = 120 quadrats total).  Each photoquadrat was divided into sixteen 12 cm x 12 cm sections which were individually photographed, and percent cover was estimated from 9 stratified random points per section (N = 144 point per quadrat).</abstract>    <purpose>To document patterns of resource-use of Caribbean parrotfishes</purpose>       </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>20130619</begdate>      <enddate>20130730</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>ground condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>None</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-80.38</westbc>     <eastbc>-80.21</eastbc>     <northbc>25.22</northbc>     <southbc>25.00</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>none</themekt>     <themekey>Scarus coelestinus</themekey>     <themekey>Scarus coeruleus</themekey>     <themekey>Scarus guacamaia</themekey>     <themekey>Scarus taeniopterus</themekey>     <themekey>Scarus vetula</themekey>     <themekey>Sparisoma aurofrenatum</themekey>     <themekey>Sparisoma chrysopterum</themekey>     <themekey>Sparisoma rubripinne</themekey>     <themekey>Sparisoma viride</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Algal Cover</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Calcareous Macroalgae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Coralline Algae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Crustose Coralline Algae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Encrusting Macroalgae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Fleshy Macroalgae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Vegetation &gt; Algae &gt; Turf Algae</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Predation &gt; Coral Predation</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Herbivory</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Dominance &gt; Keystone Species</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish Assemblages</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish Behavior</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fishing</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>biota</themekey>     <themekey>002</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>Numeric Data Sets > Biology</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CRCP Project</themekt>     <themekey>The Importance of Parrotfish (fam.
