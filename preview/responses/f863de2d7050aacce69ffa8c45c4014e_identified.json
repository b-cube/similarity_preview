The NAIP acquires digital ortho imagery during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S.. A primary goal of the NAIP program is to enable availability of ortho imagery within one year of acquisition.  The NAIP provides two main products: 1 meter ground sample distance (GSD) ortho imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy within +/- 5 meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho imagery rectified within +/- 6 meters to true ground.  The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.  The NAIP imagery is formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  The NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.   The quarter quads have been reprojected from UTM 11 or  UTM 12 to IDTM83 projection (ESPG 102605), mosaicked  into 100k tiles, and compressed using ERDAS Imagine for  use in ArcGIS.</abstract><purpose>The NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies who use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment.  The NAIP is also used for disaster response often providing the most current pre-event imagery.</purpose></descript><timeperd><current>Photography Source Image Dates.</current><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20090624</begdate><enddate>20090820</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>None planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-114.002476</westbc><eastbc>-112.992454</eastbc><northbc>44.004285</northbc><southbc>43.495548</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>farming</themekey><themekey>Digital Ortho rectified Image</themekey><themekey>Mosaic</themekey><themekey>Quarter Quadrangle Centered</themekey><themekey>Ortho Rectification</themekey><themekey>Compression</themekey><themekey>MrSID</themekey><themekey>JPEG 2000</themekey><themekey>NAIP</themekey><themekey>Compliance</themekey><themekey>Aerial Compliance</themekey></theme><place><placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt><placekey>Ada CO., ID FSA</placekey><placekey>FIPS 16001</placekey><placekey>Ada</placekey><placekey>Idaho</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None, The USDA-FSA Aerial Photography Field Office asks to be credited in derived products.

A 500m reduced resolution NED DEM file was used to determine ground heights.  Altitudes averaging 35,000 feet MSL (mean sea level) were used in the flight plan.A minimum forward overlap of 60% and minimum side overlap of 35% were used.  No ground elevation in the project area resulted in source pixel dimensions greater than 1.05m or less than 0.5m.  Cessna Conquest aircraft were used for acquisition.  The aircraft AGL was nominally 30,000 feet above ground. Three Intergraph Digital Mapping Camera (DMC) systems where utilized in the data capture. The DMC is a digital frame camera that produces a central perspective image with a nominal focal length of 120mm projecting an image on a virtual CCD measuring 13,824 by 7,680 pixels.  The pixels are 12um by 12 um.  Images from four panchromatic cameras modules, each with a 120mm lens projecting an image on a 7,168 by 4,096 CCD, are assembled to create the virtual frame.  Images captured simultaneously from four 3,072 by 2,048 pixel multispectral (MS) cameras with 30mm lenses produce red, green, blue and near infrared images.  These MS images are matched to the Pan virtual image using the Post Processing Software from Intergraph.  All DMC systems used for capture have been calibrated by the manufacturer.  The calibration includes measuring the radiometric and geometric properties of each camera.  These data are used in the Post Processing Software to eliminate the radiometric and geometric distortion.  The raw captured pixel resolution of the panchromatic virtual frame averages 0.92m across the project area depending on terrain height.  Each pixel is assigned a 12 bit digital number (DN) by the analog to digital conversion performed after each exposure. Each pixel is resampled during orthorectification to an output resolution of 1m at a bit depth of 8 for each image band.  Four bands of data were captured for each image; Blue: 400-580 nm, Green: 500-650 nm, Red: 590-675 nm and Near infrared: 675-850 nm.  The final product may only include the RGB data.  All aerial imagery was collected with associated GPS data.  When possible most imagery will also include IMU data collection.   GPS/IMU data were captured with either an Applanix POS 510 system or IGI AEROControl.  The GPS data was utilized to control the aerial triangulation process.  All imagery was processed through an aerial triangulation in which the airborne GPS data was constrained to expected limits.  Analysis was performed to assure that all image frames fit within a strip and between strips by evaluating the image and airborne GPS residuals.  The final adjustments assure a high quality relative adjustment and a high quality absolute adjustment limited to the airborne GPS data accuracy.  This process assures the final absolute accuracy of all geopositioned imagery.  Both signalized and photo identified ground control were used to QC and control the IMU/GPS based aerial triangulation bundle block solution.  For each project area the latest NED was downloaded from the USGS National Map Seamless Serve website, http://seamless.usgs.gov/website/seamless/viewer.htm, in June 2009.  30 Meter NED was used in all cases.  30 meter post spacing was preferred over the available 10 meter spacing to minimize image smearing and distortions that are exacerbated by a finer, but not more accurate DEM.  A visual inspection of the NED using color cycled classification by elevation and a shaded relief was performed to check for gaps, corruption and gross errors.  When available the NED was compared to known higher quality elevation sources to detect flaws. Between 20-60 construction points per frame derived from conjugant image measurements performed during aerial triangulation were projected to the NED.  The predicted horizontal error for each point was added as an attribute in the SURDEX enterprise database.  An operator reviews ortho seams in areas these predicted errors indicate horizontal error in excess of the contract specifications.  Any imagery errors introduced by source NED required patching from an alternate DEM or frame of photography with a different perspective.  Hardware used included the DMC, various brands of L1/L2 Survey grade GPS receivers, various brands and models of computers, RAID5 storage, solid state storage, NEC brand calibrated monitors, various brands of monitor calibration colorimeters.  Software included Intergraph Post Processing Software (PPS) to handle camera raw images processed to virtual frame panchromatic images and four band multispectral images.  SURDEX software was used to color correct and remove bidirectional reflectance, vignetting and other illumination trends.  USDA APFO Image Metrics are measured and images corrected to conform to the Image Metrics using SURDEX software.  SURDEX software was then used to fuse the high resolution pan with the lower resolution multispectral image.  This image was upsampled to match the pan resolution using bilinear interpolation and converted to a high resolution image via the Brovey Transform. GPS/IMU data was reduced to projected coordinates in the appropriate UTM zone using the Applanix or IGI office software. Aerial Triangulation was performed using Intergraph ImageStation Automatic Triangulation (ISAT), ImageStation Digital Mensuration (ISDM) and Photo-T bundle adjustment.  SURDEX software was used to determine the weak points in the AT construction point distribution.  SURDEX software was used to orthorectify the images.  SURDEX software was used to compare overlapping orthoimages and correct for minor radiometric variation between adjacent images.  SURDEX software was used to calculate the optimal seam path, check seam topology and create master tiles.  SURDEX ortho software generates occlusion/smear polygons used during seam review to cut in the best view of steep terrain.  SURDEX software was used to visually inspect master tiles for seam and image defects.  SURDEX software was used to project and cut final DOQQ image files from masters.  SURDEX software was used to perform final formatting, QC and naming of the DOQQ.  Various versions of Microsoft Windows were used in all phases of production.  For Radiometry, SURDEX Grouping Tool was used to display large groups of images, display individual and group histograms, and develop color correction parameters to adjust image DN.  Grouping Tool provides real-time updates of the USDA APFO Image Metrics.  The image technician adjusts image correction parameters to bring the radiometric characteristics of large groups of raw images within the Image Metrics ranges.  Grouping Tool was used again after DOQQ production to provide a quality assurance check.  Individual DOQQ may not meet the USDA APFO Image Metrics ranges due to land cover.  The goal is to have the state as a whole meet the Image Metrics. To validate the accuracy of the block adjustment derived from GPS, IMU, camera parameters and conjugate point measurements photo identifiable ground control points will be surveyed within each State.  In Idaho, 55 survey control points were utilized.  These points were surveyed by GPS techniques to produce coordinates that are accurate to +/- 0.25 meters RMSE in X,Y,Z.  The GPS surveying techniques utilized will assure that the coordinates are derived in the required project datum and relative to an approved National Reference System like OPUS.  An accuracy report was generated to document the point locations, their description, the final adjusted values and the derived positional accuracy.   The field surveying techniques may consist of static OPUS observations, static GPS observations, real time differential GPS observations and VRS observations.  The control points were measured on multiple photographs, initially solved as check points and the bundle was rerun including all points as control.  After the checkpoint run the residual errors were reviewed to determine the quality of the solution with only GPS and IMU based initial exterior orientation.  If the block does not fit the control points within specifications the pass and tie points were reviewed for blunders and weak areas.  If, after these corrections were made, the block still does not fit the control well the GPS and IMU processing were reviewed.  Once the block has proper statistics and fits the control to specifications the final bundle adjustment was made.  SURDEX software was used to predict the horizontal error that results from DEM error using AT construction points projected to the NED ground elevation.  As AT points are frequently on man-made and other vertical features not included in the DEM these ortho points can only be used to indicate regions of error by the clusters of points that predict excessive horizontal displacement.  If these areas were found the source of the error was corrected and the DOQQ were recreated.  All reliable survey control points were remeasured in the final DOQQ to ensure the 6m CE95 absolute accuracy was met. All products are reviewed by independent personnel prior to delivery.  The delivery is checked for omissions, commissions, naming, formatting, specification compliance and data integrity.</procdesc></procstep><procstep><procdate>20090322</procdate><procdesc>The quarter quad images were reprojected using a Python script originally created and modified by Mathew Stayner (Bowen Collins) and Trent Hare (USGS), respectively.
