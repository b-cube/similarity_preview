Zebra mussels colonize water intake pipes and severely restrict the water flow. This has cost billions of dollars of damage to municipal and private facilities that rely on fresh water. This map layer shows the locations of confirmed zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to 1998. The sighting reports came from a variety of federal, State, and municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and private consultant firms, and businesses. The concern caused by the explosive spread of the zebra mussel, (Dreissena polymorpha), within the United States resulted in passage of the Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990. The impact of this biofouling pest on the economy and ecological processes in the U.S. and Canada has required prompt action on a large scale to prevent further infestations and minimize ecological degradation. This data set is a compilation of reports of confirmed zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to the present. It provides geographical and historical information to show distribution over time. The reports came from a variety of federal, State, and municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and private consultant firms. The locations of confirmed sightings were registered at 1:100,000-scale on EPA Reach File Version 3.0 and are maintained as an Arc/INFO export file. This is a revised version of the June, 2000 data set.</abstract>         <purpose>The data is an essential part of the Department of the Interior's Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Species Program. The data was compiled for use by resource managers to make them aware of zebra mussel occurrences so that they may help to control or prevent the spread of zebra mussels. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.</purpose>         <supplinf>The original of this data set was published for and presented at the Third International Zebra Mussel Conference, held February 23-26, 1993 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. That data set was compiled by the Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto, CA, and published in June, 1993, as \"A Geographic Information System (GIS) for Tracking Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha)in the United States\". The current data set builds on that original work.

Some of the reports were as latitude-longitude coordinates, some as river miles, and others as just a lake, beach, harbor, or a water body and nearest town name. The locations were digitized as a single point in the reported water body at the place nearest to the town. If no specific location was reported in a lake, the point was digitized in the middle. These were all small lakes; the Great Lakes had specific locations associated with them. Each zebra mussel sighting location was checked by manual comparison of the on-screen point with hard copy maps.</horizpar>        </horizpa>      </posacc>       <lineage>        <srcinfo>          <srccite>            <citeinfo>              <origin>Sources for these data are numerous.

Points were compared to the Streams and Waterbodies data layer, and several points were adjusted to fall on water features rather than on land. Also, the file was compared to the County Boundaries layer; several points were adjusted to fall in the correct county and State as listed in their location descriptions. Attribute items that had specified the age classification and substrate to which the specimen was attached were dropped.</procdesc>           <srcused>ZMR</srcused>           <srcused>Atlas-HYDRO</srcused>           <srcused>Atlas-CNTY</srcused>           <srcused>Atlas-ZML00</srcused>           <procdate>2001</procdate>        </procstep>      </lineage>    </dataqual>     <spdoinfo>      <direct>Point</direct>       <ptvctinf>        <sdtsterm>          <sdtstype>Point</sdtstype>           <ptvctcnt>2306</ptvctcnt>        </sdtsterm>      </ptvctinf>    </spdoinfo>     <spref>      <horizsys>        <geograph>          <latres>0.000278</latres>           <longres>0.000278</longres>           <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>        </geograph>         <geodetic>          <horizdn>North American Datum of 1927</horizdn>           <ellips>Clarke 1866</ellips>           <semiaxis>6378206.4</semiaxis>           <denflat>294.98</denflat>        </geodetic>      </horizsys>    </spref>     <eainfo>      <detailed>        <enttyp>          <enttypl>Zebra mussel location (described by Zmusslx020.dbf)</enttypl>           <enttypd>The location where a zebra mussel has been sighted</enttypd>           <enttypds>U.S. Geological Survey</enttypds>        </enttyp>         <attr>          <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl>           <attrdef>The representation of the entity in the data.</attrdef>           <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>           <attrdomv>            <edom>              <edomv>Point</edomv>               <edomvd>0-dimensional element</edomvd>               <edomvds>ESRI GIS software</edomvds>            </edom>          </attrdomv>        </attr>         <attr>          <attrlabl>Area</attrlabl>           <attrdef>The size of the shape in coverage units</attrdef>           <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>           <attrdomv>            <rdom>              <rdommin>0.000</rdommin>               <rdommax>0.000</rdommax>            </rdom>          </attrdomv>        </attr>         <attr>          <attrlabl>Perimeter</attrlabl>           <attrdef>The perimeter of the shape in coverage units</attrdef>           <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>           <attrdomv>            <rdom>              <rdommin>0.000</rdommin>               <rdommax>0.000</rdommax>            </rdom>          </attrdomv>        </attr>         <attr>          <attrlabl>Zmusslx020</attrlabl>           <attrdef>Internal feature number</attrdef>           <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>           <attrdomv>            <rdom>              <rdommin>1</rdommin>               <rdommax>2306</rdommax>            </rdom>          </attrdomv>        </attr>         <attr>          <attrlabl>Y</attrlabl>           <attrdef>The year of the zebra mussel sighting</attrdef>           <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>           <attrdomv>            <rdom>              <rdommin>1988</rdommin>               <rdommax>2001</rdommax>            </rdom>          </attrdomv>        </attr>         <attr>          <attrlabl>St</attrlabl>           <attrdef>The 2-letter FIPS code for the State in which the zebra mussel sighting falls, or a three-letter abbreviation for the Canadian province in which the sighting falls</attrdef>           <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>           <attrdomv>            <codesetd>              <codesetn>Codes for the Identification of the States, the District of Columbia and the Outlying Areas of the United States, and Associated Areas, FIPS PUB 5-2.</codesetn>               <codesets>U.S. Department of Commerce</codesets>            </codesetd>          </attrdomv>           <attrdomv>            <edom>              <edomv>ONT</edomv>               <edomvd>Province of Ontario, Canada.</edomvd>               <edomvds>U.S. Geological Survey</edomvds>            </edom>             <edom>              <edomv>QUE</edomv>               <edomvd>Province of Quebec, Canada.</edomvd>               <edomvds>U.S. Geological Survey</edomvds>            </edom>          </attrdomv>        </attr>         <attr>          <attrlabl>Co</attrlabl>           <attrdef>The name of the county where the zebra mussel sighting falls.
