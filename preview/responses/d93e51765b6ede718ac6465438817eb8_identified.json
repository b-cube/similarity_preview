The phenomenon under investigation is very peculiar because besides being of brief duration, it is characterized by a pronounced compression of the ionosphere. The phenomenon was studied and analyzed using both the F2 layer critical frequency (foF2) and the virtual height of the base of the F region (h'F) values recorded at five ionospheric stations widely distributed in space, namely: Jicamarca (-12.0\\ufffd\\ufffd, -76.8\\ufffd\\ufffd, magnetic latitude -2.0\\ufffd\\ufffd), Peru; Sao Luis (-2.6\\ufffd\\ufffd, -44.2\\ufffd\\ufffd, magnetic latitude +6.2\\ufffd\\ufffd), Cachoeira Paulista (-22.4\\ufffd\\ufffd, -44.6\\ufffd\\ufffd, magnetic latitude -13.4\\ufffd\\ufffd), and Sao Jose\\ufffd\\ufffd dos Campos (-23.2\\ufffd\\ufffd, -45.9\\ufffd\\ufffd, magnetic latitude -14.1\\ufffd\\ufffd), Brazil; Tucum\\ufffd\\ufffdn (-26.9\\ufffd\\ufffd, -65.4\\ufffd\\ufffd, magnetic latitude -16.8\\ufffd\\ufffd), Argentina. In a more&#xD; restricted region over Tucum\\ufffd\\ufffdn, the phenomenon was also investigated by the total electron content (TEC) maps computed by using measurements from 12 GPS receivers. A detailed analysis of isoheight ionosonde plots suggests that traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) caused by gravity wave (GW) propagation could play a significant role in causing the phenomenon both for quiet and for medium/high geomagnetic activity; in the latter case however a recharging of the fountain effect, due to electric fields penetrating from the&#xD; magnetosphere, joins the TID propagation and plays an as much significant role in causing impulsive electron density enhancements.</description>     <dc:date>2014-07-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9045\">     <title>Decoupling of ground level pressures observed in Italian volcanoes: are they driven by space weather geo-effectiveness?</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9045</link>     <description>Title: Decoupling of ground level pressures observed in Italian volcanoes: are they driven by space weather geo-effectiveness? Authors: Madonia, P.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia; Romano, P.; INAF- Osservatorio Astrofisico di Catania, Italy; Inguaggiato, S.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Palermo, Palermo, Italia Abstract: Investigations on correlation drops between near-ground atmospheric&#xD; pressures measured at sea level and at higher altitudes on Italian volcanoes&#xD; have been carried out. We looked for perturbations of the atmospheric&#xD; pressure field driven by volcanic activity, but not excluding possible&#xD; external triggers for the observed anomalies. Decorrelations between atmospheric&#xD; pressures measured at Stromboli Island in stations located at&#xD; different altitudes (years 2002-10) have been analysed and compared with&#xD; data from other volcanic (Vesuvius) and non volcanic (Mt. Soro) orographic&#xD; structures. We investigated as their possible triggers volcanic, meteorological&#xD; and space weather parameters, with particular attention to&#xD; Total Solar Irradiance (TSI), Kp index and Forbush decreases. Pressure&#xD; decorrelations seems to be driven by astronomic cycles, with maxima in&#xD; summer and minima in winter. A further contribution was found, seemingly&#xD; assignable to TSI anomalies, with correlation minima occurring 12&#xD; hours after these but only during phases of high Sun activity. Moreover,&#xD; during the same phases a main periodicity of about 27 days in pressure&#xD; decorrelations was revealed by FFT analysis. This period is the same of&#xD; the Sun Carrington rotation, expressing the periodic reappearance of&#xD; sunspot groups on Sun\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds surface. The strong similarity between recurrences&#xD; of sunspot number and atmospheric pressure anomalies further&#xD; supports the role of the former as a possible trigger for the latter.</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8895\">     <title>Permutation entropy analysis of complex magnetospheric dynamics</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8895</link>     <description>Title: Permutation entropy analysis of complex magnetospheric dynamics Authors: Consolini, G.; INAF-Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, Via del Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Roma, Italy; De Michelis, P.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: The present study is focused on the emergence of dynamical complexity in the Earth's magnetospheric dynamics during magnetic storms as monitored by SYM-H index. A long time series of SYM-H index covering the period from January 2000 to December 2004 is analyzed using a quite novel technique, the permutation entropy analysis. We show that the normalized permutation entropy values of the SYM-H time series decrease during geomagnetic disturbed periods revealing a gradual increase in the temporal correlation of the fluctuations which generates a gradual increase in the complexity degree of the magnetosphere response to the solar wind magnetic field and plasma parameter changes. These large changes in the normalized permutation entropy values and complexity degree observed during the disturbed periods can be interpreted as the signature of dynamical phase transitions happening in proximity to the occurrence of geomagnetic storms and substorms confirming results previously found using different methods. The dependence of the degree of complexity on both the magnitude of the geomagnetic disturbance and the IMF ByGSM and BzGSM components is investigated and discussed.</description>     <dc:date>2012-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8893\">     <title>Intermittency and multifractional Brownian character of geomagnetic time series</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8893</link>     <description>Title: Intermittency and multifractional Brownian character of geomagnetic time series Authors: Consolini, G.; Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, 00133 Rome, Italy; De Marco, R.; INAF \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali, 00133 Rome, Italy; De Michelis, P.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: The Earth's magnetosphere exhibits a complex behavior in response to the solar wind conditions. This behavior, which is described in terms of mutifractional Brownian motions, could be the consequence of the occurrence of dynamical phase transitions. On the other hand, it has been shown that the dynamics of the geomagnetic signals is also characterized by intermittency at the smallest temporal scales. Here, we focus on the existence of a possible relationship in the geomagnetic time series between the multifractional Brownian motion character and the occurrence of intermittency. In detail, we investigate the multifractional nature of two long time series of the horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetic field as measured at L'Aquila Geomagnetic Observatory during two years (2001 and 2008), which correspond to different conditions of solar activity. We propose a possible double origin of the intermittent character of the small-scale magnetic field fluctuations, which is related to both the multifractional nature of the geomagnetic field and the intermittent character of the disturbance level. Our results suggest a more complex nature of the geomagnetic response to solar wind changes than previously thought.</description>     <dc:date>2013-06-30T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8813\">     <title>Monitoraggio sismico del territorio nazionale: stato dell'arte e sviluppo delle reti di monitoraggio sismico</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8813</link>     <description>Title: Monitoraggio sismico del territorio nazionale: stato dell'arte e sviluppo delle reti di monitoraggio sismico Authors: Sergio, Guardato; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione OV, Napoli, Italia Abstract: Il sistema CUMAS (Cabled Underwater Module&#xD; for Acquisition of Seismological data) \\ufffd\\ufffd un&#xD; prodotto tecnologico-scientifico complesso nato&#xD; con il Progetto V4 [Iannaccone et al., 2008] allo&#xD; scopo di monitorare l\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdarea vulcanica dei Campi&#xD; Flegrei (fenomeno del bradisismo).&#xD; Si tratta di un modulo sottomarino cablato e&#xD; connesso a una boa galleggiante (meda elastica).

On the other hand, it is amply demonstrated that scaling properties of geomagnetic time series show significant changes depending on the geomagnetic activity level. Here, we study the multiscale&#xD; features of some large geomagnetic storms by applying the empirical mode decomposition technique. This method, which is alternative to traditional data analysis and is designed&#xD; specifically for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary data, is applied to long time series of Sym-H index relative to periods including large geomagnetic disturbances. The&#xD; spectral and scaling features of the intrinsic mode functions(IMFs) into which Sym-H time series can be decomposed, as well as those of the Sym-H time series itself, are studied considering different geomagnetic activity levels. The results&#xD; suggest an increase of dynamical complexity and multi-scale properties for intermediate geomagnetic activity levels.</description>     <dc:date>2012-10-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7443\">     <title>Anomalies of oxygen measurements performed with Aanderaa optodes</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7443</link>     <description>Title: Anomalies of oxygen measurements performed with Aanderaa optodes Authors: Lo Bue, Nadia; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Editors: L\\ufffd\\ufffdzaro, Antoni M\\ufffd\\ufffdnuel; Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) Abstract: Four sets of measurements performed between 2005 and 2010 in the deep central Atlantic, and in&#xD; deep Mediterranean Sea, and the Arctic Ocean revealed a strange performance of Aanderaa Optode&#xD; 3830 sensors mounted on RCM11 current meters in low current regimes (current speeds &gt; 10 cm s-&#xD; 1) .&#xD; All oxygen data sets collected during these deployments showed significant drops of oxygen (of the&#xD; order of 50-100 \\ufffd\\ufffdmol/l) affecting the Optode data stability in low hydrodynamic conditions (fig.1).&#xD; High correlations between all acquired parameters (i.e. temperature, turbidity, speed and direction&#xD; of currents) allowed verifying that no unusual event perturbed the mooring areas during the periods&#xD; of acquisition, although natural events responsible of so abrupt, short and intense oxygen variations&#xD; can\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt be easily found.&#xD; Despite the well-known performance of the Aanderaa Optodes, these experiences suggested that the&#xD; data acquired by optodes installed on RCM11s could not be always reliable, especially in low&#xD; energy systems (typical for the deep ocean) and that current speeds should always be considered in&#xD; order to verify the reliability of the data recorded.&#xD; A series of test in controlled water condition was performed in order to better understand eventual&#xD; sensor dependence on speed current variations and to evaluate sensor stability in quasi-stationary&#xD; water.</description>     <dc:date>2011-09-21T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7310\">     <title>Relative ordering in the radial evolution of solar wind turbulence: the S-Theorem approach</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7310</link>     <description>Title: Relative ordering in the radial evolution of solar wind turbulence: the S-Theorem approach Authors: Consolini, G.; INAF \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Istituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario, 00133 Roma, Italy; De Michelis, P.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: Over the past few decades scientists have shown growing interest in space plasma complexity and in understanding the turbulence in magnetospheric and interplanetary media. At the beginning of the 1980s, Yu. L. Klimontovich introduced a criterion, named S-Theorem, to evaluate the degree of order in far-from-equilibrium open systems, which applied to hydrodynamic turbulence showed that turbulence flows were more organized than laminar ones. Using the&#xD; same theorem we have evaluated the variation of the degree of self-organization in both Alfv\\ufffd\\ufffdenic and non-Alfv\\ufffd\\ufffdenic turbulent&#xD; fluctuations with the radial evolution during a long time interval characterized by a slow solar wind. This analysis seems to show that the radial evolution of turbulent fluctuations is accompanied by a decrease in the degree of order, suggesting that, in the case of slow solar wind, the turbulence&#xD; decays with radial distance.</description>     <dc:date>2011-12-22T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7166\">     <title>An information theory approach to the storm\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsubstorm relationship</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7166</link>     <description>Title: An information theory approach to the storm\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsubstorm relationship Authors: De Michelis, P.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Consolini, G.; Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIstituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario, Rome, Italy; Materassi, M.; Istituto dei Sistemi Complessi, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; Tozzi, R.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: One of the most interesting aspects of the global magnetospheric response to solar&#xD; wind changes is the relationship between storms and substorms. Here we present new&#xD; results on the relationship between these two different classes of magnetospheric&#xD; phenomena by approaching the problem on the side of information theory. Using the&#xD; Auroral Electrojet AL and SYM\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdH indices as representative proxies of magnetic substorms&#xD; and storms, we investigate the transfer of information by means of transfer entropy&#xD; analysis (Schreiber, 2000). The obtained results seem, on average, to indicate the presence&#xD; of a net transfer of information from AL to SYM\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdH on time scales shorter than 10 h. On the&#xD; basis of this result, geomagnetic substorms may act as a driver for the occurrence of&#xD; geomagnetic storms. However, carrying out a more careful analysis which takes into&#xD; account the global geomagnetic daily activity, we suggest that the direction of information&#xD; flow between substorms and storms depends on the global activity level. Indeed, if it is&#xD; true that a sequence of magnetospheric substorms may drive a moderate storm, it is also&#xD; true that very large storms may dominate and drive the occurrence of magnetospheric&#xD; substorms.</description>     <dc:date>2011-08-26T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7165\">     <title>Rank ordering multifractal analysis of the auroral electrojet index</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7165</link>     <description>Title: Rank ordering multifractal analysis of the auroral electrojet index Authors: Consolini, G.; INAF-Istituto di Fisica dello Spazio Interplanetario, 00133 Roma, Italy; De Michelis, P.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: In the second half of the 90s interest grew on&#xD; the complex features of the magnetospheric dynamics in response&#xD; to solar wind changes. An important series of papers&#xD; were published on the occurrence of chaos, turbulence&#xD; and complexity. Among them, particularly interesting was&#xD; the study of the bursty and fractal/multifractal character of&#xD; the high latitude energy release during geomagnetic storms,&#xD; which was evidenced by analyzing the features of the Auroral&#xD; Electrojet (AE) indices. Recently, the multifractal features of&#xD; the small time-scale increments of AE-indices have been criticized&#xD; in favor of a more simple fractal behavior. This is particularly&#xD; true for the scaling features of the probability density&#xD; functions (PDFs) of the AE index increments. Here, after&#xD; a brief review of the nature of the fractal/multifractal features&#xD; of the magnetospheric response to solar wind changes, we investigate&#xD; the multifractal nature of the scaling features of the&#xD; AE index increments PDFs using the Rank Ordering Multifractal&#xD; Analysis (ROMA) technique. The ROMA results&#xD; clearly demonstrate the existence of a hierarchy of scaling&#xD; indices, depending on the increment amplitude, for the data&#xD; collapsing of PDFs relative to increments at different time&#xD; scales.

(1996) and the more recent results by Rypdal and Rypdal&#xD; (2010).</description>     <dc:date>2011-05-05T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
