Etna, located in eastern Sicily, has produced a great&#xD; number of explosive eruptions. Volcanic plumes have risen to several km above sea level&#xD; and created problems for aviation and the communities living near the volcano. A reduction&#xD; of hazards may be accomplished using remote sensing techniques to evaluate important&#xD; features of volcanic plumes. Since 2000, the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer&#xD; (MISR) on board NASA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Terra spacecraft has been extensively used to study aerosol&#xD; dispersal and to extract the three-dimensional structure of plumes coming from&#xD; anthropogenic or natural sources, including volcanoes. In the present work, MISR data&#xD; from several explosive events occurring at Etna are analyzed using a program named&#xD; MINX (MISR INteractive eXplorer). MINX uses stereo matching techniques to evaluate&#xD; the height of the volcanic aerosol with a precision of a few hundred meters, and extracts&#xD; aerosol properties from the MISR Standard products. We analyzed twenty volcanic plumes&#xD; produced during the 2000, 2001, 2002\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd03, 2006 and 2008 Etna eruptions, finding that&#xD; volcanic aerosol dispersal and column height obtained by this analysis is in good&#xD; agreement with ground-based observations. MISR aerosol type retrievals: (1) clearly&#xD; distinguish volcanic plumes that are sulphate and/or water vapor dominated from&#xD; ash-dominated ones; (2) detect even low concentrations of volcanic ash in the atmosphere;&#xD; (3) demonstrate that sulphate and/or water vapor dominated plumes consist of&#xD; smaller-sized particles compared to ash plumes. This work highlights the potential of&#xD; MISR to detect important volcanic plume characteristics that can be used to constrain&#xD; the eruption source parameters in volcanic ash dispersion models. Further, the possibility&#xD; of discriminating sulphate and/or water vapor dominated plumes from ash-dominated&#xD; ones is important to better understand the atmospheric impact of these plumes</description>     <dc:date>2011-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7540\">     <title>Progetto vespa22: Misure presso laboratori Microwave Eurolab</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7540</link>     <description>Title: Progetto vespa22: Misure presso laboratori Microwave Eurolab Authors: Bertagnolio, P.

A lidar was installed in 1990 and has been operational particularly during the winter season. Lidar measurements are used to derive the aerosol backscatter&#xD; ratio between about 10 and 35 km, and the atmospheric temperature (T) profile from 25 up to 70 km, with a resolution of 150 m. A ground-based millimeter-wave spectrometer (GBMS) was installed at Thule in 2001, and has been operational during the winter seasons of 2001-2003 and 2009-2011. The&#xD; GBMS permits to derive the atmospheric concentration profiles of different chemical species, such as O3, CO, N2O, and HNO3, between about 15 and 80 km at a resolution of 6-8 km. The Arctic winter stratosphere is characterized by a high variability, and detection of trends is particularly difficult. The evolution of the vortex and the temperatures in the lower stratosphere has a large impact on formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSC) and on the stratosphere chemical evolution. Coldest winters occurred in 1999-2000, and 2004-2005. Intensive measurement campaigns were conducted at Thule Air Base during winters 2008-2009 and 2010-2011. These two winters have been deeply different in their thermal, dynamical and chemical evolution. The 2008-2009 Arctic winter has been characterized&#xD; by the most intense Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) event ever observed, and the maximum of this warming was detected over Greenland. Thus, ground-based observations of the thermal structure and chemical composition of the middle atmosphere from the station at Thule Air Base have permitted&#xD; to show the evolution of the phenomenon and its interactions with the dynamical structure of the polar vortex in the region of maximum warming. On the contrary, the 2010-2011 has been a very cold winter, and polar stratospheric clouds have been detected by lidar from mid-February to mid-March at Thule Air Base. This very cold winter, together with the massive formation of PSCs, has caused the record stratospheric ozone loss that is occurring in spring 2011 in the Arctic. In this study, we will&#xD; present a summary of the measurements of the thermal and chemical stratospheric structure obtained at Thule Air Base between 1990 and 2011, with special attention to the two winters of 2008-2009 and 2010-2011.</description>     <dc:date>2011-10-23T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7411\">     <title>The development of a new 22 GHz microwave spectrometer for monitoring middle atmospheric water vapour at polar latitudes</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/7411</link>     <description>Title: The development of a new 22 GHz microwave spectrometer for monitoring middle atmospheric water vapour at polar latitudes Authors: Bertagnolio, P.

Accurate observations of stratospheric humidity are needed in the equatorial belt, where water vapour crosses the tropopause, and in the Polar regions, that are affected the most by climate change trends [IPCC, 2007; Solomon et al., 2010].&#xD; Satellite-based observations provide atmospheric composition data with extensive spatial and temporal coverage, but these need to be validated and integrated by ground-based networks like GAW and NDACC Changes in middle atmospheric water vapour on time scales longer than the a satellite mission have been successfully observed by ground-based instruments&#xD; [Nedoluha et al., 2009]. Several ground-based spectrometers have been developed in the last decades to detect the water vapour rotational emission line at 22.235 GHz with heterodyne microwave receivers [e.g., Nedoluha et al., 2009; Straub et al., 2011, Forkman et al., 2003, De Wachter et al., 2011] (see map on the left).

Abstract: The three dimensional reconstruction of volcanic plumes is a central goal to enhance our&#xD; understanding on dispersal processes. In this paper, we use data from the Multi-angle Imaging&#xD; SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on board NASA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Terra spacecraft combined with a stereo matching&#xD; retrieval procedure. We show the potential of MISR in capturing important features of volcanic&#xD; plumes like column height, optical depth, type and shape of the finest particles of two highly&#xD; explosive eruptions occurring on Mt. Etna in 2001 and 2002. This work tests how tephra dispersal&#xD; models reconstruct the 3D shape of volcanic clouds. We compare MISR data with FALL3D, an&#xD; Eulerian model for the transport and deposition of volcanic ash and aerosols coupled with the&#xD; Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale meteorological model. Agreement between&#xD; simulations and MISR data is good regarding both events, although it could be improved by&#xD; increasing the accuracy of the meteorological data, a better constraint on volcanological input&#xD; parameters like the height of the eruptive column and improving our understanding of processes such&#xD; as aggregation phenomena and volcanic cloud microphysics.

L.; Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Institute for Terrestrial and Planetary Atmospheres, State University of New York, Stony Brook, New York, USA Abstract: [1] Muscari et al. [2007] (hereafter referred to as M07) analyzed Arctic winter stratospheric conditions for 2001\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2002 by means of ground-based measurements of stratospheric&#xD; trace gases and temperature from Thule Air Base, Greenland (76.5\\ufffd\\ufffdN, 68.7\\ufffd\\ufffdW). The paper characterized stratospheric air masses observed over Thule from 20 January to&#xD; 5 March 2002. Topics that were discussed included: the passage of both the polar vortex and the Aleutian high over Thule, with significant changes in ozone mixing ratio and&#xD; temperature values; variations of measured O3 total column; vertical descent of air masses observed by means of CO measurements; observations of \"ozone pockets\" [Manney&#xD; et al., 1995]; the correlation between illumination fraction and ozone mixing ratio at 900 K, indicating the relative significance of dynamics and photochemistry on ozone concentration at this altitude; the complete absence of polar stratospheric clouds, as concurrently monitored with a lidar system at Thule; and a qualitative (not quantitative) estimation of local ozone deficiency by means of N2O/O3 correlations.&#xD; M\\ufffd\\ufffdller and Tilmes [2008] (hereafter referred to as MT08) question the significant ozone deficiencies reported by M07 inside the vortex, which, as also pointed out by M07, are difficult to explain by heterogeneous chemistry during the warm winter 2001\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2002. Nonetheless, M07 did speculate that heterogeneous activation of halogen compounds&#xD; during mid-December and early January could have been the origin of the substantial ozone deficiency observed at the end of January/beginning of February in the small&#xD; portion of the vortex core sampled by the Ground-Based Millimeter-Wave Spectrometer (GBMS). MT08 question this claim, as it \"cannot be reconciled with the current&#xD; understanding of halogen driven chemical ozone destruction in the Arctic.\" They suggest flaws in the N2O selection criteria used by M07 in order to identify intravortex N2O/O3 correlations, arising from their contention that GBMS measurements of N2O do not have the necessary spatial resolution needed for the task. MT08 favor instead the use of Potential Vorticity (PV) fields from European Centre Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses.&#xD; [2] As a result of the criticism of MT08, we have looked at N2O/O3 correlations from independent measurements carried out by the Odin Sub-Millimeter Radiometer (Odin/SMR) [Murtagh et al., 2002] and have also reprocessed the GBMS O3 measurements using a different deconvolution technique. The GBMS O3 reanalysis furnishes a significantly&#xD; smaller qualitative estimate of local ozone loss (here and in the following we use \"ozone loss\" specifically to indicate an ozone deficiency due to heterogeneous activation of&#xD; halogen compounds) and is consistent with the Odin/SMR data (section 2). This has resulted in a corrected and enriched version of Figure 9a of M07 (see Figure 2 in section 2).&#xD; Although we value the comments of MT08 which prompted us to reanalyze GBMS ozone data, correcting and improving Figure 9 of M07 and the related discussion, we do reject some of the comments of MT08 concerning the N2O&#xD; selection criteria used by M07, and reiterate the choice of GBMS N2O measurements rather than ECMWF PV values to separate air masses located inside, outside, or at the edge&#xD; of the polar vortex (section 3). Furthermore, we stress that the use of N2O/O3 correlation curves to determine ozone loss inside the vortex, in particular near its edge (a region&#xD; often called \"the outer vortex\"), can indeed cause an overestimation of local ozone loss near the vortex edge region and possibly also an overestimation of the vortex averaged loss (section 4).

Observations of species such as O3, HNO3, CO, N2O, HCN, and HDO took place during 4 winter periods,&#xD; from February 2004 to March 2007, for a total of 116 days of measurements grouped in about 18 field campaigns.&#xD; By studying the pressure-broadened shape of emission lines the vertical distribution of the observed constituents&#xD; is retrieved within an altitude range of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd17-75 km, constrained by the 600 MHz pass band and the 65 kHz&#xD; spectral resolution of the back-end spectrometer. This work discusses the behavior of stratospheric O3 during the&#xD; entire period of operation at Testa Grigia. Mid-latitude O3 columnar content as estimated using GBMS measurements&#xD; can vary by large amounts over a period of very few days, with the largest variations observed in December&#xD; 2005, February 2006, and March 2006, confirming that the northern winter of 2005-2006 was characterized by a&#xD; particularly intense planetary wave activity. The largest rapid variation from maximum to minimum O3 column values&#xD; over Testa Grigia took place in December 2006 and reached a relative value of 72% with respect to the average&#xD; column content for that period. During most GBMS observation times much of the variability is concentrated&#xD; in the column below 20 km, with tropospheric weather systems and advection of tropical tropospheric air into the&#xD; lower stratosphere over Testa Grigia having a large impact on the observed variations in column contents. Nonetheless,&#xD; a wide variability is also found in middle stratospheric GBMS O3 measurements, as expected for mid-latitude&#xD; ozone. We find that O3 mixing ratios at \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd32 km are very well correlated with the solar illumination experienced by&#xD; air masses over the previous \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd15 days, showing that already at 32 km altitude ozone photochemistry dominates over&#xD; transport processes. The correlation of lower stratospheric ozone concentrations with potential vorticity as an indicator&#xD; of transport is instead not as clear-cut, due to very complex mixing processes that characterize stratospheric&#xD; air at mid-latitudes. Correlations of O3 over Testa Grigia with stratospheric tracers such as N2O and HCN, also observed&#xD; by means of the GBMS, are planned for the future, in order to better characterize lower stratospheric dynamics&#xD; and therefore lower stratospheric ozone concentrations at mid-latitudes.</description>     <dc:date>2007-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
