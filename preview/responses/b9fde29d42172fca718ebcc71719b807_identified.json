NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within 0.02 inch of the true position. In this product, the projection line, grids, and orthoimage are believed to meet NMAS. Positional accuracy of the other data layers is less controllable because of diversity of data sources, and may not meet NMAS.</horizpar>       </horizpa>       <vertacc>         <vertaccr>Vertical accuracy report: US Topo contours are derived from the USGS National Elevation Dataset (NED).  Accuracy of the NED is inherited from various sources of digital elevation models used to populate the NED.  These data sources vary in vertical accuracy depending on collection method, control accuracy and density, and local terrain relief.  The overall absolute vertical accuracy of the NED, as tested against HARN control elevations, is 4.78 meters at 95% confidence level (National Standards for Spatial Data Accuracy).  US Topo contours are derived from the NED to generally meet National Map Accuracy Standards (90% of well-defined points in reasonably level terrain test within one-half contour interval of the true ground elevation); however, actual vertical accuracies of individual US Topo quadrangles may not meet that standard.  Quadrangles containing collar notes stating contours \"May not meet National Map Accuracy Standards\" are in areas where the source is known to be questionable for meeting NMAS for the stated contour interval.</vertaccr>       </vertacc>     </posacc>     <lineage>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Jacksonville District, Geomatics Section</origin>             <pubdate>20110101</pubdate>             <title>Orthoimagery - Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands</title>             <geoform>Raster digital data or Digital Orthorectified Image</geoform>             <othercit>The source imagery was obtained from October 2009 through January 2010 and used to produce orthophotos with a 0.3 meter (approximately 1 foot) ground sample distance (GSD). The raw imagery was captured at 12-bit radiometric resolution and converted to 8-bit radiometry during post processing. The imagery was captured with the equivalent of approximately 60% forward overlap between adjacent exposures and 30% sidelap between all adjacent flight lines utilizing a Leica ADS40 digital sensor. The orthographic imagery is available as 4-band (RGBI) GeoTIFF formatted digital images. The projected coordinate system of the source imagery is State Plane Puerto Rico / US Virgin Islands (Zone 5200), NAD 83, GRS 80, Units Meters. The source imagery was then mosaiced, the fourth band was removed, the subsequent image was reprojected to UTM, NAD 83, GRS 80, Unit Meters and resampled to 1 meter GSD . Quarter Quad tiles were extracted with 300 meters over edge to prevent gaps and compressed to JPEG2000 format.</othercit>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>20110101</begdate>               <enddate>20110101</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Imagery</srccitea>         <srccontr>Image</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>TomTom</origin>             <pubdate>2012</pubdate>             <title>Transportation, commercial roads</title>             <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>             <othercit>TomTom Multinet dataset, licensed to the USGS for use in US Topo (1:24,000-scale topographic maps in GeoPDF format - For Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands only , 1:20,000-scale).

CFF data were derived from the standard Forest Service Primary Base Series (PBS) or Single Edition Series (SES) map as part of the Forest Service National Geographic Information System Plan. PBS and SES maps were developed from the U.S. Geological Survey 1:24,000-scale, 7.5-minute topographic map series, with enhancements and regular revisions to satisfy Forest Service needs - For Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands only , 1:20,000-scale. Except in Alaska, where 1:63,360-scale maps are used, the original USGS 1:24,000-scale source maps were constructed to meet National Map Accuracy Standards, which require that 90 percent of all well-defined features shown on the map are within .02 inches of their true location. CFF data were collected using methods and the best technologies available to ensure that digitized elements were captured within .003 inches of corresponding elements shown on source maps. The USDA Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC) uses the same data collection accuracy standard for additions and revisions to the data. Only maps in USDA Forest Service areas will contain USDA Forest roads.</othercit>             <onlink>http://www.fs.fed.us/gstc/</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>2009</begdate>               <enddate>2013</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Roads - USFS FSTopo</srccitea>         <srccontr>Road centerlines, route numbers, road classification, street names</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>Federal Railroad Administration</origin>             <pubdate>2012</pubdate>             <title>Transportation, Railroads</title>             <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>             <othercit>Railroads are based on unpublished data provided to USGS by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).  These data were collected by FRA as part of the Automated Track Inspection Program (ATIP).  Though not originally intended for mapping purposes, the data are judged by USGS to have high positional accuracy and to be suitable for 1:24,000-scale mapping (For Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands only, 1:20,000-scale).  The original data were GPS points, which were thinned, filtered, and consolidated by USGS to create the data shown in US Topo.  These data are not complete, and the levels of actual completeness within a map cell or for the dataset as a whole are not precisely known. ATIP is an ongoing program, FRA has committed to continue working with USGS, and the data will become more complete with each US Topo production cycle.  The USGS has elected to use this mechanism and source of railroad data because no sufficiently current, accurate, and non-proprietary railroad dataset with national coverage can be found.  The names of rail lines will be added at some future date.</othercit>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>2012</begdate>               <enddate>2012</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Railroads - Federal Railroad Administration</srccitea>         <srccontr>Main track centerlines</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>Federal Aviation Administration</origin>             <pubdate>2012</pubdate>             <title>Airports</title>             <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>             <othercit>Runway outlines are for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-recognized public and private airports in the United States.

The high-resolution NHD was originally created using 1:24,000-scale data. State and Local Stewards are improving the data by incorporating local updates based on more current and more accurate source data. Water features in the real world are relatively dynamic and the differences at the time of data collection mean that water features may not register exactly to other layers. The hydrographic feature names contained in and displayed by the NHD are extracted and validated from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). Spatial objects may be filtered or generalized to achieve a 1:24,000-scale representation.  -- For Puerto Rico only, NHD data were originally captured from the 1:20,000 USGS topographic map series.  These data are being continually upgraded by the USGS and partner organizations in Puerto Rico.  Currency, accuracy, and resolution therefore vary.</othercit>             <onlink>http://nhd.usgs.gov/</onlink>             <onlink>http://nhd.usgs.gov/gnis.html</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>20110101</begdate>               <enddate>20110101</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Hydrography</srccitea>         <srccontr>Hydrography features and feature names</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>             <pubdate>2011</pubdate>             <title>Gaging Stations</title>             <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>             <othercit>This dataset, termed \"GAGES II\", an acronym for Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow, version II, provides geospatial data and classifications for 9,322 stream gages maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

With the data frame scale set to 1:5,000 in ArcMap, the center of the Rio Grande/R\\ufffd\\ufffdo Bravo was digitized using the NAIP 2004 Imagery. In areas with dense stands of salt cedar (bounding box = UL -104.714 30.038, UR -104.664 30.037, LR -104.666 29.933, LL -104.717 29.934; NAD83), the center of the channel was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to easily determine. To determine the location of the boundary, the GIS analyst compared the location of the line in the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class with the NAIP 2004 Imagery and adjusted the boundary to the image, thus, the delineation of the international boundary is less certain in these areas. The remaining part of the border was extracted from the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class and appended to the line feature class created along the Rio Grande/R\\ufffd\\ufffdo Bravo. The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed the original USDA data against 2007 NAIP imagery and further edited 9 line segments in the Rio Grande areas to conform to National Map Accuracy Standards.</othercit>             <onlink>http://borderhealth.cr.usgs.gov/projectindex.html</onlink>             <onlink>http://extract.cr.usgs.gov/BorderHealth/Boundaries/Int_Boundary/International_Boundary_Shapefile.zip</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>1972</begdate>               <enddate>2006</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>U.S. / Mexico International Boundary</srccitea>         <srccontr>International Boundary between Mexico and the United States</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service - Washington Office Automated Lands Program (ALP).</origin>             <pubdate>2012</pubdate>             <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>             <title>USDA Forest Service Boundary</title>             <othercit>The forest service boundaries defined by the USDA Forest Service encompassing the National Forest System (NFS) lands within the original proclaimed National Forests, along with lands added to the NFS which have taken on the status of 'reserved from the public domain' under the General Exchange Act.

The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge Boundaries data set depicts the legislative boundary of the 16 National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska at a source scale of 1:63,360. The dataset was created by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Division of Realty and Natural Resources. The USGS substituted the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge boundaries for the USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries in Alaska for cartographic purposes. The USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries are simplified from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Real Estate Interest data layer containing polygons representing tracts of land (parcels) in which the Service has a property or management interest. These interests include full land ownership, secondary interests in property primarily managed and reported by other federal agencies, leased property, property managed by agreement with other parties, and, within National Wildlife Refuges, property governed by conservation easements. A conservation easement is a permanent, legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a landowner and a government agency that restricts real estate, commercial and industrial development of the land, which remains private property. Inholdings of private property within Refuge areas not covered by conservation easements are excluded from these boundaries. The Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Waterfowl production area easements acquired through the small wetlands program have been omitted. Interior boundaries between parcels were dissolved to produce a single set of simplified external boundaries for each feature. These are resource grade mapping representations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service boundaries. For legal descriptions of the land represented here contact the USFWS Realty Office. This map layer was compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuges dataset was derived from the following digital sources and legal documents: 1) Federal Register, Vol. 48, No. 38 Thursday, February 24, 1983 Notices Pages 7890-8029. 2) USGS 1:250,000 scale Alaska Boundary Series maps entitled: Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act December 2, 1980 P.L. 96-487 3) Various legal documents such as survey plats, legal metes and bounds descriptions, Deeds, and Titles. 4) USGS 1:63,360 scale revised hydrography Digital Line Graphs depicting ground conditions from 1955 to 1986. Although these Fish and Wildlife boundaries represent lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, not all areas are open to the public. Some fragile habitats need to be protected from human traffic, some management areas are closed, and the terms of some conservation easements preclude public access. The public is urged to contact specific Refuges or other conservation areas before visiting.</othercit>             <onlink>http://www.fws.gov/GIS/data/CadastralDB/FWS_Simplified_Boundaries.zip</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>63360</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>1950</begdate>               <enddate>2010</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>U.

However, the management of these data is not completely uniform throughout the country; some variations in sources and characteristics are documented in the following sections.   Although this metadata record is included with all maps, PLSS is currently shown on US Topo maps in only a few states.   PLSS will be added to US Topo maps in more states in the coming years. -- For Alaska, PLSS data for US Topo in Alaska consist of protracted (computed, not surveyed) data only. Section boundaries were generated from geodetic latitude and longitude coordinate pairs as recorded on BLM's official protraction diagrams of the state of Alaska. The SDMS_PROD protraction tables were modified to include pro_pt83, section83, and township83. The latitude and longitude values in the pro_pt83 table were transformed from geographic NAD27 coordinates to geographic NAD83 coordinates using NADCON for Alaska. The Informix Section83 table is a spatially-enabled table that contains all of the protraction information for each of the 655,483 sections. Section shapes are stored as NAD83 geographic multipolygons. Each section was individually constructed from NAD83 geographic pro_pt (Protracted Point) table and is fully densified by including all township/section offset corners from adjacent ownship/sections.

US Topo contours are generated from the 1/3 arc-second layer of the National Elevation Dataset (NED).  This NED layer is created using data from a variety of sources including stereoscopically-compiled contours from legacy USGS topographic maps, high-resolution stereo-compilation of mass-points and breaklines, and airborne lidar and ifsar (Alaska only) topographic measurement technologies.  These sources yield varying ranges of vertical accuracy, although the USGS is continually improving the NED accuracy with ifsar and lidar derived elevations. Most US Topo contours in Alaska are derived from ifsar source which is collected to meet NMAS for only contour intervals of 20 feet or greater; however, 10 foot contour intervals are displayed on approximately 40% of Alaska quadrangles in order to provide some reasonable level of terrain detail. Alaska 10-foot interval quadrangles from ifsar contain a statement that they may not meet NMAS for that contour interval. Quadrangles containing collar notes stating contours \"May not meet National Map Accuracy Standards\" are in areas where the source is known to be questionable for meeting NMAS for the stated contour interval. For more specific information on NED source data and accuracy visit ned.usgs.gov.  US Topo contour generation process:  A low-pass filter is applied to the NED 1/3 arc-second data layer to smooth contours primarily in areas of lidar source. Except in areas of lidar source, the NED elevation surface is further modified to conform to flow lines and water bodies from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) in order to improve spatial agreement between the hypsography and updated hydrographic features.  The contour lines are then interpolated from the raster grid and output in the UTM projection. There is no guarantee or warranty concerning the accuracy of the data. Users should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since these data were collected and that some parts of these data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Hydro-feature alignment and generalization also alter the spatial characteristics of the contours. Users should not rely on US Topo contours for high-accuracy applications, but instead, should obtain data of suitable resolution and accuracy from the NED or other sources.</othercit>             <onlink>http://ned.usgs.gov/</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>20100102</begdate>               <enddate>20100102</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Hypsography</srccitea>         <srccontr>Contours</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>             <pubdate>2013</pubdate>             <title>Land Cover - Woodland</title>             <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>             <othercit>The Woodland Tint is a derivative land cover product created using several national map layers: three National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 raster layers (Tree Canopy, Imperviousness, and Land Cover); and two vector layers (National Hydrography Dataset and Transportation). The process begins with masking the NLCD 2001 Canopy Data with NLCD 2001 Imperviousness V1 (values from 1-100), and Land Cover V1 (value 11 = Open Water).  The resulting raster data with canopy values of 20 and greater are converted to woodland vector polygons and smoothed via the Paek Algorithm.  The woodland polygons are masked with buffered Transportation (Roads, Airport Runways, and Railroads) and Hydrography (NHD Areas excluding Inundation Area and NHD Waterbodies excluding Swamp/Marsh).  The resulting polygons are checked for scale appropriate size (minimum size of one acre), and the small woodland polygons as well as small clearings within the woodland polygons are deleted. For Alaska, the Woodland Tint is a derivative land cover product created using five national map layers: one raster layer, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 (Land Cover); and four vector layers (National Hydrography Dataset, Transportation Roads, Transportation Airports and Transportation Railroads). The process begins with combining three NLCD 2001 Land Cover V1 Classes (41 - Deciduous Forest, 42 - Evergreen Forest, and 43 - Mixed Forest). The resulting raster data was converted to woodland vector polygons, and smoothed via the Paek Algorithm. The woodland polygons are masked with buffered Transportation (Roads, Airport Runways, and Railroads) and Hydrography (NHD Areas excluding Inundation Areas and NHD Waterbodies excluding Swamp/Marsh). The resulting polygons are checked for scale appropriate size (minimum size of one acre), and the small woodland polygons as well as small clearings within the woodland polygons are deleted.</othercit>             <onlink>http://nationalmap.gov</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>2001</begdate>               <enddate>2013</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Land Cover - Woodland</srccitea>         <srccontr>National Landcover Dataset; National Hydrography Dataset; National Transportation Dataset</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>             <pubdate>20100102</pubdate>             <title>Shaded Relief</title>             <geoform>raster digital data</geoform>             <othercit>The Shaded relief is a derivative elevation product created from the National Elevation Dataset (NED) 1/3 arc second.  First there are five separate shaded relief datasets created from the original data.  Each shaded relief has different azimuths and altitude values as follows: 00 450, 1350 600, 2700 450, 3150 450, 450 450.  These five datasets are then combined into one feature class using map algebra to compute the raster layers using the following equation shadedrelief1 + shadedrelief2 + shadedrelief3 + (shadedrelief4 x 2) + shaded relief5 \\\\ 6.  This equation gives double importance to the 3150 azimuth and 450 elevation.</othercit>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>20000</srcscale>         <typesrc>digital data</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>20100102</begdate>               <enddate>20100102</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Imagery Shaded Relief</srccitea>         <srccontr>National Elevation Dataset</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin>             <pubdate>2012</pubdate>             <title>Grids and Coordinate System</title>             <othercit>Geographic Coordinate, U.S. National Grid, and UTM grid values are displayed along the map projection.
