The researchers will investigate forensic technologies with the potential to impact crime across Europe and globally.</p> <p>The research projects are all based at the University of Leicester and are co-supervised by academics in a wide range of disciplines including Genetics, Criminology, Chemistry, Psychology, Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Pathology and Immunity, Infection and Inflammation.</p> <p>Dr Lisa Smith, INTREPID Forensics Project Coordinator and senior lecturer in the Department of Criminology, said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences conference and postgraduate symposium was the perfect event for the launch of the INTREPID Forensics project. It provided a great opportunity for the ten PhD researchers on the INTREPID project to network with other postgraduate students and industry experts, as well as raising awareness of the project within the wider forensic community.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Dr Anya Hunt, CEO of the Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences, added: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences were delighted to host their annual Autumn conference and AGM at College Court in Leicester this year. In the 30th anniversary year since the DNA profiling discovery at the University of Leicester, and with the launch if the INTREPID Forensics project, it was an opportunity not to be missed. The Society\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds trace evidence conference and parallel post graduate research symposium, organised in conjunction with Dr. Lisa Smith, were both a huge success. We look forward to seeing the INTREPID project develop and we hope to see the student present their findings at future events.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The conference, held at College Court, focused on the theme of trace evidence and attracted academics and practitioners from across the forensic sciences. There was also a Postgraduate Symposium which featured student research presentations from universities all over the UK and across a wide range of forensic disciplines.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>All of the INTREPID Forensics researchers are writing research blogs about their experiences over the next three years.

causing Icarus to plunge to his death. This story has since permeated Western culture as an allegory\\ufffd\\ufffdwarning against\\ufffd\\ufffdover-ambition.</p> <p>Students Jonathan Cogle, Jake Cox, and Jimmy Pierce from <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science\">The Centre for Interdisciplinary Science </a>have published a new paper looking into the Icarusian myth,\\ufffd\\ufffdspecifically at the likelihood that the wax in\\ufffd\\ufffdhis wings would have melted during his flight - and have found\\ufffd\\ufffdthat it would have taken between about 43 and 70 minutes for the wax to melt, and the distance from the Sun would have played no part in the process.</p> <p>The findings suggest that as long as Icarus\\ufffd\\ufffdstayed within breathable atmosphere and didn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt fly into any significant weather systems, the amount of sun hitting the wings would be almost constant. In the grand scheme of things, changing the distance between Icarus and the Sun\\ufffd\\ufffdwould make\\ufffd\\ufffdno difference - flying 10 meters off the ground or 10,000 would have little effect on the speed in which his wings would melt.</p> <p>In fact, the paper suggests that, if anything, Icarus should have considered flying higher -\\ufffd\\ufffdin the first 10 kilometers above the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds surface, the temperature can decrease from 20 degrees to -60 degrees Celsius. The higher you go, the colder it gets. Therefore, not only could Icarus fly as close to the Sun as he wanted, but he could have flown \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtoo close\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in order to prolong his flight.</p> <p>Perhaps this suggests the old axiom that over-ambition can lead to your downfall should be revised - and that people should instead be encouraged to dream big and aim high.</p> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.physics.le.ac.uk/jist/index.php/JIST/article/view/29\">Read the full paper here </a></li> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/but-not-simpler/2014/04/22/forget-icarus-fly-close-sun-want/#.U1jQlFea96o\">Discover Magazine article on the study</a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Physics and Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Interdisciplinary science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Physics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-04-24T10:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/march/camera-obscurer-how-the-doppler-effect-could-get-you-out-of-a-speeding-ticket\">     <title>Camera obscurer: How the Doppler Effect could get you out of a speeding ticket</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/march/camera-obscurer-how-the-doppler-effect-could-get-you-out-of-a-speeding-ticket</link>     <description>Physics and Astronomy students find it would be possible to become invisible to speed cameras \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd if you could travel at a sixth of the speed of light</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Our physics students are a cunning bunch.
