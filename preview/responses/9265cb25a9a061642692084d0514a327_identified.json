Surveys will employ diving, technical diving, ROV, and hydroacoustics technologies for a comprehensive assessment of the fish and benthic habitat communities of the East and West Bank. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities. During the course of the sanctuary's management plan review process, the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the concept of a research only area was suggested. The purpose of this project will be to provide baseline data for all benthic habitats and communities.</abstract>    <purpose>1) To design an appropriate sampling and monitoring strategies for fish and benthic community sampling, as well as data collection, during the first year funding,  2) during  subsequent years, focus on refinement of the sampling strategies and continuing to build on the baseline dataset, 3) groundtruthing and collection of underwater imagery and video to improve existing map products, 4) the banks begin at 150m depth and reach to within 17m of the water's surface, therefore multiple survey techniques will need to be employed using a random stratified sampling design. An ROV will be utilized to survey the deeper water communities, a combination of divers and technical divers will survey the banks down to ~50m, and ship-based hydroacoustics will be utilized to survey fish densities over the entire depth range; and 5) to analyze the information gathered to help guide sanctuary resource management decisions.</purpose>    <supplinf>This work is being conducted in collaboration with the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS), Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR), NOAA's Center for Coastal Environment and Health and Biomolecular Research (CCEHBR), NOAA's Cooperative Institute for Ocean Exploration, Research and Technology (CIOERT).</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>201005</begdate>      <enddate>Present</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>Ground Condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>as needed</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-93.82</westbc>     <eastbc>-93.59</eastbc>     <northbc>27.92</northbc>     <southbc>27.87</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>Numeric Data Sets > Biology</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE > Biosphere > Zoology > Corals > Reef monitoring and assessment > Reef fish census > Belt transect</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE > Biosphere > Zoology > Corals > Reef monitoring and assessment > Reef fish census > Linear transect</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE > Biosphere > Ecological Dynamics > Species richness</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE > Oceans > Marine Biology > Fish > Fish assemblages</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE > Oceans > Marine Biology > Fish > Fish Census</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>biota</themekey>     <themekey>002</themekey>     <themekey>environment</themekey>     <themekey>007</themekey>     <themekey>oceans</themekey>     <themekey>014</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>coral reef fishes</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt>     <placekey>OCEAN BASIN > Atlantic Ocean > Gulf of Mexico > Flower Garden Banks > East Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0001)</placekey>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY > United States of America > Texas > East Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0001)</placekey>     <placekey>OCEAN BASIN > Atlantic Ocean > Gulf of Mexico > Flower Garden Banks > West Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0002)</placekey>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY > United States of America > Texas > West Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0002)</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>Please reference NOAA/NCCOS/CCMA/Biogeography Branch when utilizing these data in a report or peer reviewed publication.

Sites were randomly selected within strata (East and West Bank, low and high relief coral and depth).</complete>   <lineage>    <procstep>     <procdesc>A stratified random sampling design was employed to sample fish and benthic communities with a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in the sanctuary at depths greater than 150 feet. A sample frame consisting of mutually-exclusive 200m X 200m grid cells was produced and overlaid on the existing benthic habitat map to exhaustively cover all habitats.  Each grid cell was considered a sample unit and units were divided into eight strata.  Strata were defined using benthic habitat, and location (East or West Bank). Benthic habitats include: coralline algal reef, deep reef, algal nodule, and soft bottom.  Data were collected within 100m2 transects.  Transects radiated from the centroid of each sample unit at a random bearing. Once in the field, the boat captain navigated to previously selected sites and the ROV was launched.  The ROV has GPS positioning so it can be deployed on a site and navigate to other sites without having to be brought back aboard the vessel.  Once deployed, high resolution video cameras are continuously running.  Once the station has been reached, the ROV slows to approximately 1 knot and attempts to run along a predetermined heading.  If currents are too strong,the transect is run into the current to maintain stability. If the current is too strong the transect is aborted .  The video is fed into the vessel and scientists take notes about fish and benthic communities as the ROV conducts the transect.  Every 30 seconds the ROV slows and hovers approximately 3 m off the bottom.  A digital still photograph is taken of the bottom, then the transect continues. Fish and benthic analysis are conducted back in the lab upon the completion of the cruise.  Data were collected on the following:  1) Logistic information - date, time of survey, site code, transect bearing, depth.  2) Abundance &amp; size - Fish were identified to the lowest possible taxon possible and the number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length.  If an individual is greater than 35cm, then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded.</procdesc>     <procdate>201009</procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <geograph>     <latres>0.00001</latres>     <longres>0.00001</longres>     <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>    </geograph>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover>We supply abundance and size information of fish species at the lowest possible taxonomic level across all habitats within the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS).
