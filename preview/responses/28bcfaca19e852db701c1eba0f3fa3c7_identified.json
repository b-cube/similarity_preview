In this project, we focused on two main aims. First, the implementation of this technology for direct blood culture identification. Within this aim we determined the limit of detection for the protein purification method we planned on using in our laboratory, determined handling conditions for the samples, and evaluated the MALDI-TOF-MS for concordance with our current workflow and reports. Second, customization of the commercial library for Cryptococcus gattii was performed. Within this aim, we improved representation of the species in the MALDI-TOF-MS library, and also explored ways to determine the subspecies based on gathered spectra.

Among other advantages, the use of DBS specimens facilitate the incorporation of biomarkers into demographic research, especially for large global studies conducted in remote areas with little or no laboratory infrastructure. Here, we report the results of an evaluation of a new method for measuring cystatin C (cysC) in DBS. We adapted a commercial ELISA kit designed to measure cysC in human plasma and were able to measure cysC concentrations across the physiologic range in DBS. Determinations from DBS were linearly correlated and near directly equivalent to cysC concentrations in DBS-matched plasma--intercept=-0.07 (95% confidence interval=-0.17to -0.01) and slope=0.98 (95% confidence interval=0.92 to 1.12), R=0.94. Bland Altman analysis of cysC concentrations in DBS vs. plasma revealed no bias and acceptable levels of agreement (Bias -0.02, 95% confidence interval=-0.21 to 0.17). The DBS-ELISA demonstrates utility as a screening tool; sensitivity and specificity for cysC concentrations outside the upper limit of the reference interval (0.51 mg/L to 1.02 mg/L) were 68% and 95% respectively; however, the DBS-ELISA had difficultly correctly assigning CKD stage from DBS.  We further describe an intra-donor difference in cysC concentration between venous blood collected from venipuncture and capillary blood collected by fingerstick. The DBS-ELISA assay provides an opportunity to explore kidney function in large community-based studies.

Because of their remarkable stability and abundant quantity in blood, circulating microRNAs are promising as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis or prognosis. Platelets are likely to be a substantial contributor to circulating miRNAs. Upon activation, platelets shed membrane-bound microparticles, microvesicles and protein complexes into circulation. Recent studies suggest that circulating miRNAs are protected by encapsulation in vesicles or binding with Argonaute2 (Ago2) protein complex from blood RNase activity. However, the mechanisms of how platelets release miRNAs into circulation, and the role of platelet activation in miRNA release remains unclear. Therefore, I characterized four highly expressed platelet-released microRNAs: miR-16; miR-142-3p; miR-223 and let-7a, using size-exclusion chromatography. My results show that miRNAs are released by platelet activation.  Further, my data suggests that platelet-released miRNAs are primarily associated with vesicle-free protein complexes rather than microparticles and microvesicles.

As aptamers are cost-effective (estimated to be ~1,000-fold cheaper than antibodies) and also temperature-stable, aptamers may be useful in resource-limited settings for T-cell subset quantification. Here, we evaluated the performance characteristics of a CD4 aptamer for T-cell subset quantification. Methods: A CD4-biotinylated-streptavidin-PE aptamer provided by SomaLogic, Boulder, CO was combined with CD3-PC5, CD8-ECD and CD45-FITC antibodies in the multicolor flow cytometric assay; a CD4-A594 antibody was also added as an internal control for the CD4 aptamer. Residual patient samples were evaluated using the aptamer versus antibody reagents. Both the proportion of CD4 T cell and absolute CD4 T cell count were analyzed to evaluate the clinical performance of the aptamer reagent. Results and Conclusion: The CD4 aptamer showed comparable results to the established single platform method, which uses CYTO-STAT reagent (CD45F/CD4RD1/CD8ECD/CD3PC5) and an FC-500 flow cytometry system, with r2 &gt;0.92 of CD4 T-cell% measurement,. Further, both the percentage of CD4 T cells and absolute T-cell count showed excellent agreement over the range of T cell proportions (8.6% to 50%) and absolute T-cell counts (150 cells/ul to 1342 cells/ul) as assessed by the CD4 aptamer as compared to an internal CD4-A594 antibody control, with r2 &gt;0.99 and 9 cells /ul in mean difference. Our results suggest that a CD4 aptamer can perform comparably to an established CD4 antibody for CD4 T-cell subset quantitation and supports further development of aptamers as potential cost-effective reagents in resource-limited regions.
