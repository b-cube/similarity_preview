The remaining attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for accuracy.</attraccr>      </attracc>       <logic>According to TIGER/Line documentation: the feature network of lines (as represented by Record Types 1 and 2) is complete for census purposes. Spatial objects in TIGER/Line belong to the \"Geometry and Topology\" (GT) class of objects in the \"Spatial Data Transfer Standard\" (SDTS) FIPS publication 173 and are topologically valid. Node/geometry and topology (GT)-polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological edit requirements. These requirements include: complete chains must begin and end at nodes, complete chains must connect to each other at nodes, complete chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each complete chain element and are consistent throughout the extract process, and the chains representing the limits of the files are free of gaps. The Census Bureau performed automated tests to ensure logical consistency and limits of files. All polygons are tested for closure. Some polygons in the TIGER/Line files may be so small that the polygon internal point has been manually placed on a node that defines the polygon perimeter. These small polygons have been detected, and corrections will be incorporated in the Census TIGER data in the future. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed Geographic Update System to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census TIGER data base. Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities and places, are used when encoding spatial entities. The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census TIGER data base files. Most of the codes themselves were provided to the Census Bureau by the USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55. Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency.</logic>       <complete>Data completeness reflects the contents of TIGER/Line 1995.</complete>       <posacc>        <horizpa>          <horizpar>DLG accuracy is 120 ft.
