Control, according to Fridland, is evidenced in the way in which skill users are able to marshal a variety of mental and bodily resources in order to keep skill deployment operating fluidly and appropriately. According to Fridland, two prevalent contemporary accounts of skill \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Stanley &amp; Krakauer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (2013) and Hubert Dreyfus\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (2002) \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd fail to account for the features of control, and do so necessarily. While I agree with Fridland that features of control represent desiderata for a satisfactory characterization of the capacity of skills to respond to perturbations, I argue that her account is limited in two ways; first it is applicable only to a particular class of skills I call motor skills, leaving other classes of skills unaccounted for; second, she employs a problematic distinction that rules out the automatic and pre-reflective use of discursive, propositional cues in skill deployment. I put forward a substantive elaboration of Fridland\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds account based on two more general characteristic features of skills I call opportunistic robustness and normative sensitivity. I suggest that these features avoid the difficulties isolated, while preserving the substance of Fridland\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds account of control. This is the accepted manuscript.

Nevertheless, I show that this tension ceases in the case of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcultural homologues\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsuch as specific ideologies, religions, and folk wisdom. I argue that the instances of such special science kinds do have several projectable properties in common due to their shared history of reproduction, and that the social learning involved means we should also expect these kinds to be multiply realized.

We nevertheless identify the psychologically most informed accounts and offer a critical discussion of their hypotheses for the proximate psychological explanations. Based on convergent evidence from several fields of research we argue that there nevertheless is a more plausible alternative proximate account available: the social motivation hypothesis. The hypothesis represents a more basic explanation of the appeal of prosocial behavior, which is in terms of anticipated social rewards. We also argue in favour of our own social motivation hypothesis over Robert Sugden\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds fellow-feeling account (due originally to Adam Smith). We suggest that the social motivation hypothesis not only stands as a proximate account in its own right; it also provides a plausible scaffold for other more sophisticated motivations (e.g. fellow-feelings). We conclude by discussing some possible implications the social motivation hypothesis has on existing modeling practice. This is the accepted manuscript.

However, little attention&#13; has been paid to the shifting uses of forgotten dreams within psychotherapeutic practice&#13; over the course of the twentieth century. This paper argues that post-war psychotherapists in&#13; London, both Jungian and Freudian, developed a range of subtly different approaches to&#13; dealing with their patients\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd forgotten dreams. Theoretical commitments and institutional&#13; cultures shaped the work of practitioners including Donald Winnicott, Melanie Klein, Anna&#13; Freud, and Edward Griffith. By drawing on diaries and case notes, this paper also identifies&#13; the active role played by patients in negotiating the mechanics of therapy, and the&#13; appropriate response to a forgotten dream. This suggests a broader need for a detailed social&#13; history of post-Freudian psychotherapeutic technique, one that recognises the demands of&#13; both patients and practitioners.
