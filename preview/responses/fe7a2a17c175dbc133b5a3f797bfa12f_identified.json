The workshop and field visits were fully sponsored by the Australian-Malaysian Institute (AMI). The three-day event (15 to 17 of May 2012) was jointly organised by ICSU ROAP with the help of the Australian Academy of Science and the Academy of Sciences Malaysia, involved researchers (natural and social sciences) and business and industry representatives from both countries. The event aimed to enhance exchange of knowledge, awareness and interest in green growth strategies in both countries, and increase their ability to jointly engage in activities that promote the greening of the economy \\ufffd\\ufffdin Malaysia and Australia. The green economy is one of the two themes of the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) Rio+20 summit that will be held on 20 - 22 June 2012 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p> <p>The\\ufffd\\ufffd<i>Think Tank</i> provided the opportunity for researchers from both countries to explore possible future collaboration, and to share cutting edge developments in strategic areas relating to green growth. It enabled initial discussions\\ufffd\\ufffdbetween a core group scientists, decision makers, business and industry representatives from Malaysia and Australia on the development of green growth initiatives for both countries. Nine papers were presented, three by Malaysians and six by the Australians. The Malaysian delegation was represented by Dato\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Ghazali Dato\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Mohd Yusoff from Nusatek Industries, Associate Professor Abdul Hadi Harman Shah and Associate Professor Dr. Ahmad Fariz Mohamed both from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.</p> <p>Field visits were organized to facilitate exchange of knowledge on renewable energy and solar cell technologies in Australia and Malaysia. This included visits to companies conducting research and development for dye solar cell technology, and\\ufffd\\ufffdwith photo-voltaic renewable energy technology. A visit was also made to the materials research facilities of New South Wales University where a brief but detailed tour was given of its solar and renewable technology research and sustainable materials research technologies. A tour was made to the TYREE: Energy Technologies Building a new building in the University. It was built based entirely on the need to prioritize the use of renewable energy and materials. Discussions were also held with Sustainable Business Australia (SBA) that links research in universities to business and industry.</p> <p>The workshop and field visits provided good insights on the accomplishments of Australian universities, research institutes, business and industries in developing, promoting and taking the renewable energy and solar energy technologies to the current level of achievement. It pointed to potential future directions for the development of joint research and collaboration between Malaysia and Australia towards promoting a greener economy in Malaysia and elsewhere in Asia and the Pacific.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Sustainable development</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Renewable energy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Energy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Applied science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rio+20</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Research and development</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Social sciences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>National Members</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-05-20T00:23:30Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/icsu-africa/news-centre/news/previous-news-items/30th-icsu-rca-meeting\">     <title>10th ICSU Regional Committee for Africa Meeting</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/icsu-africa/news-centre/news/previous-news-items/30th-icsu-rca-meeting</link>     <description>ICSU Regional Office for Africa will be hosting the 10th ICSU Regional Committee for Africa in Pretoria, South Africa, 24 - 25 March 2011.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Following the appointment of the new\\ufffd\\ufffdICSU Regional Committee for Africa by the ICSU Executive Board after the tenure of previous members expired, ICSU Regional Office for Africa will be hosting the 10th ICSU Regional Committee for Africa.

Montoya on strengthening ties and enhancing collaboration between ICSU ROAP and the NRCP. In conjunction with the visit, a presentation was made to the Governing Board of the NRCP on the future directions of ICSU and potential areas where relations between ICSU ROAP and the NRCP may be strengthened and improved. The NRCP, established in 1933, is the oldest science council in Asia. The Philippines, it should be noted, has been a member of ICSU since the establishment of the NRCP.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The discussion identified common areas of interest including research on hazards and disasters, sustainable energy, and ecosystems. These areas of research had been identified as priority for further development by ICSU ROAP in the next three to six years. Members of the Governing Board expressed keen interest in interacting with ICSU at all levels. Many of the Divisions of the NRCP are aware of the activities of ICSU and have in the past engaged with various ICSU Unions and Interdisciplinary Bodies. Nevertheless it was noted that there are still many areas of collaboration that can be developed further. This includes enhancing the ability of NRCP to efficiently tap the intellectual resources available under ICSU, greater access to data and information, wider engagement of NRCP in capacity building activities organized by ICSU and greater participation in ICSU panels. The Undersecretary for Research and Development of the Department of Science and Technology, Dr Garciano P. Yumul, Jr., that oversees the NRCP, was also present at the meeting.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nor Zaneeda Norman</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Regional Offices</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>National Members</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2008-10-18T22:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/icsu-asia/news-centre/news/archive-2006-2010/icsu-roap-meets-lao-pdr-national-science-council-nsc\">     <title>ICSU ROAP meets Lao PDR National Science Council (NSC)</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/icsu-asia/news-centre/news/archive-2006-2010/icsu-roap-meets-lao-pdr-national-science-council-nsc</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The National Science Council of Lao PDR was established in 2002 to promote the development of scientific research activities in Laos.

This is a major boost for the development of science in Laos and ICSU can have a significant role to play, through its Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific, in enhancing the ability of scientists from Laos to participate in research programmes in the region that will benefit Laos.
