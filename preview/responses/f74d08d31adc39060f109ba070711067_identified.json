The inscription, originally from Lamia in the southern periphery of Thessaly, was first published by Stephanos A. KOUMANOUDIS in the Greek periodical \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 24 October 1864 (No. 541) after a copy made in situ by A. BLASTOS.   Two years later the stone had been brought to the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, and P. EUSTRATIADIS made a revised publication of the text in the same periodical, 22 December 1866 (No. 617), based on an autopsy of the stone.  Because \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd did not have wide circulation, Basilius LATISCHEW (Vasilii LATYSHEV) re-published the inscription in the Mitteilungen des Deutschen arch\\ufffd\\ufffdologischen Instituts No. 7 1882, along with one other Lamian proxeny decree (now IG IX,2 60), made on the basis of his own autopsy of the stone and provided in his publication an apparatus and minimal commentary on the dating of the inscription.   The inscription was last edited in IG IX,2 (1908) by Otto KERN from a squeeze.  For the reason that no substantial commentary on this inscription currently exists, and because some relatively recently proposed restorations seem unlikely based on the examination of the actual stone, I present here a new edition of the text with a brief philological commentary. This is the accepted manuscript. It will be embargoed until 12 months after publication, at which point it will be replaced with the publisher's authorised pdf offprint. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245943\"> <title>Distinguishing between Cypriot scripts: Steps towards establishing a methodology</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245943</link> <description>Distinguishing between Cypriot scripts: Steps towards establishing a methodology Steele, Philippa M.

While archaeology has long been mobilized &#13; within these debates, this paper argues for the unexplored potential of a range of &#13; specialist pockets of qualitative knowledge about specific artefact classes. Terra &#13; sigillata, the red-gloss imperial tableware, is a case in point. By adopting a bird\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds eye &#13; view on sigillata production, distribution, and consumption across a geographical and &#13; chronological range, this paper develops a new metaphor for the role of Roman cities: &#13; as switching devices in the building of networks. By describing the role of cities in &#13; structural rather than categorical terms, this metaphor allows for contingency and for &#13; the integration of different analytical and interpretive scales.

In &#13; particular, ANT studied how scientific facts are constructed and stabilized in &#13; laboratories so that they become universally accepted, seemingly platonic, categories. &#13; This paper returns to this initial insight, and links it to the long-standing issue of &#13; archaeological types. Analysis of the practices of production, consumption, and &#13; distribution of terra sigillata \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Roman archaeology\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds most salient pottery type \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd shows &#13; how it became a category, how it was stabilized as such, and how this process imbued &#13; sigillata with specific agentic properties that allowed it to shape the range of possible &#13; actions in the past. By reframing platonic types as constructed categories, they can &#13; become active elements in our historical narratives. This version is the author accepted manuscript.
