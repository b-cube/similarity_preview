Data were collected from four trial sites in the UK in May 2012. The trial sites comprised of 20 varieties (plots) replicated in three blocks on each farm but only 2 of the blocks at each site were used for pollinator observations. Pollinator observations were also only made where there were greater than 30 percent of OSR plants in flower in the plot and only when weather conditions were within standardised limits. For each plot per site a six minute observation period was made during which the number of pollinators within the following taxon groups were counted: bumblebees to the species level, solitary bees identified to general body forms (Lasiglossum to genus level; Osmia separated to bicolour and rufa; Andrena separated to body forms typical of dorsata, carantonica, nigroaenea, haemorrhoa, fulva, flavipies, nitida, cineraria, bicolour and minuta), large hoverflies (&gt; 12 mm), small hoverflies (&lt; 11 mm), and Bibionidae. Each variety was observed for two separate six minute periods to reduce the impacts of minor fluctuations in weather that may reduce pollinator observations within single six minute periods. The dataset was collected as part of a project which aimed to identify key pollinators for OSR and identify if there are feeding preferences for individual varieties.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pollinators</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bumblebees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>solitary bees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hoverflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bibionidae</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oxfordshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cambridgeshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lincolnshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Suffolk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-05T09:49:53Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/59da8e86-04cc-4f46-a23c-65513d025326\">     <title>Chimney Meadow (Church Field) soil water retention measurements (pF curves)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/59da8e86-04cc-4f46-a23c-65513d025326</link>     <description>Soil moisture and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) measurements within the top metre of soil at Church Field, Chimney Meadow National Nature Reserve. Church Field lies on a clay lens which overlies surrounding sand and gravel soils. Apart from the A and B horizons, the clay was found to be fairly homogenous down to the maximum depth of 1.1m of the access pit.  On the 1:250,000 Soil Map of South East England the location falls into the soils category 832 Kelmscott Association which comprise mostly permeable fine loamy soils over limestone gravel and variably affected by groundwater and with some risk of flooding. However, on the more detailed 1:25,000 scale Sand and Gravel Resources Map of the Thames Valley the clay lens is depicted as Oxford Clay substrate without sand and gravel cover, surrounded by sand and gravel terraces cropping out at the surface.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chimney Meadow</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oxfordshire</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-27T13:15:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
