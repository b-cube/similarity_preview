The DNR Lands data (part of Technology Toolbox Protected Lands data set) consists of mapped information that represent those lands that are owned by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers, establish wetlands, protect highly erodible land, and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use. The information contained in Spatial Data is from publicly available sources, but no representation is made as to the accuracy or completeness of Spatial Data.

The Department of Natural Resources shall not be liable for any lost profits, consequential damages, or claims against the Department of Natural Resources by third parties. The liability of the Department of Natural Resources for damage regardless of the form of the action shall not exceed any distribution fees that may have been paid in obtaining Spatial Data.</abstract>    <purpose>These files were created for the planning purposes of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. However, not all DNR owned lands have been surveyed and mapped at this time. Therefore, data should not be used as a definitive source of land ownership.</purpose>   </descript>     <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>2010</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>The publication date</current>   </timeperd>     <status>    <progress>In work</progress>    <update>Annually</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-79.48715210</westbc>     <eastbc>-75.04589844</eastbc>     <northbc>39.72401428</northbc>     <southbc>37.91142273</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>Ramona GIS Inventory</themekt>     <themekey>planningCadastre</themekey>        </theme>    <place>                 <placekt>None</placekt>                 <placekey>Maryland</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>The Spatial Data, and the information therein, (collectively the &quot;Data&quot;) is provided &quot;as is&quot; without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory.
