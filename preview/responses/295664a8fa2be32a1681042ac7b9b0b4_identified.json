This is a speech attributed to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>&#8217;s authorship, written for a man named <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name>, who was suing his half-brother <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name>. This is the second time <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> sued <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name> (see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 39\" n=\"Dem. 39\">Dem. 39</bibl>). The plaintiff was the legitimate son of <name type=\"person\">Mantias</name>, who had two other, illegitimate sons, the older one of whom was <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name>, the defendant. After <name type=\"person\">Mantias</name> died, all three sons agreed to divide their father&#8217;s property three ways. But a dispute arose regarding their mothers' money: the defendant claimed that his mother had brought one talent (see <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>) into the marriage, which he did not want to share with his half-brothers. The half-brothers claimed that their mother had given <name type=\"person\">Mantias</name> (the father) 100 minae (see <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>), which they did not want to share with <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name>. In the speech, <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> says that the case had been in arbitration for eleven years before coming to trial, and he further claims that the half-brothers might try to poison him. Based on the style of this speech, it is generally thought that this speech is not actually by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> (source: <bibl>A.T. Murray, <title>Demosthenes IV</title> [Cambridge, Loeb: 1936] 481</bibl>). The speech was written sometime after <date value=\"-348\">348 BCE</date>, which is the date for the first suit between this plaintiff and defendant (see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 39\" n=\"Dem. 39\">Dem. 39</bibl>) (Source for date: <bibl>R. Sealey, <title>Demosthenes and his Time: a study in defeat</title> [Oxford, 1993] 144</bibl>) </p> <byline>Christopher Blackwell</byline> </div0>   </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
