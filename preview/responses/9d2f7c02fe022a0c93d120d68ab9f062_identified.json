The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey in each of those years, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as the estimated mean length of linear features (hedgerows, walls, fences, banks, grass strips and tree lines) per 1km square within 45 different Land Class types based on the ITE Land Classification.  The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedgerows</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-10T14:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5ff7f210-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (1km percentage target class, GB) Web Map Service v1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5ff7f210-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>This view shows a 1km resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Great Britain.

The series of LCM2007 products includes vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LCM2007</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-07-23T12:28:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/48cd6732-bbfb-466d-ba80-ecc9e591a5c0\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (1km dominant aggregate class, N.Ireland) v1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/48cd6732-bbfb-466d-ba80-ecc9e591a5c0</link>     <description>This dataset consists of a 1km resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Northern Ireland.  Each 1km pixel represents the dominant aggregate class across the 1km area.  The aggregate classes are aggregations of the target classes, broadly representing Broad Habitats (see below).  The dataset is part of a series of data products produced by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology known as LCM2007.  LCM2007 is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom. The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors and also incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets.
