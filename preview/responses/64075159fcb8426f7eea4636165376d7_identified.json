The purpose was to collect data for regional survey of the UK continental Shelf. See Survey 1973/7 for the second phase of the project. A total of 6395km over 91 survey lines were collected during 1973/6 (Lines 1-49) and 1973/7 (Lines 50-91) surveys. Sea floor data were collected using echo sounder and transit sonar. Sub-bottom profiling data were collected using gravity meter; magnetometer; pinger and sparker. The data were recorded as paper records. These data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS report WB/MG/74/48.</dc:description>    <dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">1973-06-06</dc:date> </oai_dc:dc>",
