A third pilot project also on air pollution and urban health is being developed for Xiamen city in China. Dr Franz Gatzweiler, Executive Director of the newly established ICSU International Programme Office (IPO) on Urban Health and Well-Being based at the Institute for Urban Environment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Xiamen, also attended the meeting. The Committee will continue to assist the pilot project teams to secure funding for their research by working together with the IPO. It will also continue strengthening the knowledge base and building capacities in the interdisciplinary and integrated systems approach to research on health and wellbeing. The meeting was hosted by the UNU International Institute for Global Health. </span></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-09T06:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/icsu-asia/news-centre/news/2nd-simsea-japan-workshop\">     <title>2nd SIMSEA Japan Workshop</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/icsu-asia/news-centre/news/2nd-simsea-japan-workshop</link>     <description>Center for International Collaboration, AORI of the University of Tokyo and Application Lab of JAMSTEC will host 2nd SIMSEA Japan workshop on 9 March 2015</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This 2nd SISMEA Japan workshop will be held at the University of Tokyo 9 March 2015.
