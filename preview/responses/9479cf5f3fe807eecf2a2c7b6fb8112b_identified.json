In his presentation, Jack Portman, FAIA, Vice Chairman of John Portman &amp; Associates, will share his perspective and knowledge gained from over three decades spent navigating the demanding practice of architecture in China. He will talk about the early days (beginning in 1979) as the first American working as both an architect and developer in China, and share lessons learned on seminal projects such as Shanghai Centre (China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds first major mixed-use project, 1990) and Beijing Yintai Centre (2008), as well as more recent projects such as the Waldorf Astoria Shanghai on the Bund (2011) and ongoing work spanning into China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds secondary and tertiary cities. Presented on February 13, 2015 at 12:00 p.m. in room 258 of the School of Architecture.; Jack Portman began his career in 1973 as an architect for John Portman &amp; Associates in Atlanta. He later expanded his responsibilities from the design field to a position of corporate leadership. Recognizing the tremendous potential in Asia, he established the first Portman international office in Hong Kong in 1979. In 1980, he helped pioneer Portman Holdings\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd entry into China and laid the groundwork for the design and development of Shanghai Centre, at which time Portman Holdings became one of the first western development companies to develop real estate in China. In 1993, he established an office in Shanghai. In 1998 Jack returned to Atlanta to provide leadership for Portman Holdings and John Portman &amp; Associates. He later established Portman offices in India and South Korea. Jack, a licensed architect, holds a B.S. degree in architecture from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Master\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds degree in architecture from the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University.; Runtime:  56:45 minutes </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Portman, Jack</dc:creator> <dc:description>Many U.S. firms are looking to expand their business by venturing overseas.

Snow, Julie In recent years, design practice has undergone a radical expansion in scope, and therefore, in possibilities. Expectations for design performance are no longer confined to a powerful aesthetic experience or a single efficient functional operation. Today architecture is expected to work with a layered context of cultural, economic, historic, social, ecological and political systems.  Architecture projects are no longer independent self-sufficient entities but as elements performing within a complex system of variables. It is within these complex systems that we measure the performance of our design strategies.  Understanding the position of a particular site with in ecological systems requires modeling the resources consumption, while understanding local social and cultural context can influence how a design is used and perceived.  Economic consequences on the cost side, are not limited to construction costs, but also forecast operational cost models, energy consumption, and staffing requirements.  Further public projects are expected to contribute to economic development as well as the quality of civic life. Resolving these complex structural relationships demands cohesive integration of variables based on thorough research, a breadth of team expertise and a balanced approach to design objectives.&#13; &#13; Our studio work investigates architecture\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds capacity to transform experience. Using restraint and minimal means, we pursue the inspired moments architecture can bring to everyday use. Our design process begins with thorough research to support both the pragmatic and the intangible aspirations of our clients, leading to architecture that presents our clients\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ethos and mission.  Our work has always performed within a demanding economic context, working within stated cost parameters but also creating new economic possibilities.  Grounded within the specifics of each site's historic, urban, cultural and landscape context, architecture has a unique power to intensify our connection to a place.  Through creative collaboration with our engineering and construction teams, we provide integrated building systems that achieve greater effectiveness, efficiency and durability. Synergies are achieved among building systems that advance our architecture\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds sustainable performance as well as addressing creative systems that reduce energy consumption. Presented on February 4, 2015 at 6:00 p.m. in the School of Architecture Reinsch-Pierce Auditorium.; A graduate of the University of Colorado, Julie Snow, FAIA, lived and worked abroad for several years before establishing a practice in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Snow founded Julie Snow Architects in 1995 and now leads, along with Matt Kreilich, AIA, the studio-based practice, Snow Kreilich Architects. The studio\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds diverse scale and type of work is joined by a common exploration of material and detail. Its interest in pragmatic and critical programmatic reflection results in innovative designs that expand the understanding of architectural performance.; Runtime:  73:53 minutes </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-04T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Snow, Julie</dc:creator> <dc:description>In recent years, design practice has undergone a radical expansion in scope, and therefore, in possibilities.
