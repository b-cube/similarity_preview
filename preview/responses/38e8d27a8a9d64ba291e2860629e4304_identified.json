For the project, information has been collated about traditional trade routes and patterns of shipping movements; modern and historic approaches to ports and harbours; incidents of contemporaneous large scale shipping losses such as sea battles; navigational hazards; and historic shipping losses where physical remains have been identified on the seabed. The digital archive consists of a Source Appraisal, Year 1 and Year 2 Reports and an additional Mapping report.</dc:description>    <dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2007-04-07</dc:date> </oai_dc:dc>",
