With this proliferation of Holocaust organizations, came an important question: How should the Holocaust be represented on the walls and galleries of such organizations? There was a large body of research about Holocaust history and education, as well as Holocaust atrocity photography, Holocaust representation, and the role of imagery in collective memory. However, there appeared to be little consensus about the issue of Holocaust representation in museums, and in particular, the use of graphic or violent Holocaust atrocity images. This qualitative study examined the practices and opinions toward the exhibition of Holocaust atrocity images by professionals who worked in Holocaust institutions in the U.S. and Canada. The study found that professionals working in the field largely believed that the use of Holocaust atrocity images was important to the teaching of the Holocaust. However, the research also showed that there were big concerns about who would see these images, how often, and the effects Holocaust atrocity images had on visitors. This study provided important factors for exhibit designers and developers to consider when deciding to exhibit or not exhibit Holocaust atrocity images.

Johnson Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Kristine Morrissey, Ph.D. Museology Negative attitudes toward math, characterized in part by dislike of, disinterest in, and low self-confidence in math, are so pervasive in the United States as to have become socially acceptable.  Some science centers, as institutions dedicated to inspiring interest in STEM fields, have incorporated more opportunities for visitors to engage with math, but such exhibits and programs have been designed mainly for children and family groups.  This mixed methods study examines the math-related attitudes and interests of participants in a popular form of science center-sponsored program for adults, the science caf\\ufffd\\ufffd.  Findings suggest that science caf\\ufffd\\ufffd audiences may be receptive to the introduction of increased math content and math-related topics into the program format.  Most participants indicated moderate to high self-confidence in math and high value of participating in math-based learning activities, particularly as a benefit to brain health.  Moreover, the majority of participants indicated significant interest in hearing about applied mathematics topics in science caf\\ufffd\\ufffds, with greatest interest in math as it relates to the arts.  Participants preferred math-related topics that are relevant, unexpected and personally valuable, as well as those that provide a unique learning opportunity and are within their perceived level of math ability.  These findings may be useful to science caf\\ufffd\\ufffd organizers and science center professionals looking to incorporate more math-based content into their programs in a way that is enjoyable, relevant and interesting for adult audiences.

Arts integration appears in science center practice as well to achieve STEM learning. A wide range of efforts of arts integration with STEM subjects exists across science centers, however research in this area is nascent. This qualitative study examined the practices of three science centers integrating the arts in varying capacities to determine trends in the purpose, strategies, assessment, and challenges of arts integration at science centers. Findings suggest that the purpose of arts integration is to benefit science center visitors in multiple ways. These science centers collaborate with artists and external professionals to inform arts integration projects in different ways. The challenges of arts integration at these institutions include working with professionals from different backgrounds and making a case for funding. Finally, there seems to be no assessment strategies specific to measuring the success of arts integration at these sites. This research articulates recommendations to advance arts integration at science centers for both practitioners and researchers.

Literature suggests a trend of museum marketing departments becoming increasingly involved in the exhibition development process. For-profit internal marketing strategies provide strategic comparison to the best practices and benefits attributed to the increased involvement of the marketing department during the exhibition development process. The Museum of History &amp; Industry, Pacific Science Center, Henry Art Gallery, and Museum of Flight serve as case studies for the role of museum marketing departments during the exhibition development process. Interviews with museum marketing professionals at each institution shed light on how marketing is involved with the exhibition development process, the best practices of that role, steps to achieve the best practices, and the benefits of achieving the best practices stated. Analysis and discussion reveal increased marketing involvement during the exhibition development process. Emerging trends include; involvement of the marketing department from concept to launch, recognition of benefits to good communication throughout the exhibit development process, and an alignment of the interviewed museums' best practices of marketing departments during the exhibit development process.
