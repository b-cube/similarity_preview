We &#xD; found evidence that sea-ice treatment plays a crucial role &#xD; on simulating the ACW. In particular, SST anomalies at &#xD; interannual time scales describe a propagating ACW-like &#xD; pattern when a dynamic thermodynamic sea-ice model &#xD; is coupled with the ocean, but when sea-ice is relaxed &#xD; to climatology, anomalies occur as zonally symmetric &#xD; patterns that do not propagate in longitude. Moreover, &#xD; from the experiment with an active sea-ice component &#xD; we saw that ACW-like oscillations are strongly modulated &#xD; by low frequency variability. Our result adds some &#xD; extra confidence to previous studies based on relatively &#xD; short series of observed data.</description>     <dc:date>2004-05-28T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8813\">     <title>Monitoraggio sismico del territorio nazionale: stato dell'arte e sviluppo delle reti di monitoraggio sismico</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8813</link>     <description>Title: Monitoraggio sismico del territorio nazionale: stato dell'arte e sviluppo delle reti di monitoraggio sismico Authors: Sergio, Guardato; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione OV, Napoli, Italia Abstract: Il sistema CUMAS (Cabled Underwater Module&#xD; for Acquisition of Seismological data) \\ufffd\\ufffd un&#xD; prodotto tecnologico-scientifico complesso nato&#xD; con il Progetto V4 [Iannaccone et al., 2008] allo&#xD; scopo di monitorare l\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdarea vulcanica dei Campi&#xD; Flegrei (fenomeno del bradisismo).&#xD; Si tratta di un modulo sottomarino cablato e&#xD; connesso a una boa galleggiante (meda elastica).

Vittorino plain (Rieti, Central Italy), where evidences of past and present hydrothermal activity exists. In winter (February 2011) lake Paterno waters were almost completely mixed, whereas in summer time (July 2011) thermal and chemical stratifications established. During the stratification period, water and dissolved gas chemistry along the vertical water column were mainly controlled by biological processes, such as methanogenesis, sulfate-reduction, calcite precipitation, denitrification, and NH4 and H2 production. Reducing conditions at the interface between the bottom sediments and the anoxic waters are responsible for the relatively high concentrations of dissolved iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn), likely present in their reduced oxidation state. Minerogenic and biogenic products were recognized at the lake bottom even during the winter sampling. At relatively shallow depth the distribution of CH4 and CO2 was controlled by methanotrophic bacteria and photosynthesis, respectively. The carbon isotope signature of CO2 indicates a significant contribution of deep-originated inorganic CO2 that is related to the hydrothermal system feeding the CO2-rich mineralized springs discharging in the surrounding areas of lake Paterno. The seasonal lake stratification likely controls the vertical and horizontal distribution of fish populations in the different periods of the year.</description>     <dc:date>2011-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8168\">     <title>Process studies on the ecological coupling between sea ice algae and phytoplankton</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8168</link>     <description>Title: Process studies on the ecological coupling between sea ice algae and phytoplankton Authors: Tedesco, L.; Marine Research Centre, Finnish Environment Institute; Vichi, M.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Bologna, Bologna, Italia; Thomas, D.; Marine Research Centre, Finnish Environment Institute Abstract: The seasonal dynamics of pelagic and sea ice communities are closely related in ice-covered waters, however, modelling works that analyse such interactions are scarce. We use the Biogeochemical Flux Model in Sea Ice (BFM-SI) coupled to the pelagic Biogeochemical Flux Model (BFM) in a study area in Greenland to quantitatively investigate: (1) the significance of photoacclimation/photoadaptation strategies of autotrophs, (2) the fate of the sea ice biomass in case of algae seeding, algae aggregation and at different mixed layer depths and (3) the changes in community production under a climate change scenario. The results show that sea ice algae need to be both photoacclimated and photoadapted to the sea ice environment in order to grow, while phytoplankton may adopt different strategies for optimising their growth. The seeding of the phytoplankton bloom shows to be driven, both in timing and magnitude, by the viability of sea ice algae and by the degree of aggregation of algae released from the ice, which also affects the sinking rate to the sea floor. Under a mild climate change scenario (SRES B2, 2071\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2090) the sea ice community is projected to be generally more productive, whereas phytoplankton growth will be reduced because the melt of sea ice will occur earlier in the season when light is less favourable to sustain the growth. While it is generally anticipated that the melting of multi-year ice in the Arctic Ocean will cause an increase in marine production, this study shows that seasonal ice-covered seas in the Northern hemisphere may actually be less productive and may shift to more oligotrophic conditions within the next 100 years.</description>     <dc:date>2011-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8029\">     <title>Low pressure experiments in piston cylinder apparatus: calibration of newly designed 25 mm furnace assemblies to P = 150 MPa</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8029</link>     <description>Title: Low pressure experiments in piston cylinder apparatus: calibration of newly designed 25 mm furnace assemblies to P = 150 MPa Authors: Masotta, M.; Sapienza Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd Roma; Freda, C.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma1, Roma, Italia; Paul, T.

Two newly designed 25 mm furnace assembly have&#xD; been developed and calibrated using two differe nt calibration methods: the NaC l melting curve and the sol-ubility of H2 O in albitic and rhyolitic melts.

Moreover, because these experiments are performed at temperatures higher than&#xD; those used for NaCl calibration, they demonstrate that the pressure correction is not affected by temperature&#xD; in the range 800\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 1000 \\ufffd\\ufffdC. The accuracy of the pressure estimate associated wi th the calibration methods is \\ufffd\\ufffd&#xD; 25 MPa.&#xD; The major advantage of using the new assemblies is that low pressure experiments, which require rapid&#xD; heating and quenching rates (e.g. volcanic and hydrothermal systems), can be performed with the same&#xD; ease and precision as standard high pressure experiments for which piston cylinder is routinel y used.</description>     <dc:date>2011-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/5744\">     <title>Modelling approach to the assessment of biogenic fluxes at a selected Ross Sea site, Antarctica</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/5744</link>     <description>Title: Modelling approach to the assessment of biogenic fluxes at a selected Ross Sea site, Antarctica Authors: Vichi, M.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Bologna, Bologna, Italia; Coluccelli, A.; UniPoliMa; Ravaioli, F.; CNR-ISMAR; Giglio, F.; CNR-ISMAR; Langone, L.; CNR-ISMAR; Azzaro, M.; CNR-IAMC; Azzaro, F.; CNR-IAMC; La Ferla, R.; CNR-IAMC; Catalano, G.; CNR-ISMAR; Cozzi, S.; CNR-ISMAR Abstract: Several biogeochemical data have been collected in the last 10 years of Italian activity in Antarctica (ABIOCLEAR, ROSSMIZE, BIOSESO-I/II). A comprehensive 1-D biogeochemical model was implemented as a tool to link observations with processes and to investigate the mechanisms that regulate the flux of biogenic material through the water column. The model is ideally located at station B (175\\ufffd\\ufffd E\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd74\\ufffd\\ufffd S) and was set up to reproduce the seasonal cycle of phytoplankton and organic matter fluxes as forced by the dominant water column physics over the period 1990\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2001. Austral spring-summer bloom conditions are assessed by comparing simulated nutrient drawdown, primary production rates, bacterial respiration and biomass with the available observations. The simulated biogenic fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and silica have been compared with the fluxes derived from sediment traps data. The model reproduces the observed magnitude of the biogenic fluxes, especially those found in the bottom sediment trap, but the peaks are markedly delayed in time. Sensitivity experiments have shown that the characterization of detritus, the choice of the sinking velocity and the degradation rates are crucial for the timing and magnitude of the vertical fluxes. An increase of velocity leads to a shift towards observation but also to an overestimation of the deposition flux which can be counteracted by higher bacterial remineralization rates. Model results suggest that the timing of the observed fluxes depends first and foremost on the timing of surface production and on a combination of size-distribution and quality of the autochtonous biogenic material. It is hypothesized that the bottom sediment trap collects material originated from the rapid sinking of freshly-produced particles and also from the previous year's production period.</description>     <dc:date>2008-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/5743\">     <title>An enhanced sea-ice thermodynamic model applied to the Baltic sea</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/5743</link>     <description>Title: An enhanced sea-ice thermodynamic model applied to the Baltic sea Authors: Tedesco, L.; CMCC; Vichi, M.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Bologna, Bologna, Italia; Haapala, J.; Finnish Institute of Marine Research; Stipa, T.; Finnish Institute of Marine Research Abstract: A refined Semtner 0-layer sea-ice model (ESIM1) is presented and applied to the Baltic landfast sea-ice.

In order to characterize the historical behaviour (last 400 yr) of Dome C and Talos Dome (East Antarctica), ice velocities have been measured since 1996 using a GPS system, and the palaeo-spatial variability of snow accumulation has been surveyed using snow radar and firn cores. The snow accumulation distribution of both domes indicates distributions of accumulation that are non-symmetrical in relation to dome morphology. Changes in spatial distributions have been observed over the last few centuries, with a decrease in snow accumulation gradient along the wind direction at Talos Dome and a counter-clockwise rotation of accumulation distribution in the northern part of Dome C. Observations at Dome C reveal a significant increase in accumulation since the 1950s, which could correlate to altered snow accumulation patterns due to changes in snowfall trajectory. Snow accumulation mechanisms are different at the two domes: a wind-driven snow accumulation process operates at Talos Dome, whereas snowfall trajectory direction is the main factor at Dome C. Repeated GPS measurements made at Talos Dome have highlighted changes in ice velocity, with a deceleration in the NE portion, acceleration in the SW portion and migration of dome summit, which are apparently correlated with changes in accumulation distribution. The observed behaviour in accumulation and velocity indicates that even the most remote areas of East Antarctica have changed from a decadal to secular scale.</description>     <dc:date>2008-01-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/3573\">     <title>On the shape of reflecting surfaces investigated by a 60 MHz radar</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/3573</link>     <description>Title: On the shape of reflecting surfaces investigated by a 60 MHz radar Authors: Bianchi, C.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Sciacca, U.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma1, Roma, Italia; Tabacco, I.

The length of the radio wave carrier does not allow the&#xD; employment of sophisticated antennas, so folded dipoles are used, arranged beneath the wings. As a consequence, the transmitted radio wave beam illuminates a relatively large area, making the power of the echo signal related in a significant way to the shape of the reflecting surfaces. An electromagnetic analysis shows that the amplitude variations detected by the system, under certain conditions, are mainly due to focusing or defocusing effects determined by the shape of the reflectors.</description>     <dc:date>2002-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
