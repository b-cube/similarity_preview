Boundary lines that follow PLSS lines were derived from USGS GCDB data dated October 2010. Subdivision tracts in Larimer County were taken from Larimer County GIS data. Tract 04-166, 04-168, and 04-169 were cogo'ed from survey map romo_survey_1973_1 dated 1/30/1973. Tract 02-162 was cogo'ed from deed 167 and survey map romo_sunnyridge_1 dated May 26, 1922. Tracts 10-103, 10-106C, 10-102, and 10-112 were cogo'ed from survey map romo2003410_1 dated 12/28/2005. Tract 02-101 was cogo'ed from survey map romo2003410_2 dated 12/26/2005. Tract 02-121 in section 27 T5N R73W was drawn by offsetting the centerline of High Line Road as provided by the Rocky Mountain National Park GIS staff by 30 feet on either side as per deed romo21F. Tracts 03-102, 03-103, 03-104, 03-112, 03-114, 03-115, 03-116, 03-117, 03-118, 03-119, 03-120, 03-121 (Summerland Subdivision) was drawn by geo-referencing and on-screen digitizing Grand County Tax map 1075-33-4 (document archives title: romo1075-33-4). Tract 10-101, 10-104, and 10-105 were cogo'ed from deed romo342 and survey map romo203410_3 dated 12/28/2005. Tracts 05-124 and 05-102 were cogo'ed from survey map romo_3069a dated 9/1/1995. Tracts 05-122, 05-131 and 05-113 were cogo'ed from deed romo352 which includes a survey map of the area. The southern boundary of tract 05-122 follows the southern right-of-way line of highway 7. This right of way was drawn by offsetting the Rocky Mountain National Park GIS roads dataset by 33 feet as per survey map romo_3069a. Tract 05-114 was cogo'ed from deed 330. The 20' right-of-way was drawn by onscreen digitizing the roadway from 2009 NAIP imagery and offsetting 10 feet on either side. Tract 10-110 was cogo'ed from survey map romo_3648 dated 4/23/2001. Tract 07-144 was cogo'ed from survey map romo_b002 dated 3/15/1985. Tracts 07-101, 07-110, 07-111, 07-112, 07-113, 07-114, 04-155, 04-156, 04-157, 04-160, 04-161, 04-162, 04-164, 04-179, 04-180 were cogo'ed from survey map romo_b010. Tracts in segment map 08 (woodland heights subdivision) were cogo'ed from their respective deeds. The bearing and distance calls for these tracts were based on USGS GLO Plats which listed the N1/2 of the section line between sections 34 and 35 as N04d34'E. The current N1/2 of the section line between tract 34 and 35 bears N04d26\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdW\". To correct for this discrepancy, the tracts were rotated 0d07'.41\" around point x=2985461.22, y=1375856.12 (NW corner of section 35 T5N R73W). Tracts in segment map 08 that are described as having a north boundary that follows the southern right of way of the High Line Road were drawn by offsetting the roadway provided by the Rocky Mountain National Park GIS staff by 30 feet on either side as per deed romo21F which describes tract 02-121 as a 60 foot tract of land, 30 feet on either side of the centerline of the roadway. Tract 06-105 was previously drawn by Rocky Mountain Park GIS personnel. This previously drawn linework was utilized due to the unavailability of an adequate legal description, and the NPS owns these tracts and all of the land surrounding these tracts in Fee. Tracts 01-110, 01-112, 01-114, 01-117, 01-120, and 01-125 were drawn by on screen digitizing the centerline of highway 34 (Trail Ridge Road) and offsetting 50 feet on either side to produce a 100 foot right-of-way. Tract 09-172/09-177 was drawn by onscreen digitization from segment map 09 dated December 22, 1980. The southeast boundary for tract 10-106 follows the north right-of-way line of Devil\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Gulch Road. This right-of-way was drawn by offsetting the Rocky Mountain National Park GIS roads dataset by 33 feet to the north. Unless otherwise stated, all tract linework that represents river or creek centerlines were taken from a GIS dataset provided by Rocky Mountain National Park GIS which were derived and developed from 1:24,000 USGS Digital Line Graph (DLG) data, 1:24,000 USFS Cartographic Feature File (CFF) data, Global Positioning System (GPS) data, and on-screen digitization by Park personnel from USGS DOQs and color DOQs developed for Rocky Mountain National Park. Unless otherwise states, all tract linework that represents roadway right of ways were taken from a GIS dataset provided by Rocky Mountain National Park GIS which were derived and developed from 1:100,000 USGS DLG transportation data, 1:50,000 USGS map of Rocky Mountain National Park (40105-A4-PF-050), GPS data, and on-screen digitization by Park personnel from digital photoorthoquad data. Right of ways were then created by offsetting the centerline on either side by the distance as described in the appropriate deed for each tract. Tract 06-126 was cogo'ed from BLM survey map romo_T5NR76W. The park boundary follows the northern right-of-way of Grand Gulch and the Grand Gulch access road. The right-of-way for the Grand Gulch access road was drawn by offsetting the centerline by 30'. The shared line between tracts 02-110 and 02-108 was drawn as the north right-of-way line of highway 34. No deed is available for these tracts. They appear to share a boundary line with tract 02-127 on previous segment maps which, per deed 297 has a southern boundary that follows the northern right-of-way of highway 34. The SW corner of tract 03-122, NW corner of tract 03-125, NW corner of tract 03-129, tract 05-121, tract 07-127, and tract 05-114 were adjusted based on correcetd GPS points collected by park GIS personnel. NAD83 Colorado State Planes, North Zone, US Foot was used as the source coordinate system for the Autodesk Land Desktop project. The Autodesk line work is imported, edited, attributed, approved, and a link and node topology is developed both for the tract and boundary data layers according to the procedures described in the Land Acquisition Procedures Manual Chapter 5. The entire unit is created in a geographically contiguous model space and separate layouts representing each individual segment map are created. The tract and boundary data is then reprojected to North American Datum 1983 generic latitude &amp; longitude and exported from Autodesk to an ArcView shape file format in a single step.</procdesc>         <srcused>Deeds, Segment Maps, and Survey Maps from the NPS LandsNet Archive (http://landsnet.nps.gov/tractsnet/documents/romo/) </srcused>         <srcused>2010 NAIP high resolution ortho-imagery (http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/) </srcused>         <srcused>Rocky Mountain National Park GIS </srcused>         <srcused>Larimer County GIS data (http://www.co.larimer.co.us) </srcused>         <srcused>Grand County Parcel Maps (http://www.co.grand.co.us) </srcused>         <procdate>20101001 - 20120104 </procdate>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntperp>               <cntper>Daniel S.
