Repositories are increasingly being tasked to store all research items produced by an institution, within all subject areas. Within the creative arts, research objects can take many forms including 3D artefacts as well as 2D images. The challenge for repository administrators is how best to represent these items within a digital repository. This learning object will explore how metadata can best be used to represent still image items within a repository whether the image is the original item to be described or the representation of that item.

It aims to: explain what metadata is; explain the importance and purpose of metadata in a repository context; outline the key metadata standard in use within repositories; re-enforce the importance of using metadata standards within a repository to enable interoperability and harvesting.
