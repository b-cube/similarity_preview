In each event we strive to positively influence children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds perception of science and technology. We view K-12 EOT as a channel for technical professionals to engage young people in the pursuit of scientific and technical understanding. Our goal is for students to see these subjects as interesting, exciting, and worth further pursuit. By providing opportunities for pre-college students to engage in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) activities first hand, we hope to influence their choices of careers and field-of-study later in life. In this paper we give an account of our experiences with providing EOT: we describe several of our workshops and events; we provide details regarding techniques that we found to be successful in working with both students and instructors; we discuss program costs and logistics; and we describe our plans for the future.

Universities are always looking for ways to economize, both because of rising costs and because of growing awareness of ecological issues. Printing is a common target. Indiana University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Pervasive Technology Institute (PTI) compared several typefaces, looking at ink usage, paper usage, and readability. PTI chose to standardize on 11-point Times New Roman for printed documentation such as internal reports and white papers. PowerPoint presentations and other items with relatively small blocks of text are done in Century Gothic. Reports for external audiences will include a mix of fonts with deliberate mindfulness toward ink and paper usage. In short, if a message is rendered ineffective by its presentation, any ink or paper used can be considered wasted. </description> <dc:date>2012-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2022/14747\"> <title>Research Data Storage Available to Researchers Throughout the U.S. via the TeraGrid</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2022/14747</link> <description>Research Data Storage Available to Researchers Throughout the U.S. via the TeraGrid McCaulay, D. Scott; Link, Matt R. Many faculty members at small to mid-size colleges and universities do important, high quality research that requires significant storage. In many cases, such storage requirements are difficult to meet with local resources; even when local resources suffice, data integrity is best ensured by maintenance of a remote copy. Via the nationally-funded TeraGrid, Indiana University offers researchers at colleges and universities throughout the US the opportunity to easily store up to 1 TB of data within the IU data storage system. The TeraGrid is the National Science Foundation's flagship effort to create a national research cyberinfrastructure, and one key goal of the TeraGrid is to provide facilities that improve the productivity of the US research community generally. Providing facilities that improve the capacity and reliability of research data storage is an important part of this. This paper will describe the process for storing data at IU via the TeraGrid, and will in general discuss how this capability is part of a larger TeraGrid-wide data storage strategy.
