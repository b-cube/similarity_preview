It was formed in 1958 by the philosopher Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell, and the Rev Canon (Lewis) John Collins and grew out of the demonstration held outside the government's Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, Berkshire, at Easter 1956. Following a rapid growth of membership in its first years of existence, nuclear issues were overtaken by popular protest concerning the Vietnam War. CND survived, but as a much smaller movement. In 1960, the Committee of 100 was set up to organise Non-Violent Direct Action (NVDA) actions, such as mass sit-ins and blockades.          <lb/>  The decision, taken in 1979, to deploy American Cruise and Pershing missiles in Great Britain and other European countries led to a growth in CND membership and activities, such as protest marches and the harassment of Cruise convoys. Since the end of the Cold War, the emphasis of CND activities has changed to include lobbying of MPs and at international conferences, the tracking and publicising of road and rail shipments of nuclear materials, and the work of talking to people and groups, though there are still regular protests and direct actions at nuclear installations around the country. CND is part of Abolition 2000, a global network, founded in 1995 and with organised support in 76 countries, to press for the elimination of nuclear weapons.        </p>  </bioghist>  <scopecontent encodinganalog=\"3.3.1\">  <p>  Records of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), comprising papers relating to the CND's constitution, minutes of National Council, National Executive Committee and other committees and subject files, 1958-2008; General Secretary's correspondence, 1965-1996; annual conference papers, 1959-2008; papers relating to Aldermaston marches and other Easter demonstrations, 1961-2008; London Region CND minutes, correspondence and papers, 1959-2008; London Region CND papers relating to Aldermaston marches, 1960-1988; London Region CND correspondence with local CND groups and other organisations, 1960s; papers of the Colleges and Universities Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, 1960-1968; papers of the Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, 1961-2008; presscuttings, 1960s; press releases, 1981-2008; papers relating to Trade Union CND, 1981-2008; papers relating to demonstrations and campaigns, 1981-2008; minutes, reports and papers of regional CND groups, 1981-2008; local CND group newsletters, 1980-2008; pamphlets and publications, 1970-2008; papers of Ex-Services CND, Christian CND and other affiliated groups, 1984-2008, local group newsletters, c1985-2008; speeches and articles by Bruce Kent, 1981-1989.        </p>  </scopecontent>  <controlaccess>  <subject source=\"unesco\">Disarmament</subject>  <subject source=\"aim25\">Nuclear disarmament</subject>  <subject source=\"unesco\">Pacifism</subject>  <subject source=\"unesco\">Peace</subject>  <subject source=\"unesco\">Political doctrines</subject>  <subject source=\"unesco\">Political movements</subject>  <subject source=\"unesco\">Protest movements</subject>  <persname rules=\"ncarules\">Kent, Bruce, b 1929, campaigner for nuclear disarmament</persname>  <persname rules=\"ncarules\">Russell, Bertrand Arthur William, 1872-1970, 3rd Earl Russell, philosopher and social reformer</persname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Aldermaston march, annual CND march</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">British Peace Committee</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Campaign, newsletter of CND</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Christian Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">CND Today, newsletter of CND</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">CND</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Colleges and Universities Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CUCAND)</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Labour Party</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">National Council for Civil Liberties</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">National Peace Council</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Sanity, newsletter of CND</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Youth Action Council</corpname>  <corpname rules=\"ncarules\">Youth Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (YCND)</corpname>  <geogname rules=\"ncarules\" source=\"aim25\">London England</geogname>  </controlaccess>  <custodhist encodinganalog=\"3.2.3\">  <p>  Early material (1958-1971) was given by CND in 1971 (via the Modern Political Archives project).
