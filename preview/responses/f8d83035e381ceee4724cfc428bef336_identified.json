The rate of dissolution also appears to differ for the different components of the crucible - in some the matrix has largely gone in the interaction layer whereas quartz grains remain only partially dissolved, whereas in others (alumina-rich crucibles from later periods) there is less overall interaction of crucible with glass. There also appear to be differences in the rate of diffusion of different elements from the interaction layer [...] </content> </entry>  <entry xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>   <link rel='alternate' href='https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk:443/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ARCH-GLASS;ad794a10.1412' title='Re: ARCH-GLASS Digest - 9 Dec 2014 to 10 Dec 2014 (#2014-3) '/>   <author>      <name>Freestone, Ian</name>   </author>   <published>2014-12-11T09:12:15+00:00</published>   <updated>2014-12-11T09:12:15+00:00</updated>   <title>Re: ARCH-GLASS Digest - 9 Dec 2014 to 10 Dec 2014 (#2014-3) </title>   <id>https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk:443/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ARCH-GLASS;ad794a10.1412</id>   <content type='html'>Dear All&lt;br&gt;I am not so convinced about the possibilities of alumina contamination from a crucible. One can do the calculations quite easily to work out that a cylindrical crucible 10 cm internal diameter filled with 20 cm glass will contaminate the glass by about 0.5% Al2O3 for every 1 mm crucible lining lost, assuming an earthenware crucible with about 20% Al2O3. This number could go up if the crucible fabric was very dense or if the crucible was made of kaolinite.

Rather stupid of me to ignore the Serce Limani results here, but I&apos;m very grateful to have been made aware of this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the difficulties we have is that we simply need to run more analyses of Spanish glass. We&apos;re still not sure how much the variability in these glasses is a result of different provenances, or heterogeneous raw materials/production techniques/furnaces... We have just analysed several glasses from Malaga, and they have different compositions again (including a sample from a furnace wall with very high Al).
