The guidance for creating heat-related Nationally Consistent Data and Measures (NCDMs) were developed by funded tracking states. &#13;  </purpose> <supplinf>Data has been de-identified to protect patient confidentiality.  Heat-related case are selected based on discharge diagnosis coding: http://www.ehib.org/page.jsp?page_key=896#heat_classification&#13; &#13; The California EPHT Program receives calendar year inpatient hospitalization and emergency department data annually from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).  Further information on OSHPD is located at: http://www.oshpd.ca.gov.&#13; &#13; All state licensed hospitals in California are required by California Health and Safety Code to report to OSHPD data elements for each inpatient discharged from the hospital.  The facilities submit their data semiannually via the Medical information Reporting for California (MIRCal), an on-line data transmission method.  Additional fields are computed by OSHPD, such as, length of stay, etc.  The patient&apos;s Social Security Number is encrypted to create a unique 9-digit record linkage number, which can be used to link records for the same patient.     &#13; &#13; </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20120831</caldate> <time/> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.5</westbc> <eastbc>-114.1</eastbc> <northbc>42.0</northbc> <southbc>32.5</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ICD-9-CM</themekt> <themekey>Heat stroke and sunstroke; 9920, Heat syncope; 9921, Heat cramps; 9922, Heat exhaust-anhydrotic; 9923, Heat exhaust-salt deple; 9924, Heat exhaustion NOS; 9925, Heat fatigue transient; 9926, Heat edema; 9927, Heat effect NEC; 9928, Heat effect NOS; 9929, Excessive heat: weather; E9000, Excessive heat NOS; E9009,</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst> Restricted (secure) data will only be released to external users after the California EPHT Program and representatives from OSHPD have reviewed the request.

These data are based on discharge diagnosis codes (ICD9-CM).</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc> Since 1986, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) has been responsible for routinely collecting data on hospital discharges from every licensed acute care hospital in California, excluding federal hospitals.  Each year, OSHPD compiles the data from all hospitals to create the Patient Discharge Database (PDD).   &#13;&#13; Each year, CEHTP obtains the PDD dataset from OSHPD and creates datasets to be used for public health surveillance, while maintaining confidentiality.   &#13;&#13; This dataset on the CEHTP portal includes hospitalizations due to heat for May-September for the years 2000-2010 and emergency department visits due to heat for May-September for the years 2000 to 2005.  Each event is identified by looking at discharge diagnosis based on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).  A diagnostic ICD-9-CM code of 992, E900.0 or E900.9 indicates a patient was admitted to or seen at a hospital because of heat.  Each event is identified based on date of admission or date of event at the hospital, rather than date of discharge. &#13;&#13; Counts, rates, and confidence intervals were calculated by county, age-group, gender, and race/ethnicity. &#13;&#13; To calculate rates, we use population data from the California Department of Finance (DOF).  DOF uses year 2000 population data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and takes into account survival rates, migration patterns, and fertility rates for California to project the California population by county, race/ethnicity, age, and gender for 2000-2050 (State of California, Department of Finance, Population Projections for California and Its Counties 2000-2050, Sacramento, California, July 2007). &#13;&#13; Confidence intervals for rates of hospitalizations and ED visits are calculated using the Tiwari, Clegg, and Zou (Methods in Medical Research, 2006; 15:547-569).
