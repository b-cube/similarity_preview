Using short, animated, narrative films, 28 primary-aged children engaged in a 10-week programme that included the explicit instruction of comprehension strategies in small group settings. Baseline and final data relating to children's reading accuracy, rate and comprehension of written texts were gathered using a standardised reading assessment. Findings show that children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds reading comprehension scores showed significant improvement after the programme. Furthermore, reading accuracy scores also improved beyond expected levels even though no decoding of written words had occurred in the programme. While further research is needed, these findings offer a challenge to models of reading that potentially over-simplify the complex relationship between the word recognition and comprehension. More importantly, the findings point at the importance of using alternatives to written texts within the reading curriculum.

However, there is greater debate on whether the quality of education can and should be measured by learning outcomes. Even if learning outcomes are viewed as an appropriate measure, what type of outcomes should be measured? Offering lessons from the goals that were set in 2000, this article highlights the importance of making sure goals and targets are clear and measurable, and put equity at their heart. From a rights-based perspective, the paper proposes tracking progress towards a universal target that, at a minimum, ensures that all children, regardless of circumstance, complete primary school and achieve the basics in reading and mathematics. The paper illustrates the importance of adopting a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdstepping-stones\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd approach to ensure that no one is left behind by 2030, with interim targets that assess progress for the most disadvantaged.

Using a modified version of a survey item devised by James and Pedder (2006) for use with teachers in England, evidence was gathered about the assessment practices that were highly valued by teachers across international contexts. The extent of congruence between these values and teachers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd reported classroom practices was explored and dimensions of teachers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd assessment practices were derived through factor analysis. Whilst there was considerable congruence across the ALIC cohort of teachers and data sets derived from English teachers, particularly with respect to the items that have positive values-practice gaps, there were some interesting differences. Two components were derived from factor analysis, rather than the three derived by James and Pedder (2006). These components were \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMaking learning explicit and promoting learner autonomy\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStudent control of assessment processes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

The theoretical framework and the major features of the DIA are presented. It is argued that the DIA can be effectively implemented through five steps: Establishing clarity and consensus about aims and objectives, identifying needs and priorities for improvement through empirical investigation, provision of improvement guidelines, reflection opportunities and coaching on effective teaching by the advisory and research team, establishing a formative evaluation mechanism and finally establishing a summative evaluation system. Results of empirical studies providing support to the basic elements and the overall effectiveness of the DIA are also presented. Implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions for further research, particularly in exploring the conditions under which the DIA could have a long lasting effect on teacher effectiveness, are finally drawn. This is the accepted manuscript. The final version will be published by Taylor &amp; Francis. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
