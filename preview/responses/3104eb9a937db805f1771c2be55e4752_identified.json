Lidar data will serve multiple purposes, but have primarily been collected to (1) evaluate active faulting, slope instability, thaw settlement, erosion, and other engineering constraints along proposed pipeline routes, and (2) provide a base layer for the state-federal GIS database that will be used to evaluate permit applications and construction plans. The digital surface model represents percent canopy cover (between 0 and 1). Cover metric was computed in Fusion (McGaughey 2007), which assesses the percentage of total first returns within each cell that were returned from the canopy.  For more specifics on Fusion Gridmetric outputs see the fusion manual (page 56).</abstract> <purpose>Provide high resolution land canopy cover data for use in vegetation classification and analysis.</purpose> <supplinf> This metadata file has been written to document and describe, as a whole, all of the canopy cover files generated for this project. The canopy cover download package also includes the original metadata provided by Watershed Sciences, Inc. These metadata files may provide additional useful information that is specific to each file. The metadata files provided by Watershed Sciences, Inc. have not been reviewed for accuracy or compliance with FGDC standards.  In addition to information found in the metadata files, specific information about accuracy and quality of lidar data can be found in quality control reports provided by DOGAMI and delivery reports provided by Watershed Sciences. Individual reports were provided for each delivery set and have been combined by DGGS into comprehensive quality control and delivery reports. These documents are organized according to how data were delivered to DGGS. A description of how information pertaining to downloadable files can be found in the quality control and delivery reports is located in the directory with the reports. The DGGS metadata standard extends the FGDC standard to also include several elements that are required to facilitate our internal data management. These elements relate individual data items to a common dataset.

Ground control points were collected by McClintock Land Associates, a licensed surveying company, to be used as control comparison with lidar elevations. Refer to the lidar delivery report and lidar QC report for more details on the accuracy of the lidar data for each delivery area, including a comparison of GCP elevations with bare-earth digital elevation model elevations. The accuracy of the digital surface model representing percent canopy cover is dependent on the accuracy of the collected lidar data. Lidar 5 m grids were loaded into ArcGIS software for visual analysis.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>Lidar data have been examined to ensure that overlapping flight lines have consistent elevation values. Project specifications require that lidar consistency, measured as vertical offsets between adjacent flight lines, must average less than 0.15 meters.  Refer to the lidar QC report and the lidar delivery report for statistics from consistency analyses for individual delivery sets. Flight lines have been examined to ensure that there was at least 60% sidelap and that there are no data gaps.  Shaded relief, lidar slope, and bare-earth digital elevation model (DEM) images have been visually inspected for data errors such as pits, border artifacts, gaps, and shifting.  All grids were loaded and inspected for outlier/erroneous percent cover values.  All file naming conventions and formats have been checked for consistency. Canopy Cover rasters have been inspected to ensure cell values lie between 0 and 1.</logic> <complete>Lidar data have been checked for accuracy and completeness. Please refer to the lidar delivery report and lidar QC report for details about data accuracy completeness for individual delivery sets.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>True horizontal accuracy is regarded as a product of the lidar ground footprint. Lidar is referenced to co-acquired GPS base station data that have accuracies far greater than the value of the lidar footprint. The ground footprint is equal to 1/3333rd of the above - ground flying height. The ground footprint for data collected for this project exceeds typical accuracy of ground control used to reference the lidar data (less than 0.01 meters). Project specifications require the lidar footprint to be between 0.15 and 0.40 meters. Refer to the lidar QC report and lidar delivery report for additional information on horizontal accuracy for individual delivery areas.</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>McGaughey, R.J.</origin> <pubdate>2007</pubdate> <title>Fusion/LDV: Software for LIDAR data analysis and visualization</title> <geoform>software</geoform> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Pacific Northwest Research Station</pubplace> <publish>USDA Forest Service</publish> </pubinfo> <othercit>p. 28-30</othercit> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>paper</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2007</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>Publication Date</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>McGaughey, 2007</srccitea> <srccontr>Contains information about FUSION/LDV software</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc>Acquisition: The lidar data were collected between September and October 2010 and between May and July 2011. The survey used the Leica ALS60 system. Near-nadir scan angles were used to increase penetration of vegetation to ground surfaces.  Ground-level GPS and aircraft IMU were collected during the flight.</procdesc> <procdate>2010 and 2011</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Processing lidar data: (1) Flight lines and data were reviewed to ensure complete coverage of the study area and positional accuracy of the laser points. (2) Laser point-return coordinates were computed using ALS Post Processor software, IPAS Pro GPS/INS software, and Waypoint GPS, based on independent data from the lidar system, IMU, and aircraft. (3) The raw lidar file was assembled into flight lines per return with each point having an associated x, y, and z coordinate. (4) Visual inspection of swath-to-swath laser point consistencies in the study area were used to perform manual refinements of system alignment. (5) Custom algorithms were designed to evaluate points between adjacent flight lines.  Automated system alignment was computed based on randomly selected swath-to-swath accuracy measurements that consider elevation, slope, and intensities.  Specifically, refinement in the combination of system pitch, roll, and yaw-offset parameters optimize internal consistency. (6) Noise (e.g., pits and birds) was filtered using ALS post processing software, based on known elevation ranges, and included the removal of any cycle slips.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011, 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Hydro-flattening:  A combination of automated and manual detection and adjustment techniques was used to identify lake boundaries and water levels for closed water bodies with a surface area &gt; 150 square meters. Boundary polygons were developed using an algorithm that weights lidar-derived slopes, intensities, and return densities to detect the lake edge. Once detected, lake edges were manually reviewed and edited in a 3-D environment, and polygons were created with elevations computed from the filtered lidar returns. During the initial ground-modeling process returns from the water surface within each polygon were filtered and inspected for false low points. The elevation of each lake was computed as 5 cm above the minimum elevation of filtered-water surface cells within the lake polygon. Lake-boundary polygons were then incorporated into the final terrain model and enforced as hard breaklines. The initial ground classified-points falling within lake polygons were reclassified as water points and omitted from the final bare-earth DEM.</procdesc> <procdate>2010, 2011, 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Creation of bare-earth DEMs: (1) The TerraScan software suite was used to classify near-ground points. Geometric constraints were used to remove all points not near the earth. The resulting bare-earth ground model was then visually inspected and additional ground modeling was performed in site-specific areas to improve ground detail. (2) The corrected and filtered return points were compared to the real-time kinematic (RTK) ground survey points collected to verify the vertical and horizontal accuracies. (3) Points were output as laser points and, TINed.</procdesc> <procdate>2011, 2012</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Digital surface model representing percent canopy cover (between 0 and 1).
