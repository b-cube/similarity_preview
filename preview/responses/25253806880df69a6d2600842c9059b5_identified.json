The data set includes 12 7.5' quadrangles, which were digitized at the Mid-Continent Ecological Science Center from 1:24,000 scale hard copy maps developed by the U.S. Geological Survey, National Wetlands Research Center.  The seagrass beds were classified according to a NWRC derived classification scheme based on the C-CAP Coastal Land Cover Classification system of NOAA Coastwatch Change Analysis Project.</abstract> <purpose>The intended use of this data set is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the distribution and extent of seagrass habitat communities along the Northeast Gulf of Mexico.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>19920101</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Photography Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None Planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-86.750</westbc> <eastbc>-86.000</eastbc> <northbc>30.625</northbc> <southbc>30.250</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>Submerged Aquatic Vegetation</themekey> <themekey>Seagrass</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Choctawatchee Bay</placekey> <placekey>USA</placekey> <placekey>Florida</placekey> <placekey>FL</placekey> </place> <temporal> <tempkt>None</tempkt> <tempkey>1992</tempkey> </temporal> </keywords> <accconst>It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor described above or from another USGS Biological Resources Division server and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way.

Field verification was performed for areas where attribute classification was questionable; local personnel with state and federal agencies assisted in field identification.  The mylar-based 1:24,000 maps were checked by cartographic personnel for line and labelworks. The attribute accuracy is tested by manually comparing hard copy plots of the digital data with the source materials.  When attributes cannot be visually verified on plots they are interactively queried and verified on screen.  In addition, the attributes are compared against a master set of valid attributes.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>ARC/INFO software is used to create and maintain topological relationships between features.  There are no duplicate features, but coincident lines are maintained between data layers where appropriate.

After acquiring the aerial photography, stereo pairs were created and packaged according to 1:24,000 topographic maps; these maps also served as base maps for cartographic transformation work.  The photos were interpreted using a Bausch Lomb stereoscope at 10X magnification.  Cartographic work was performed using a Zoom Transfer Scope, and magnification varied according to source material scale.</procdesc> <procdate>1998</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Digitizing Process:  Mylar overlays were manually digitized using an Altek Datatab digitizer to capture the data at a resolution of at least 0.001 inches.  Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangle were used for registration during data collection.  Cover type features continuing onto adjacent quadrangles were adjusted to intersect the quad boundary at a common, coincident node.  Attributes were assigned as the data were digitized, or in an editing session after the digitizing was completed.</procdesc> <procdate>1998</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>Not applicable</indspref> <direct>Vector</direct> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <gridsys> <gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>16</utmzone> <transmer> <sfctrmer>.9996</sfctrmer> <longcm>-87</longcm> <latprjo>0</latprjo> <feast>500000</feast> <fnorth>0</fnorth> </transmer> </utm> </gridsys> <planci> <plance>coordinate pair</plance> <coordrep> <absres>.61</absres> <ordres>.61</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>meters</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>North American Datum of 1927</horizdn> <ellips>Clarke 1866</ellips> <semiaxis>6378206.4</semiaxis> <denflat>249.98</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>Submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)</enttypl> <enttypd>Aquatic vegetation, rooted, found up to 6 meters of water</enttypd> <enttypds>C-CAP Coastal Land Cover Classification System (NOAA):  Dobson, J.E., et.al NOAA Coastwatch Change Analysis Project.
