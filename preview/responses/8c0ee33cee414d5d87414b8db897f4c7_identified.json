Estimates of BFI values at ungaged streams and BFI-based ground-water recharge estimates are useful for interpreting relations between land use and water quality in surface and ground water.    </purpose>    <supplinf>(1) Background on the base-flow index (BFI):  Base flow is the component of streamflow that can be attributed to ground-water discharge into streams. The BFI is the ratio of base flow to total flow, expressed as a percentage.   The BFI grid was interpolated from BFI point values estimated for USGS streamgages (Wolock, 2003a). These point values were computed using an automated hydrograph separation computer program called the BFI program (Wahl and Wahl, 1988; 1995). Regarding this computer program, the BFI Web page (http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/twahl/bfi/index.html) states:  &quot;The BFI program was developed to make the base-flow separation process less tedious and more objective. The program implements a deterministic procedure proposed in 1980 by the British Institute of Hydrology (Institute of Hydrology, 1980). The method combines a local minimums approach with a recession slope test. The program estimates the annual base-flow volume of unregulated rivers and streams and computes an annual base-flow index (BFI, the ratio of base flow to total flow volume for a given year) for multiple years of data at one or more gage sites. Although the method may not yield the true base flow as might be determined by a more sophisticated analysis, the index has been found to be consistent and indicative of base flow, and thus may be useful for analysis of long term base-flow trends. Users should be very cautious about using methods such as this for short-term storm events or for locations where streamflow is affected by upstream regulation, such as reservoir releases. In general, the method interprets most regulated releases as base flow. If the program is used for regulated streams, the effects of regulation must be carefully accounted for through manual adjustment of the program output.&quot;  (2) Estimation of base-flow index (BFI) values for ungaged streams:  In a previous analysis of historical streamgage data (Wolock, 2003a), BFI values were estimated for more than 19,000 streamgages. Using a subset of this large dataset, a regression equation that could predict BFI values from drainage basin characteristics was developed, but the predictive power of the equation was limited. As an alternative approach, the BFI grid was produced (see Process_Description) and provided a statistically more powerful method to estimate BFI values at ungaged streams.   The method used to estimate a BFI value for an ungaged stream only requires that the drainage basin be delineated for that stream. The average value for the BFI grid within the drainage basin of the ungaged stream is used as the estimate of the BFI value for the stream. This method was applied to a set of 473 gaged streams (with drainage basin areas ranging from 32 to 119,000 square kilometers), and the grid-based and streamgage estimates of BFI values were compared. The percentage explained variance (R-square value) was 67 percent in the analysis.  (3) Estimation of natural ground-water recharge throughout the conterminous United States:  A raster dataset of natural ground-water recharge can be created by multiplying the grid of base-flow index (BFI) values by a grid of mean annual runoff values. For example, Wolock (2003b) created a natural ground-water recharge dataset by multiplying the BFI grid by a mean annual runoff grid derived from Gebert&apos;s 1951-80 mean annual runoff contour map (Gebert and others, 1987). This approach is similar to those reported in some other studies (Holtschlag, 1997; Dumouchelle and Schiefer, 2002).  The concept used to generate a natural ground-water recharge grid in this manner is based on two assumptions: (1) long-term average natural ground-water recharge is equal to long-term average natural ground-water discharge, and (2) the BFI reasonably represents, over the long term, the percentage of ground-water discharge in streamflow. This approach to estimating ground-water recharge is likely to underestimate &quot;true&quot; recharge in areas where irrigation is used extensively and also in areas where ground-water evapotranspiration is significant. More details about the approach and its limitations can be found in Wolock (2003b).

The streamgage BFI values were computed for each of the USGS streamgages in the historical database (more than 19,000 stations) using a Fortran program written by Tony Wahl (Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of the Interior) and Ken Wahl (USGS) (http://www.usbr.gov/pmts/hydraulics_lab/twahl/bfi/) (Wahl and Wahl, 1988; 1995).   A subset of the streamgage BFI values was selected before the interpolation process. The criteria for including a streamgage in the interpolation were (1) a period of record of at least 10 years of daily streamflow data, and (2) a maximum drainage basin area of 1,000 square miles (2,590 square kilometers). The first criterion selects streamgages with a reasonably long period of record, thereby averaging year-to-year variability in BFI values. The second criterion minimizes the effects of routing within the stream network on BFI values. Applying these selection criteria resulted in a point dataset of 8,249 streamgage BFI values. The mean period of record in the dataset was 33 years, and the mean drainage basin area was 204 square miles (528 square kilometers).  The point dataset of streamgage BFI values was interpolated to a raster dataset using the ARCINFO inverse distance weighting interpolation method. (The use of firm, trade, and brand names is for identification purposes only and does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Geological Survey.) The grid-cell size was set to 1 kilometer, and default interpolation parameter values were used except for the &quot;power&quot; parameter, which was set to a value of 0.5. The &quot;power&quot; parameter controls the significance of surrounding points on the interpolated value; a higher value results in less effect from distant points. Using a &quot;power&quot; value of 0.5 produced a smooth interpolated grid that performed the best in statistical tests (see Supplemental_Information).
