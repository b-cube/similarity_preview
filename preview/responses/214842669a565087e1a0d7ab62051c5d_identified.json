For me, one of the most intriguing proposals in the report is the call for a Place Leadership Council (PLC) in relation to which Farrell makes a number of concrete proposals:</rss:description>       <dc:subject>The Bartlett, UCL's global faculty of the built environment.</dc:subject>       <dc:creator>Matthew P Carmona</dc:creator>              <dc:date>2014-05-20T10:25:51Z</dc:date>                                 </rss:item>           <rss:item rdf:about=\"https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/cross-faculty-initiatives/urban-design/urban-design-matters/farrell-review-urban-design-matters\">       <rss:title>42: 'Our future in place' \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or is it?</rss:title>       <rss:link>https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/cross-faculty-initiatives/urban-design/urban-design-matters/farrell-review-urban-design-matters</rss:link>       <rss:description> On coming to power in 2010, Ed Vaizey, a long-term enthusiast for modern architecture, was the UK coalition government\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds first choice as Minister for Architecture.
