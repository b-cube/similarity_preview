The transfer resistances of tracers with a wide range of solubilities were measured, including species with medium solubility and environmentally important tracers such as DMS and acetone.&lt;br /&gt; The resistance addition model of Liss and Slater (1974) was tested with a combined Schmidt number scaling. The air-sided (water-sided) part of the total resistance was determined using tracers controlled by only one side because of their either very high or low solubility. The total resistance is obtained by adding both parts. Computed and measured transfer resistances agree well.&lt;br /&gt; It is shown that the value of solubility for which the air and water-side transfer resistances are equal depends both on the friction velocity as well as on the coverage of the water surface with surfactants.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:publisher/><dc:date>2012-05-08</dc:date><dc:source>http://zenodo.org/record/12328</dc:source><dc:doi>10.5281/zenodo.12328</dc:doi><dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12328</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12328</dc:identifier></dc:dc>   </collection>",
