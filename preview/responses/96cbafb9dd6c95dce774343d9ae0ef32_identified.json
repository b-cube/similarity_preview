But there may have been more to it than that. We have reason to think that while <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> was away in <placeName key=\"Messenia\">Messenia</placeName> with an Athenian army, the people in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, under the leadership of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> and <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name>, enacted a radical democratic reform by limiting the powers of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"ReformsBehindBack\" n=\"ReformsBehindBack\"> <head>Democratic Reforms Behind Cimon&#8217;s Back</head>  <p>First there is the question of why the Spartans, after summoning the Athenians to help, suddenly changed their minds and dismissed them. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> says that the Spartans saw the Athenians as <quote>revolutionaries</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">newterista/s</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut. Cim.\" n=\"Plut. Cim. 17.2\">Plut. <title>Cim.</title> 17.2</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Thucydides</name> expands on this, saying that the Spartans, <quote>apprehensive of the enterprising and revolutionary character of the Athenians, and further looking upon them as foreigners, began to fear that if they remained, they might be tempted by the besieged in <placeName key=\"Ithome\">Ithome</placeName> to attempt some political changes. They accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies, without declaring their suspicions, but merely saying that they had now no need of them</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">dei/santes tw=n *)aqhnai/wn to\\\\ tolmhro\\  kai\\\\ th\\  newteropoii/an, kai\\\\ a)llofu/lous a(/ma h(ghsa/menoi, mh/ ti, h)\\  paramei/nwsin, u(po\\\\ tw=n e)n *)iqw/mh| peisqe/ntes newteri/swsi, mo/nous tw=n cumma/xwn a)pe/pemyan, th\\  me\\  u(poyi/an ou) dhlou=ntes, ei)po/ntes de\\\\ o(/ti ou)de\\  prosde/ontai au)tw=n e)/ti</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Thucydides\" work=\"Thuc.\" n=\"Thuc. 1.102\">Thuc. 1.102</bibl>).</p>  <p>Second, there are several passages from ancient authors that say that democratic reforms were passed in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> while <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> was away. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> suggests this, in very general terms, in his biography of <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name>. Once <name type=\"person\">Aristides</name> was dead, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> says, and <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> was banished and <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> was generally absent on campaigns, <quote><name type=\"person\">Pericles</name> decided to devote himself to the people, espousing the cause of the poor and the many instead of the few and the rich, contrary to his own nature, which was anything but popular</quote> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut. Per.\" n=\"Plut. Per. 7.2\">Plut. <title>Per.</title> 7.2</bibl>). In his biography of <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> he is more specific, saying that after <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name>&#8217;s trial and acquittal, he opposed any democratic reforms, <quote>but when he sailed away again on military service, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">People</xref> got completely beyond control. They confounded the established political order of things and the ancestral practices which they had formerly observed, and under the lead of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> they robbed the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref> of all but a few of the cases in its jurisdiction</quote> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut. Cim.\" n=\"Plut. Cim. 15.1\">Plut. <title>Cim.</title> 15.1</bibl>).</p>  <p>Third, there is evidence to suggest that democratic reforms, and particularly a reform of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>, were enacted specifically by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">People</xref> generally, the d&#275;mos (<foreign lang='grc'>dh=mos</foreign>), in the absence of <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> and the wealthier Athenians. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Diodorus</name> says that it was the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> (<foreign lang='grc'>e)kklhsi/a</foreign>), the most democratic institution in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, that reformed the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref> (<bibl author=\"Diodorus\" work=\"Diod.\" n=\"Diod. 11.77.6\">Diod. 11.77.6</bibl>). More interesting still, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> attributes the democratic reforms after the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Persian Wars\">Persian Wars</xref>, and particularly the changes to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>, to the <quote>naval multitude</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">o( nautiko\\\\s o)/xlos</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Pol. 1304a 20\">Aristot. <title>Pol.</title> 1304a 20</bibl>). This <quote>naval multitude</quote> refers to the citizens who were not wealthy enough to provide themselves with bronze armor, but could nevertheless serve as rowers on warships.</p>  <p>Fourth, and finally,<name type=\"ancientAuthor\"> Plutarch</name>&#8217;s biography of <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name>, unlike his biography of <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name>, explicitly connects <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name>&#8217;s ostracism with <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>&#8217; reform of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>, which he calls here the <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref></soCalled>: <quote> Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>, but <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> also, on the charge of being a lover of <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName> and a hater of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref>, was <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Ostracism\">ostracized</xref></quote> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut. Per.\" n=\"Plut. Per. 9.4\">Plut. <title>Per.</title> 9.4</bibl>).</p>  <p>If we put these four categories of evidence together, we might (tentatively) reconstruct events as follows: In <date value=\"-462\">462 BCE</date> the Spartans sent for Athenian help during the siege of <placeName key=\"Ithome\">Ithome</placeName> in <placeName key=\"Messenia\">Messenia</placeName>. <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> marched south with an army that consisted of those Athenians wealthy enough to afford the bronze armor necessary for fighting on land. While this army was gone, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> at <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, with a smaller-than-usual number of wealthy citizens participating, passed democratic reforms, including a reform of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>. Word of this reached <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName>, and the Spartans (who did not look kindly on reform, certainly not democratic reform) decided that the Athenians were dangerous to have around and so dismissed them. Upon returning to <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name>, who was known for his good relationship with <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName> and for opposing reforms such as had just been passed, was <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Ostracism\">ostracized</xref>.</p>  <p>It is important to note that the preceding paragraph is one possible interpretation of a few pieces of evidence. The evidence, by itself, does not give a full, or consistent, picture of events.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"OpposedReforms\" n=\"OpposedReforms\"> <head>The Reforms that Cimon Opposed</head>  <p>For a full description of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref> (sometimes called the <soCalled>Council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>,</soCalled> and sometimes simply <soCalled>the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref></soCalled>, after the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Areopagus, Athens\">Hill of the Areopagus</name>, where it convened) and the reforms of <date value=\"-462\">462 BCE</date>, see the entries under <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref> and <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>. What follows is a very condensed account, to illustrate the democratic changes to the government of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> that <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> opposed.</p>  <p>In the earliest stages of the Athenian government that our sources describe, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref> was the most important governing body.

Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 3.6\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 3.6</bibl>). In the time of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name>, who (according to legend) first gave <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> a code of laws, <quote>The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref> was guardian of he laws, and kept a watch on the magistrates (<foreign lang='grc'>ta\\\\s a)rxa/s</foreign>) to make them govern in accordance with the laws. A person unjustly treated might lay a complaint before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref>, stating the law in contravention of which he was treated unjustly</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

Both of these passages are rather vague as to the details of the functions of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>, but its importance is clear.</p>  <p>As <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> became gradually more democratic, in the years leading up to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Persian Wars\">Persian Wars</xref> (c. <dateRange from=\"-481\" to=\"-479\">481-479 BCE</dateRange>: source <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OHCW</title></bibl>), the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> seems to have lost some of its authority. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> says in his <title>Politics</title> that <name type=\"person\">Solon</name>&#8212;the partly legendary, partly historical Athenian lawgiver of the <dateRange from=\"-599\" to=\"-550\">early 6th century BCE</dateRange> (source: <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OCD</title><edition>3</edition></bibl>)&#8212;reformed the Athenian constitution by mixing democratic elements (the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">law-courts</xref>), aristocratic elements (the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">elected offices</xref>) and oligarchic elements (the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref>) (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

However, during the chaos of the Persian invasion in <date value=\"-480\">480 BCE</date>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref> took a leading role in organizing, and financing, the evacuation of all Athenians to <placeName key=\"Salamis\">Salamis</placeName> and the <placeName key=\"Peloponnese\">Peloponnese</placeName>, which raised the body&#8217;s status considerably (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 23.1\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 23.1</bibl>).</p>  <p>While the evacuation of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> raised the prestige of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, the ensuing battle in the sea by <placeName key=\"Salamis\">Salamis</placeName> may have helped bring about its later fall from power.

First, <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name>, who was a leader of those who favored democracy (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath.

The sources do not agree, however, as to who initiated that reform. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> says that it was <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> who, <quote>broke down the power of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref></quote> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut.

But elsewhere in the same work he says that the reform was organized by <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> and <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

We should probably conclude, although cautiously, that <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> was the principle reformer, but that he acted with the advice and support of <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name>. <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> is the name most often associated with the reforms, and the following passage from <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> suggests that, while <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name> was a leader of the democratic movement, it was <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> who enacted this particular reform: <quote>For this reason all the more did <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name>, strong in the affections of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref>, lead a successful party against the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref>. Not only was the Council robbed of most of its jurisdiction by <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>, but <name type=\"person\">Cimon</name> also, on the charge of being a lover of <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName> and a hater of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref>, was <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Ostracism\">ostracized</xref>.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut.

They are discussed at length in the articles on <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> and on the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Court of the Areopagus</xref>, but they can be summarized briefly here. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> says that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref> lost jurisdiction over almost all <emph>kriseis</emph>, <quote>judgements</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">kri/seis</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut.

Our best evidence for what authority remained in the hands of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref> comes from subsequent trials that appeared before it.
