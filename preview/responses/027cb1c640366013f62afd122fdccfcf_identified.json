The Personal Health Records (PHR) is presented as new technological approaches aimed at standardizing electronic management of medical information between the patient and its physicians, as well as among medical organizations collaborating in providing integrated medical care services. We describe roles and aims behind electronic health recording, follow with applicable legal and standardizations frameworks and European activities in this area, leading towards introduction to most common commercial as well as open-source implementations of such systems and concluding with indication of specific adaptations enabling the use of stored personal health data for scientific research into causes and evaluation of chronic illnesses. We also describe ethical and privacy concerns that are relevant to using and exchanging electronic health information.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/287720</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/288692</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:13115</identifier><datestamp>2014-12-05T16:02:51Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-fp7-ict-strokeback</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Vogiatzaki, Emmanouela</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Gravezas, Yannis </dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Krukowski, Artur</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Rehabilitation System for Stroke Patients using Mixed-Reality and Immersive User Interfaces</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-07-02</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-zero</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/13115</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.13115</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;The work presented in this paper addresses stroke, a disease costing the healthcare in Europe and USA over 3% of their entire healthcare expenditure, including inpatient treatments, outpatient hospital visits and long-term rehabilitation and care.

Therefore there is an urgent need for devising an effective long-term care and rehabilitation strategy for stroke patients, which would actively involve patients in the rehabilitation process while minimizing costly human support. This paper reports on the ongoing developments of the serious gaming approach to an integrated rehabilitation training for post-stroke patients employing the Unity3D virtual reality environment combined with a hybrid of advanced media technologies and immersive user interfaces. The proposed approach empowers the patients and their caretakers for effective application of rehabilitation protocols in their home settings, while leading physicians are enabled to supervise the progress of the rehabilitation (and intervene if needed) through the use of Personal Health Record (PHR) system. The increased rehabilitation speed and ability to perform training at home directly improves quality of life of patients.

In average the healthcare expenditure cost for Strokes across different countries in Europe and USA is 3% of their entire healthcare expenditure. This includes inpatient treatment cost, outpatient hospital visits and long-term rehabilitation and care. Analysis showed that costs of long-term care have increased from 13% to 49% of overall costs in average in recent years. Therefore there is an urgent need for devising an effective long-term care and rehabilitation strategy for Stroke patients, which will involve the patients actively in the process while minimising costly human intervention. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;StrokeBack&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;project intends to develop an automated remote rehabilitation system by blending advances of ICT and practical clinical knowledge that will empower the patients and their immediate carer for effective application of the rehabilitation protocol in home settings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;StrokeBack&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will combine state-of-the-art monitoring devices forming a wireless Body Area Network that enable simultaneous measurement of multiple vital parameters and currently executed movements that are particularly of interest from a Stroke rehabilitation point of view. The measured parameters will be fused using advanced feature extraction and classification algorithms processed on-body, which will denote the accuracy of the executed exercise. The training parameters along with vital data will be stored in a patient health record to which the responsible clinicians and therapists have access so that they can dynamically update the rehabilitation program. By employing manual intervention only when actually necessary, it will eliminate costly human intervention and thereby significantly reduce the associated costs. The increased rehabilitation speed as well as the fact that the rehabilitation training can be done at home directly improves quality of life of patients. To sum up,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;StrokeBack&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will increase rehabilitation speed while reducing cost.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record></ListRecords> </OAI-PMH>  ",
