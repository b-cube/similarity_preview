The WSUD approach aims to influence design and planning from the moment rainwater is captured in dams, to when it is treated, and reticulated to consumers, and extending to the point of wastewater re-use, as well as stormwater use. The study identified 8 WSUD sub-activities stemming from 4 main WSUD activities, implemented by the George Local Municipality. Water debtors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd data were sourced in order to measure the effect of 3 of the 8 WSUD sub-activities on water consumption in selected areas. The analysis confirmed that the three WSUD sub-activities had a short-term impact on reducing water consumption in the suburbs where they were implemented. It is recommended that the municipality focus on improved planning and implementation of a diverse range of WSUD activities and implementing information and monitoring systems to evaluate the impact of these measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Drought relief strategies, George Municipality, integrated urban water management, South Africa, water sensitive urban design&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>N Lottering</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>D du Plessis</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>R Donaldson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110359\">        <title>Using soil-specific partition coefficients to improve accuracy of the new South African guideline for contaminated land</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110359</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Contaminated land in South Africa is regulated through the National Environmental Management Waste Act (Act 59 of 2008) (NEMWA) and the National Norms and Standards for the Remediation of Contaminated Land and Soil Quality (NSCLA) (GN R.331 of 2014). These standards were obtained from the Framework for the Management of Contaminated Land. A soil screening value (SSV1) for the protection of groundwater resources is proposed which is based on a 2-phase (stage) equilibrium partitioning and dilution model which includes a dilution factor and partitioning coefficient (Kd), converting the water quality guideline to a total soil screening value. The appropriateness of the screening values has been questioned because of the uncertainties surrounding the Kd values used by the Framework. This paper investigates the Kd values of Cu, Pb, and V for selected South African diagnostic soil horizons to evaluate the reliability of the current Kd values used by the Framework during Phase 1 screening. The Kd values of Cu for the 10 horizons ranged between 13 and 19 044 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, all exceeding the value of 10 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; provided by the Framework. For Pb the values ranged from 25 to &amp;gt;252 294 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; as compared to the Framework\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds 100 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Similarly, the Kd value of 200 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for V recommended by the Framework is higher than the measured Kd value of 15 to 173 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for all 10 diagnostic horizons. This study demonstrated that the observed wide Kd value ranges for each element were related to the variation in basic soil properties such as soil pH, organic carbon, clay, Fe, and Al content. Therefore, the Kd values for Cu, Pb, and V currently used by the Framework are not representative of typical South African diagnostic soil horizons. Linear regression models were developed for the prediction of Cu, Pb, and\\ufffd\\ufffdV Kd values from measured soil properties, which could be used to generate soil-specific Kd values.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: Kd value, contaminated land, NEMWA, screening value, risk, soil&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>M Papenfus</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>EH Tesfamariam</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>PC de Jager</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>CS Steyn</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>JE Herselman</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110360\">        <title>Effects of salinity on the survival of the Brackwater mussel, &lt;i&gt;Brachidontes virgiliae&lt;/i&gt;, in the St Lucia estuarine system, South Africa</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110360</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;During drought periods, the razor clam &lt;em&gt;Solen cylindraceus&lt;/em&gt; is the dominant bivalve in the St Lucia estuarine system, although restricted to its South Lake region. However, with the recent onset of a wet phase, the mussel &lt;em&gt;Brachidontes virgiliae&lt;/em&gt; has become widespread and overwhelmingly dominant throughout the system. The salinity tolerance of &lt;em&gt;B. virgiliae&lt;/em&gt; is here determined using both rapid and gradual changes in salinity. Mussels were collected at Esengeni in the Narrows (salinity \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 0) and Lister\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Point in False Bay (salinity \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 20). Mortalities were recorded for animals exposed to a sudden change in salinity using 8 different treatments, ranging from 0 to 70. Additionally, animals were exposed to a gradual change in salinity, using treatments that exceeded the minimum and maximum salinities mussels were previously able to tolerate. In all four experiments, animals were able to tolerate salinity levels up to 20. However, a wider salinity tolerance, up to 50, was shown by animals collected from Lister\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Point and those gradually acclimated to test conditions. With an increase in flood events predicted for this region, it is imperative to understand how key species may be affected. During wet phases &lt;em&gt;B. virgiliae&lt;/em&gt; becomes ubiquitious throughout Lake St Lucia and it is unlikely that the species will disappear from the system, even if floods escalate in the future, as it has an ability to withstand near-freshwater conditions. During dry periods, however, the mussel will be concentrated in the Narrows (oligohaline to limnetic conditions), especially if an inverse salinity gradient with hypersaline conditions prevails within the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: bivalves, range shift, wet and dry periods, hypersaline conditions, flood events, iSimangaliso Wetland Park&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>HA Nel</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>R Perissinotto</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>RH Taylor</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110361\">        <title>The relationship between concurrently measured SASS (South African Scoring System) and turbidity data archived in the South African River Health Programme\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Rivers Database</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110361</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The need for monitoring the biological impacts of instream sediments has long been recognised, yet robust and scientifically defensible tools for doing so are still in the early stages of development because of the difficulties experienced by researchers in characterising the complicated mechanisms of biological effect elicited by sediment particles. Biological monitoring is one such tool, and this paper reports on the initial stages of a study to determine the most applicable approach for measuring the effects of instream sediments on aquatic macroinvertebrates in the South African context. In this first instance, the suitability of the rapid macroinvertebrate biomonitoring tool (the South African Scoring System) was investigated by determining the extent of the correlation between concurrently measured SASS metrics and turbidity data collected for the South African River Health Programme. All three SASS metrics \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd SASS score, number of taxa (NOT), and average score per taxon (ASPT) \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd were found to be significantly negatively correlated with turbidity, although variation in the data was high. Turbidity was found to be the major driver of change in ASPT. In contrast, electrical conductivity was the major driver of SASS scores and NOT, with turbidity a close second. When combined, electrical conductivity and turbidity accounted for 80% (SASS score) and 75% (NOT) of the variation in the regression model. Consequently, SASS metrics are a crude, but reliable, indicator of the negative biological implications of excessive instream sedimentation as measured by turbidity. A number of other potential biomonitoring approaches for detecting the impacts of fine sediment exposure are identified for further investigation: spatial analyses of macroinvertebrate assemblages; and the use of structural and functional metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: aquatic macroinvertebrates, suspended sediment, biomonitoring&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>AK Gordon</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>NJ Griffin</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>CG Palmer</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110394\">        <title>Electrospun fibre colorimetric probe based on gold nanoparticles for on-site detection of 17\\ufffd\\ufffd-estradiol associated with dairy farming effluents</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/110394</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;An on-site colorimetric probe, based on gold nanoparticles incorporated into electrospun polystyrene nanofibres, for the detection of oestrogenic compounds, as represented by 17\\ufffd\\ufffd-estradiol, in dairy effluents is presented.

DEMs from different sources exhibit data-resolution effects on the important derived geomorphological properties of watersheds used in rainfall\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrunoff modelling. Using DEMs derived from topography maps (TOPO DEM) and the SRTM DEM, it was illustrated that different threshold areas for stream network extraction affect GIUH model performance. The results show that the SRTM DEM gives higher values for sub-basin and channel slope as well as number of streams, than the TOPO DEM, while mean length of overland and channel flow is greater for the latter source. The results also indicate that peak flow and slope of the hydrograph rising limb obtained from the SRTM DEM at different threshold areas (ranging from 0.25% to 3%) are greater than that for the TOPO DEM. Investigating the effects of stream network delineation threshold area on the simulated peak flow shows that the maximum and minimum differences (12% and 1%) occur at the threshold areas of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, while for threshold areas higher than 2% the difference in peak flow of the two sources is limited to 10%. Based on the results of this research, it is deduced that the effects of data resolution and stream network delineation threshold areas on the geomorphological parameter values and the performance of GIUH-based models are significant and should be\\ufffd\\ufffd considered when using SRTM DEMs in ungauged watersheds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: SRTM DEM, topographic maps, rainfall\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrunoff Modelling, KW-GIUH, threshold area&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>A Azizian</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>A Shokoohi</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112106\">        <title>Investigating a spatial approach to groundwater quantity management using radius of influence with a case study of South Africa</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112106</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether a simple, spatially-based approach to groundwater sustainability using radius of influence should be used to replace the pervasive, yet deprecated, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnatural recharge water\\ufffd\\ufffd balance\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd volumetric method.

(2011). Annual evapotranspiration is strongly dependent on rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) in 4 climatically different regions of South Africa. Average ET in South Africa (2000\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2012) was estimated to be 303 mm\\ufffd\\ufffda-1 or 481.4 x 109 m3\\ufffd\\ufffda1 (14% of PET and 67% of rainfall), mainly in the form of plant transpiration (T, 53%) and soil evaporation (Soil E, 39%). Evapotranspiration (ET) showed a slight tendency to decrease over the period 2000\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2012 in all climatic regions, except in the south of the country (winter rainfall areas), although annual variations in ET resulted in the 13-year trends not being statistically significant. Evapotranspiration (ET) was spatially dependent on PET, T and vapour pressure deficit (VPD), in particular in winter rainfall and arid to semi-arid climatic regions. Assuming an average rainfall of 450 mm\\ufffd\\ufffda-1, and considering current best estimates of runoff (9% of rainfall), groundwater recharge (5%) and water withdrawal (2%), MOD16 ET estimates were about 15% short of the water balance closure in South Africa.

After a decade dominated by dry and hypersaline conditions, the St Lucia system has changed dramatically with the onset of a new wet phase in 2011. In response, A. ambassis has expanded its distribution throughout the system. Stable \\ufffd\\ufffd15N and \\ufffd\\ufffd13C isotope analysis was used in conjunction with gut content analysis to elucidate the diet of this species at 5\\ufffd\\ufffd representative sampling localities. Zooplankton as well as terrestrial and aquatic insects were prevalent in the diet. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed a considerable dietary overlap for the fish collected at the different localities. Seasonally, trophic position differed significantly, with the dry season showing consistently higher isotopic signatures at all sites. A significant relationship was identified between trophic position, salinity and temperature, indicating the potential effect of these variables on the diet. The ability of &lt;em&gt;A. ambassis&lt;/em&gt; to link lower trophic level organisms, such as zooplankton, with larger piscivorous predators is thus indicative of the vital role this species occupies in the food webs of the St Lucia system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Ambassis ambassis&lt;/em&gt;, iSimangaliso Wetland Park, stable isotopes, gut content analysis, fish diet&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>DC Dyer</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>R Perissinotto</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>NK Carrasco</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112123\">        <title>Reducing uncertainty based on model fitness: Application to a reservoir model</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112123</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis are important tools in the modelling process: they assign confidence to model results, can aid in focusing monitoring and preservation efforts, and can be used in model simplification. A weakness of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis methodologies is the often subjective definition of prior parameter probability distributions, especially in data-poor areas. We apply Monte Carlo filtering in conjunction with quantitative variance-based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to address this weakness and define parameter probability distributions in the absence of measured data. This general methodology is applied to a reservoir model of the Okavango Delta, Botswana. In addition to providing a methodology for setting prior parameter distributions, results show that the use of Monte Carlo filtering reduces model uncertainty and produces simulations that better represent the calibrated ranges. Thus, Monte Carlo filtering increases the accuracy and precision of parametric model uncertainty. Results also show that the most important parameters in our model are the volume thresholds, the reservoir area/volume coefficient, floodplain porosity, and the island extinction coefficient. The reservoir representing the central part of the wetland, where flood waters separate into several independent distributaries, is a keystone area within the model. These results identify critical areas and parameters for monitoring and managing, refine and reduce input/output uncertainty, and present a transferable methodology for developing parameter probability distribution functions, especially when using empirical models in data-scarce areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, Monte Carlo filtering, reservoir model, Okavango Delta&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>AC Linhoss</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>R Mu\\ufffd\\ufffdoz-Carpena</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>G Kiker</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>P Wolski</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112124\">        <title>Analysis of grey-water used for irrigating vegetables and possible effects on soils in the vicinity of Umtata Dam, Eastern Cape</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112124</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the search for alternative and reliable water sources to irrigate vegetables for backyard gardens, an experimental field was set up in the vicinity of the Umtata Dam, north-west of the town of Umtata, to test grey-water quality and its effects on soil nutrient content following 4 successive growing seasons. Samples of grey-water that were generated from informal housing adjacent to the Umtata Dam were collected from kitchen and bath tubs/washing basins. These samples were analysed before being used for irrigating vegetable crops. The results showed that grey-water quality was \\ufffd\\ufffdefit for purpose\\ufffd\\ufffdf for irrigating edible vegetable plants. Although the average Na+ (16 mg/.) and Cl- (15 mg/.) ions were significantly higher (p = 0.05) for grey-water than other treatments, both were below the limit of 100 mg/. set in the South African Water Quality Guidelines. The concentrations of nutrients and heavy metals found in the grey-water samples were significantly lower compared to the World Health Organization guidelines for the safe use of grey-water and within the target water quality range (TWQR) prescribed by South African guidelines for irrigation water. However, the study strongly recommends that grey-water be diluted in order to lower the salt content and to improve the irrigation water quality. Results from an analysis of soil samples showed no significant differences in pH as a result of applying grey-water throughout the soil profile of up to 90 cm depth. Na content of the soil irrigated with grey-water was not significantly different than that of plots where diluted grey-water and potable water were used. Therefore, the grey-water used in this study does not appear to cause an accumulation of salts and heavy metals in soil, in the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: grey-water, vegetables, soil, heavy metals, pH&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>LL Mzini</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>K Winter</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112126\">        <title>Aluminium hydro(oxide)\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbased (AO) adsorbent for defluoridation of drinking water: Optimisation, performance comparison, and field testing</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112126</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, the performance of different aluminium hydroxide.based adsorbents was compared in terms of fluoride adsorption capacity, potential for repetitive regeneration, surface acidity and surface site concentrations. The adsorbents were aluminium hydro(oxide) (AO), activated alumina (AA), and pseudoboehmite (PB). The AO adsorbent was synthesised at different OH:Al ratios to optimise the fluoride adsorption capacity. The AO was pilot tested in a rural community in the Ethiopian Rift Valley where groundwaters are heavily enriched with fluoride. The maximum fluoride uptake was achieved for the AO adsorbent synthesised at OH:Al ratios between 2.5 and 2.7. The fluoride adsorption capacity of the adsorbents determined from mini-column studies was found to be 10.6, 1.9, and 2.4 mg/g for AO, AA, and PB, respectively. This significant difference in fluoride adsorption capacity is strongly related to the surface acidity and surface site concentration. The surface acidity (1.57 meq/g) and surface site concentration (0.74 meq/g) for AO is higher than that for AA and PB. The elemental composition analysis showed that AO has a lower % Al2O3 content than AA and PB, but higher sulphate (19.4%) and iron (2.2%) content. High resolution 27Al Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (27Al MAS NMR) spectra of AO, AA, and PB were recorded, to analyse the coordination geometry of solid Al species and the results showed that aluminium is coordinated octahedrally and tetrahedrally in all cases. Regeneration experiments showed that AA and PB can be regenerated for more than 3 cycles, whereas the potential for regeneration of AO for more than 3 cycles is limited. The results from a community defluoridation plant showed that fluoride in the feed water (8.10 mg/.) is removed below 0.1 mg/.. The average adsorption capacity was determined to be 2.11 mg/g based on continuous field monitoring results obtained until the fluoride content in the treated water exceeded the breakthrough value of 1.5 mg/..

Pesticides, particularly fungicides, have been shown to competitively bind or affect expression of the AR in an inhibiting manner. Few studies have addressed anti-androgenic effects of agrochemical use in South Africa. The aim of this study was to screen for the ability of commonly-used pesticides (mostly fungicides) in Western Cape agricultural areas to alter the binding of an androgen (DHT) to the human AR (hAR) using a recombinant yeast androgen screen (YAS), and also to test the additivity mixture interaction hypothesis when commonly-used pesticides with similar modes of action (MOAs) are exposed in mixture. Fungicides vinclozolin, folpet, procymidone, dimethomorph, fenarimol, mancozeb, and the insecticide chlorpyrifos, all independently antagonised the binding of the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to the AR in a dose-dependent manner. The fungicide mancozeb was found to be the most potent anti-androgen in the assay. Binary, equimolar mixtures of the pesticides also antagonised the binding of DHT to the AR, but at lower IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentration potencies relative to their individual counterparts. The mixtures of the majority of the selected pesticides did not conform to the expected additive mixture interaction. Only the mixture between dimethomorph and mancozeb showed an additive mixture response at IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations, and, therefore, revealed a more severe AR antagonistic effect compared to their individual counterparts. This study confirmed that pesticides regularly used in agriculture inhibit the binding of androgens to the AR, but when in mixture do not always conform to the predictive addition mixture response model. Also, high relative potencies of individual chemicals in the assay were suppressed when combined with less potent chemicals, showing that the potent chemicals may not be granted access to bind with the AR when exposed in mixture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: androgen receptor, anti-androgen, fungicides, mixtures&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>E Archer</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>JH van Wyk</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112128\">        <title>Characterisation of hydraulically-active fractures in a fractured granite aquifer</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112128</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, the practical usefulness and fundamental applicability of a self-potential (SP) method for identifying the hydraulically-active fractures were evaluated by a comparison of SP methods with other geophysical logging methods and hydraulic tests. Potentially permeable fractures intersecting a shallow, 10-m borehole were first identified using conventional geophysical methods such as acoustic borehole televiewer imaging and temperature, electrical conductivity and gamma-gamma logs. These results were then compared to results of analysis using the SP method. Constant pressure injection and recovery tests were conducted for verification of the hydraulic properties of the fractures identified by various logging methods. The acoustic borehole televiewer and gamma-gamma logs detected the openings or weathering zones associated with fractures intersecting the borehole, but they could not prove that groundwater was flowing through the detected fractures. The temperature and fluid-column electrical conductivity logs were unable to detect the fractured zones where groundwater in the borehole flows out to the surrounding rock aquifers. Comparison of results from the different methods tested showed that the most effective correlation between logs and the distribution of hydraulic conductivity was given by the SP signals, and that SP logging can accurately indicate the location of hydraulically-active permeable fractures. Based on these results, the SP method is recommended for determining the location of hydraulically-active fractures rather than other conventional geophysical logs. This self-potential method can be effectively applied in the initial stage of a site investigation to select the optimal site location or to evaluate the hydrogeological properties of fractures in underground exploration studies, such as those related geothermal reservoir evaluation and radioactive waste disposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: self-potential method, hydraulically-conductive fractures, constant pressure injection and recovery tests, underground structure&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>HB Lee</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>B Kim</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112129\">        <title>Optimum reliable operation of water distribution networks by minimising energy cost and chlorine dosage</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112129</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent decades much attention has been paid to optimal operation of water distribution networks (WDNs). In this regard, the system operation costs, including energy and disinfection chemicals, as well as system reliability should be simultaneously considered in system performance optimisation, to provide the minimum required level of performance in failure condition and to manage economic limitations. In this study, multi-objective optimisation of water distribution network performance in 3 different scenarios was considered. In these scenarios the effects of time-dependent chlorine injection and pump speed, as well as different combinations of objective functions for minimising energy and disinfection costs and for maximising hydraulic reliability and quality-based reliability are incorporated. As the optimisation method, a multi-objective ant colony optimisation (ACO) algorithm was used because of its high efficiency. For better managing the hydraulic behaviour and water quality in the WDN, considering temporal variations of demand, it is suggested to use variable speed pumps (VSP) as well as to inject chlorine at a variable rate. Application of VSP and time-dependent chlorine injection results in improvements such as reduction in energy and disinfection costs, and decrease in disinfection costs in application of HDSM (head-driven simulation method). In HDSM simulation of WDN, a decrease in hydraulic reliability because of shortages in water supply can be mitigated through extra chlorine injection and increase in quality-based reliability. To deal with this challenge, it is recommended to satisfy the hydraulic reliability first and then to evaluate the quality reliability. Furthermore it is necessary to modify the hydraulic reliability relationship to incorporate different components of the WDN other than pumps. This will provide more reliable results for evaluation of the system performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keywords&lt;/strong&gt;: multi-objective optimisation, aco algorithm, energy cost, disinfection costs, hydraulic reliability, quality reliability&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>N Babaei</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>M Tabesh</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>S Nazif</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-01-28</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-28</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>41</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112130\">        <title>Surface-complexation modelling for describing adsorption of phosphate on hydrous ferric oxide surface</title>    <link>http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/112130</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Adsorption of dissolved phosphate onto synthetic hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) was measured in the laboratory as a function of pH, ionic strength, and phosphate relative concentration.
