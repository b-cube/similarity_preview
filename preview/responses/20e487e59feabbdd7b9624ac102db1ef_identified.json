See cross reference section - this metadata file.</othercit> </citeinfo> </lworkcit> </citeinfo> </citation> <descript> <abstract> A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters, Crassostrea virginica, in North Inlet Estuary, South Carolina, USA were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously.  The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996.  Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study.  Geomorphological observations were made in four stages ranging from general to detailed: 1) a general reconnaissance and the selection of the eight creeks, 2) Chris Corbett and Leroy Humphries conducted detailed survey of the internal geomorphology of the selected eight creeks using GIS equipment, 3) Leah Gregory produced a oyster reef map and oyster biomass determination, and 4) Dennis Allen measured and classified all creek bottoms (referred to as Internal Creek Habitat Survey).  In January 1997, after the first three stages were complete, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek.  This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass.  Sampling of water and nekton began in March 1997.  In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, nekton and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume.  This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and nekton in the creeks.  During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated.  The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage.  The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. In January of 1998, the internal habitats of all eight intertidal creeks (4 in Clambank Creek, 4 in Town Creek) were surveyed manually (on foot) using tape measures during low tide.  One tape was positioned along the central axis of the creek and a shorter tape was used to determine the width of the creek bottom (from the lowest points of adjacent creek banks) perpendicular to the axis.  The widths were determined every one meter along the length of the main creek and each tributary.  A diagram depicting the methods and morphology was created and is called \"InternalCreekDiagram\".  A one-meter by one-meter PVC quadrat was used to determine the bottom type of every square meter of each creek.  Classification was based according to 16 bottom types.  Bottom sediments without living oysters were classified as soft mud, sandy mud, shelly mud, and shelly sand.  Twelve other categories were based on low-density shell, medium clusters, or dense aggregates of living oysters present on those four sediment types.  These data were used to generate percent values for proportions of the various bottom types.  When the data were analyzed along with the other creek morphological characteristics and nekton data, the internal creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two bottom types: mud and shell.  The creek bottom types were also divided up on the Nalgene field data sheets by their general location in the creek such as left or right fork, in a pool, and in a submerged area. External characteristics just outside the study creeks were also surveyed in January of 1998.  These features also may influence the nekton entrance into the intertidal creek.  Bottom types were determined for the intertidal area between the mouth of each intertidal creek and the mean low water (MLW) mark at the edge of the adjacent subtidal creek.  Whereas, the distance between the mouth and MLW varied among sites, the lateral extent of the area used for this set of bottom type analyses was defined as ten meters upstream and fifteen meters downstream of the mouths of each intertidal creek.  A diagram depicting the methods and morphology was created and is called \"ExternalCreekDiagram\".  The same procedure identified for characterizing bottom area and types inside of the intertidal creeks was used for characterizing the area outside of the mouths.  Like the internal creek categories, the external creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two. </abstract> <purpose>The CREEK Project Habitat survey was initiated in January 1998 to determine what percentage of mud, shell, and live oyster reef made up of each of the eight creek bottoms in the North Inlet Estuary system, Georgetown, South Carolina.  The Habitat types were used to help relate how and if the bottom habitat type influenced the nekton utilization of the creek.</purpose> <supplinf> &gt;              Significant Publications and Presentations: &gt; Testing the role of oyster reefs in the structure and function of tidal creeks with a replicated ecosystem scale experiment: system level variability and response to removal of oysters.

Oyster biomass data was collected to determine the natural average biomass of oysters within intertidal creeks so that all creeks could be adjusted to that average level and subsequently to monitor changes in oyster biomass since elucidating the role of oysters was the primary purpose of the overall study.  Intensive planktonic - microbial loop sampling and experiments were conducted in selected creeks at various times.  Collections of all nekton in creeks during bankfull neap tides were conducted seasonally during two years of the project, one pre-manipulation year and one post-manipulation year. Oyster growth was measured monthly during the same period of nekton collections.  Infection intensities of the oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, were made in fall of the pre-manipulation year and once following the manipulation.  See the Creek Project Overview documentation for information on publications, presentations, and other undergraduate and graduate research project topics. &gt; &gt;                       Summary of important results: Although covering 25-70% (avg.40%) of intertidal creek bottoms, oysters do not dominate faunal biomass or the remineralization of nutrients. Totally unexpected was the finding that summer nekton (fishes, shrimps, crabs) biomass is higher than oyster biomass. Nekton prefer certain creeks to others and these distributions are related to creek shape, mean depth, flooding and discharge rate, and distance to upland ridge, but not creek size (volume, area, or length). A tag / recapture study by a student found that pinfish migrated into flooding creeks but did not move among creeks. El Ni&amp;ntilde;o, a global environmental event, was clearly evident from the analysis of three years of weekly chlorophyll and nutrient data (1997-2000). Utilizing limited literature values and preliminary experiments, a simple budget for ammonium indicated that nekton inputs were considerably greater than oyster excretion as a source to intertidal creeks.

The last number in column E, 11 m2, was not included in the column E's sum of 131 m2 therefore the corrected sum is 142 m2, which includes the value of 11 m2.  Further, the sum for column L was listed as 21 m2; however, this sum does not include the value of 1 m2 (Clambank to posts before frame), therefore the corrected sum should be 22 m2.  The overall total for Creek 1 was listed as 570 m2; however, the actual values total to 568 m2.  These values were verified by the Rescue Data Manager in 2004 and were corrected in the file: FinalIntValues. Creek 2 Mud was listed as 65 m2; however the total is listed as 75 m2.  According to the Nalgene field data sheets mud should be listed as 75 m2 and not 65 m2. These values were verified by the Rescue Data Manager in 2004 and were corrected in the file: FinalExtValues. In the file, ExtValues, Creeks 1 and 4 had discrepancies and it has not been determined why they exist.

One tape was positioned along the central axis of the creek and a shorter tape was used to determine width of the creek bottom (from the lowest points of adjacent creek banks) perpendicular to the axis.  The widths were determined every one meter along the lengths of the main creek and each tributary. A one-meter by one-meter PVC quadrat was used to determine the bottom type of every square meter of each creek.  Classification was based according to 16 bottom types.  Bottom sediments without living oysters were classified as soft mud, sandy mud, shelly mud, and shelly sand.  Twelve other categories were based on low density shell, medium clusters, or dense aggregates of living oysters present on those four sediment types.  The bottom types of all eight creeks were recorded on Nalgene field data sheets. Additional internal geomorphological characteristics that were measured included: cross-sectional area at the mouth, number of branches (forks or tributaries), number of changes in direction of the creek axis that exceeded 10%, number of pools remaining at low tide, distance to next closest intertidal creek mouth, and the area of submerged bottom at low tide. External characteristics just outside the study creeks were also surveyed.  Bottom types were determined for the intertidal area between the mouth of each intertidal creek and the mean low water (MLW) mark at the edge of the adjacent subtidal creek.  Whereas, the distance between the mouth and MLW varied among sites, the lateral extent of the area used for this set of bottom type analyses was defined as ten meters upstream and fifteen meters downstream of the mouths of each intertidal creek.  The axis of this fixed 25 m dimension was perpendicular to the mouth of the intertidal creek, and the width of this area from the mouth to MLW varied from 2-9 m at the different locations.  The same procedures identified for characterizing bottom area and types inside of the intertidal creeks was used for characterizing the area outside of the mouths. See the creek diagrams that describe how the internal (file called InternalCreekDiagram) and external creek (file called ExternalCreekDiagram) and pool habitats were surveyed.  These are available on Baruch's website and also as part of the printed-out metadata (See Appendix) that resides at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory. </methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Laboratory Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Field Data Processing and Analysis The field measurement data were used to generate percent values for proportions of the various bottom types.  Some of these survey measurements were combined with the Total Station survey measurements done by Corbett, et al. (1997) to create addition-derived variables describing the geomorphology of the creeks.  When the data were analyzed along with the other creek morphological characteristics and the nekton data, the creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to two bottom types: mud and shell. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Leroy Humphries</origin> <origin>Chris Corbett</origin> <origin>Department of Marine Science, Coastal Carolina University</origin> <origin>Belle W.

The internal creek habitat categories were condensed from 16 bottom types to 2 bottom types: mud and shell.  The external creek habitat categories were originally condensed from 16 bottom types to 3 bottom types: mud, sparse-medium, and dense-reef.  For data analysis, these were later condensed to two: mud and shell. &gt;               Data Rescue Process Description:  2004 workup Data Capture and Processing of Original Raw Data Files (April 2004) Obtained original raw hardcopy Nalgene field data sheets, creek survey maps, line drawings, and internal and external habitat summary tables from PI, Dennis Allen.  The Nalgene field data sheets and other raw data were scanned and saved in the DIRECTORY: CREEKHABSURVEY.RAW. In the process folder, CREEKHABSURVEY.PROCESS, the Rescue Data Manager created MS Excel spreadsheet files from the internal and external creek original Nalgene field data sheet values.  The file, ExtValues, was created using the file, BOTTOMSURVEY.SUMMARYC1-8.1998.EXT, which was the original raw external notebook paper.  Further, all of the data was compiled into one Excel file for the internal data and one for the external data.  Internal and external graphs of the creek bottom coverage area (in square meters) data were created for all eight creeks.  In addition, two general creek diagrams were created to describe how the internal and external creek and pool habitats were surveyed. Data Verification and Creation of Final Rescued Databases (June 2004) The folder, CREEKHABSURVEY.FINAL, contains the final graphics, documentation, and verified internal and external Excel data files.  The file, FinalExtValues, was derived from the original Nalgene field data sheets that were used in the field and the file contains two spreadsheets labeled ExtIDS and FinalExtValues.  ExtIDS contains a list of symbols that were used to identify external creek bottom types on the Nalgene field data sheets.  The Data Manager used the Nalgene field data sheets to recalculate the discrepancies and the correct totals are represented in the spreadsheet, FinalExtValues.  The files: IntValues and FinalIntValues were created using the files: CREEK1A.SUMMARY.INT - CREEK8.SUMMARY.INT.  Further, the file: FinalIntValues contains two spreadsheets labeled IntIDS and FinalIntValues.  IntIDS contains a list of symbols that were used to identify the internal creek bottom types on the Nalgene field data sheets.  The Data Manager recalculated the totals on the summary sheets from the files CREEK1A.SUMMARY.INT - CREEK8.SUMMARY.INT and the correct totals are represented within the FinalIntValues spreadsheet.  Graphs of the internal and external creek bottom habitat survey were created to show the creek bottom coverage (in square meters) for all eight creeks.  The files: InternalCreekDiagram and ExternalCreekDiagram were created to depict a general internal and external creek bottom survey, respectively. </procdesc> <procdate> 20040601 </procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>North Inlet Estuary which is part of Hobcaw Barony is located in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA</indspref> <direct> Point </direct> </spdoinfo> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover> Each CREEK subproject had its own database attribute naming conventions, abbreviations, and meanings.  See each subproject's metadata for details.  However, there were some names and meanings common to the entire CREEK project. Creek = The numbering identification of each tidal creek within North Inlet Estuary where water samples were collected; creeks 1-4 were creeklets running into Clambank Creek; creeks 5-8 were creeklets running into Town Creek.  See map for creek numbering and location within North Inlet Estuary (located in the Supplemental Information). Listed below are definitions of measured and derived physical variables of intertidal creeks used in the analyses of creek hydrogeomorphology and relationships between physical features and nekton.  Bank-full elevation refers to the top of the creek banks and edge of the Spartina marsh. &gt;                                  Size Length:  length of the main creek plus tributaries.  Measurements along the centerlines of the main channel and all tributaries (from the mouths to the ends where the channel bottom rises to the bank full elevation) were summed to create this variable.  Doubling of the length values provides a measure of creek edge. Width: mean width of the main channel of the creek.  Distances between banks were measured every 10m from the mouth to the end of the main creek to determine mean width.  The measurements were made at the bank-full elevation. Depth: mean depth of the main channel.  Vertical distances between the flooded water surface (bank full level) and creek bottom were measured at the same transects used to determine mean width. Cross-section: area of the cross-section of the creek mouth.  This variable was calculated from multiple linear measurements of the vertical plane that defined the mouth of the creek.  Vertical measurements were based on bank full elevation. Bottom area: total area of bottom of all types in the main creek and all tributaries.  A survey using one meter square quadrats and tape measure generated total bottom area.  All roughly horizontal surfaces between creek banks were included. &gt;                             Variables related to tide Elevation: surveyed elevation of the creek mouth relative to the mean low water level. Volume: volume of the creek (including tributaries) at bank full tide level.  Calculations were based on survey measurements of creek length, width, and depth at bank full. &gt;                                  Landscape Drainage area: area of intertidal marsh and mudflats between the edge of the creek and the estimated furthest distance flooding waters move outward before encountering flooding waters from adjacent drainage basins.  The boundaries were estimated from high resolution aerial photographs. Location: shortest linear distance from the creek mouth to the nearest upland forest edge.  Distances were determined from high resolution aerial photographs. &gt;                                  Shape Branches: number of tributaries extending from the main creek channel. Bends: number of locations at which the axis of the main channel changes direction by more than ten degrees. Slope: slope of the regression line based on bottom elevation at 10m intervals from the mouth to the end of the main channel (where the bottom attains bank full elevation). &gt;                                  Bottom Features Roughness: irregularity of the bottom based on the coefficient of variation associated with mean depth. Pools: number of depressions (&gt;5m2) in the intertidal creek bed that hold at least 10cm of water at low tide. Submerged area: area of creek bottom (pools) covered by at least 10cm of water at low tide. Oyster area: area of creek bottom with living oysters and/or whole shell regardless of the composition of the underlying sediment.  Qualifying quadrats ranged from dense oyster reef to muddy areas with sparse clusters or shell patches. Mud area: area of creek bottom with unconsolidated sediment but without oysters.  Qualifying quadrats ranged from uniform areas of soft mud to shelly sand without whole shell.  Mud area plus oyster area equals total bottom area. Outside oyster area: area of intertidal bottom with living oysters and/or whole shell immediately outside of the creek mouth.  The area calculation was based on the distance between the center of the intertidal creek mouth and the low tide mark at the edge of the subtidal creek (width) and a standard 25m length (10m upstream and 15m downstream  from the centerline). &gt;                                  Proportions Percent bottom submerged: a ratio, submerged bottom area to (total) bottom area. Percent oyster bottom: a ratio, oyster bottom area to total bottom area. Percent outside oysters: a ratio, area of oysters outside of the creek mouth to total area outside of the creek mouth. &gt;                                  Other Ratios Conduit: a ratio: drainage area to (total) bottom area. Creeks with high ratios had large drainage areas relative to the size of the creek (as indicated by bottom area). Axial dominance: a ratio: length of the main channel axis to the cumulative total length of all tributaries. Steepness: a ratio: total volume of water at bank full level to total bottom area.  Creeks with high ratios tended to have square lateral profiles with steeper banks. Fringe: a ratio: surface area at bank full to total bottom area.  Creeks with high ratios tended to have more shallow fringing areas. Flow: a ratio: cross-sectional area at the mouth to total volume of water at bank full tide.  Creeks with high ratios tended to have large mouths relative to the volume of the creek; these creeks filled and emptied more slowly than others. Meander: a ratio: number of directional changes in the main channel axis (bends) to the length of the main channel. Split: a ratio: number of branches to the length of the main channel.
