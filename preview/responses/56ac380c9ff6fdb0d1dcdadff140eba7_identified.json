Estimates of absorbed dose rates to wildlife from exposure to natural background radionuclides are required to put estimates of dose rates arising from regulated releases of radioactivity and proposed benchmarks into context. These data are from a study conducted at seven sites in northwest England (comprising broadleaved and coniferous woodlands, scrubland and pastures). Passive track etch detectors were used to measure the Rn-222 concentrations in artificial burrows over a period of approximately one year (July 2009 to June 2010). Instrumented measurements of burrow air and soil pore gas were also conducted in October 2009.     The data result from a study funded by NERC-CEH and the England &amp; Wales Environment Agency. Details of the study and a discussion of its findings can be found in: Beresford et al. (doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.05.023). </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacky Chaplow</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radon</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>burrowing animals</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>background exposure</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cumbria</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>2008-2010</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-08-06T10:14:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1a91c7d1-ec44-4858-9af2-98d80f169bbd\">     <title>Observations of Fukushima fallout in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1a91c7d1-ec44-4858-9af2-98d80f169bbd</link>     <description>Following the Fukushima accident in March 2011, grass samples were collected from 42 sites around Great Britain during April 2011. Iodine-131 was measurable in grass samples across the country with activity concentrations ranging from 10 to 55 Bq per kg dry matter. Concentrations were similar to those reported in other European countries.  Rainwater and some foodstuffs were also analysed from a limited number of sites. Of these, I-131 was only detectable in sheep's milk (c. 2 Bq/kg). Caesium-134, which can be attributed to releases from the Fukushima reactors, was detectable in six of the grass samples (4-8 Bq/kg dry matter); 137Cs was detected in a larger number of grass samples although previous release sources (atmospheric weapons test and the 1986 Chernobyl and 1957 Windscale accidents) are likely to have contributed to this.  All data and information for this sampling are available from this record. The data result from collaboration between CEH and the University of Stirling.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>March-May 2011</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Fukushima</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Japan</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC04023</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>foodstuffs</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>I-131</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>caesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-04T15:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
