The CRMA was also active in developing the Rules and Regulations for the EEMP, which still needs to be passed into law. The USVI has recently undergone gubernatorial and senatorial elections. The new administration took office on January 2nd 2007, however, the division heads and other appointed staff are still in transition. The final report of this project will form part of a comprehensive package of information to be presented to the head of the Division of Fish and Wildlife, the senior staff of CZM, the commissioner, and key staff members of DPNR, once these officials are in place. </Abstract>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20100816000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/project/1413/NA04NMF4630334_CRMA_final_report.pdf </URL>  <project>  <ID>1413 </ID>  <title>General Coral Conservation Grants </title>  <PI>Andy Bruckner </PI>  </project>  <Region>USVI </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-64.435020 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>-65.205180 </Westbc>  <Southbc>17.543930 </Southbc>  <Northbc>18.533300 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>misc </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>Grants </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>misc </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
