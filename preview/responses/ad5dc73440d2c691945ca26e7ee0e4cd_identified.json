The indicators use EPA air quality data (from ambient air monitors) and the methodology described in the air team's indicator report. Each file contains, for each county having complete monitoring data: the year, state FIPS code (individually and combined with county FIPS), county name, county population, number of days by county above O3 benchmark (default federal NAAQS), the person-days by county above O3 benchmark (default federal NAAQS), county PM2.5 annual avarage, percent of monitored days above benchmark (default: US Federal NAAQS), and the number of person-days above benchmark (default: Federal NAAQS).</abstract> <purpose>The data are intended for use in CDC's EPHT portal for displays describing PM2.5- and O3-related air quality across the U.S. by county.

The air quality data used in calculating the O3 indicators is tested to ensure that they are 75% complete during an area's ozone season.
