Periods of onshore flow are forecast for the Pacific Northwest and northern California through Monday. Surface low development is expected across the northern or central Great Plains on Tuesday with a cold front progressing across the central and eastern U.S. by late next week. A series of low pressure systems are forecast to track across the southern Gulf of Alaska, while a surface high remains centered over northern and eastern Alaska. <br><br><u>Hazards</u> <ul><li>Heavy rain for parts of the Southeast, Sun-Mon, Mar 22-23. <li>Heavy rain and high-elevation snow for parts of northern California and Oregon, Mar 22-23. <li>Much below-normal temperatures for parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast, Sun-Tue, Mar 22-24.   <li>High winds for New England, Sun, Mar 22. <li>River flooding possible, occurring, or imminent across parts of southeast Texas, the Lower Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio Valley. <li>Slight risk of much-below normal temperatures for much of the eastern U.S., Fri-Sun, Mar 27-29. <li>Severe drought for the Central and Southern Great Plains, Southwest, Great Basin, California, the Pacific Northwest. </li></ul><u>Detailed Summary</u><br><br><a name='3-7days'> For Sunday March 22 - Thursday March 26: </a> A split-flow pattern is expected to continue across the continental U.S. through the weekend with a trough over eastern North America and a ridge extending from western Canada to Alaska. A shortwave trough in the southern stream is forecast to track along the Gulf Coast and result in heavy rain (1 to 2 inches, locally more) across parts of the Southeast on Sunday and Monday.  <br> <br>Early next week, this southern stream trough may amplify and spawn a strengthening low pressure system over the western Atlantic. The latest deterministic model runs and a majority of the GFS and ECMWF ensemble members favor a weak surface low moving away from the Southeast. However, a few ensemble members continue to indicate a stronger low pressure system with a risk of snow for the southern/central Appalachians.   <br> <br>Periodic onshore flow is forecast to bring occasional rain and high-elevation snow to the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies during this period. A potent upper-level trough is expected to bring heavy rain and high-elevation snow to coastal Oregon and northern California on Sunday and Monday. Snow levels are expected to fall as low as 3,000 feet late Monday across southwest Oregon and northern California with the passage of the upper-level trough. As this upper-level trough shifts inland, the potential exists for heavy snow across the north-central Rockies/northern Great Plains and the pattern becomes more favorable for severe thunderstorms across the central/southern Plains. However, poor model continuity precludes designation of any specific hazards with this upper-level trough for these areas at this time.  <br> <br>A strong cold front is forecast to bring much-below normal temperatures (12 degrees or more) to parts of the Great Lakes and Northeast from Sunday through Tuesday. Cold air advection is expected to promote high winds across New England on Sunday.  On Monday and Tuesday mornings, minimum temperatures are forecast to fall into the single digits across northern New England.  <br> <br>Although maximum temperatures are forecast to average more than 12 degrees above normal across much of the western U.S. during this period, these temperatures are not considered to be hazardous. Highs of around 90 degrees are likely to return to the desert Southwest on Monday. Maximum temperatures could exceed 80 degrees on Tuesday across the southern high Plains as the deterministic 6Z GFS and 0Z ECMWF models indicate 850 temperatures warming to 18 degrees C with southwest flow. The warm temperatures coupled with increasing surface winds due to a lee trough are expected to elevate wildfire danger across the central and southern high Plains early next week.   <br> <br>Recent rainfall and rapid snow melt triggered moderate flooding along the Ohio River and is likely to persist for the lower Ohio River throughout this period. Heavy rain (4 to 8 inches) during the past two weeks resulted in minor to moderate river flooding across multiple rivers across east Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Rainfall this weekend may prolong and cause additional river flooding across these areas, while minor flooding may begin along the Lower Mississippi River.  <br> <br>Light precipitation amounts are expected across Alaska as the storm track remains generally south of the state. The upper-level trough near the Aleutians and anomalous southerly flow is likely to result in above-normal temperatures across southern Alaska. <br><br><a name='8-14days' href='/products/predictions/814day/index.php'> For Friday March 27 - Thursday April 02: </a> The 6Z GFS and 0Z ECMWF ensemble means remain in good agreement during Week-2, featuring an amplified longwave pattern with an upper-level trough (ridge) over eastern (western) North America. The upper-level trough, with anomalous northerly flow results in a slight risk of much below-normal temperatures across much of the eastern U.S. early in Week-2. Freezing temperatures may extend as far south as the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast from March 27-29.  <br> <br>The most recent U.S. Drought Monitor, valid March 17, shows a very slight increase (15.73 to 16.24) in the percentage of land in severe drought (D2-D4). <br><br>Forecaster: Brad Pugh<br><br>$$<br><br>]]> </discussion></entry></item>",
