After these events, China&#8217;s forest policy underwent a significant reorientation towards ecological conservation and rural development, a process epitomized by the Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program (CCFP). Launched in 1999, the CCFP integrates both socioeconomic and environmental objectives with the aim of reforesting smallholder cropland on sloping lands, while compensating farmers with payments for their lost income. Following 15&#160;years of implementation, it is timely to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the state of knowledge about the CCFP&#8217;s impacts on human populations and the environment.Methods/designThe primary research question asks &#8220;What socioeconomic and environmental effects has the Conversion of Cropland to Forest Program had on human populations and land resources during its first 15&#160;years in China?&#8221; We use a theory of change and a Population-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome (PICO) framework to structure our systematic review, where populations of interest consist of both human populations and land resources targeted by the program, while the intervention of interest is the CCFP as defined by its component activities, including compensatory subsidies, skill-training, and enforcement with field checks. Outcomes are defined as both the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the program. We will conduct a search for relevant English and Chinese language literature on Scopus, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, AGRIS (FAO), and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Search results will be screened for relevance in a two stage process (titles and abstracts, followed by full texts) based on predefined eligibility criteria, and then further assessed for potential sources of bias. Extraction of data from those studies that have passed full-text screening will follow a coding protocol based on the PICO framework, and quantitative and qualitative analyses of the extracted data will be conducted and synthesized. Finally, a narrative report will present the findings of the review, alongside a geographic map illustrating the coverage of included studies compared with the actual implementation area of the CCFP.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/6</link>                 <dc:creator>Lucas Guti\\ufffd\\ufffdrrez Rodr\\ufffd\\ufffdguez</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Nick Hogarth</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Wen Zhou</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Louis Putzel</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Chen Xie</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kun Zhang</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:6</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-03-14T12:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/s13750-015-0033-8</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/s13750-015-0033-8-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>6</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-14T12:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>PDF</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/1\">         <title>A systematic mapping protocol: what are the impacts of different upstream business models in the agriculture and forestry sector on sustainable development in tropical developing countries?</title>         <description>Background: As a result of rising global food and energy insecurity, investors are increasingly seeking new opportunities in tropical developing countries endowed with comparatively cheap and abundant land resources. Predominantly targeting the agriculture and forestry sectors, these investments could make valuable contributions to the economies of developing countries. However, with most investors opting for plantation-oriented business models, in the context of weak governance regimes within many host countries, many fear that these investments may instead exacerbate socio-economic vulnerabilities and processes of environmental degradation. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative upstream business models that are more inclusive of the poor and are more aligned with emergent green growth objectives. This systematic map aims to contribute to this debate by cataloging empirical studies conducted on the sustainability of different upstream business models in the agriculture and forestry sector (e.g. involving the cultivation of raw materials). The mapping will offer an overview of the type and quantity of research conducted to date, remaining knowledge gaps, and areas warranting a systematic review. Methods: Searches will be conducted of both academic and grey literature by employing search strings that have been iteratively tested for comprehensiveness. Studies retrieved in the searches will be screened using pre-defined inclusion criteria and coded across a broad range of study characteristics. Inclusion criteria include, for example, type of business model employed, social, economic, and environmental impacts, and study design (e.g. generation of new empirical evidence). The outputs will be a database of included search results and a systematic map offering descriptive statistics and narrative assessment of the state of the evidence base in this topic.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/1</link>                 <dc:creator>George Schoneveld</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Filipe Di Matteo</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Frederico Brandao</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Pablo Pacheco</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Idsert Jelsma</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Eileen Jarnholt</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:1</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-03-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-4-1</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-4-1-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>1</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-10T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>PDF</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/5\">         <title>The fitness consequences of inbreeding in natural populations and their implications for species conservation &#191; a systematic map</title>         <description>Background: Threatened species often have small and isolated populations where mating among relatives can result in inbreeding depression increasing extinction risk. Effective management is hampered by a lack of syntheses summarising the magnitude of, and variation in inbreeding depression. Here we describe the nature and scope of the literature examining phenotypic/fitness consequences of inbreeding, to provide a foundation for future syntheses and management. Methods: We searched the literature for articles documenting the impact of inbreeding in natural populations. Article titles, abstracts and full-texts were assessed against a priori defined criteria, and information relating to study design, quality and other factors that may influence inbreeding responses (e.g. population size) was extracted from relevant articles. Results: The searches identified 11457 articles, of which 614 were assessed as relevant and included in the systematic map (corresponding to 703 distinct studies). Most studies (663) assessed within-population inbreeding resulting from self-fertilisation or consanguineous pairings, while 118 studies assessed among-population inbreeding due to drift load. Plants were the most studied taxon (469 studies) followed by insects (52 studies) and birds (43 studies). Most studies investigated the effects of inbreeding on components of fitness (e.g. survival or fecundity; 648 studies) but measurements were typically under laboratory/greenhouse conditions (486 studies). Observations were also often restricted to the first inbred generation (607 studies) and studies frequently lacked contextual information (e.g. population size). Conclusions: Our systematic map describes the scope and quality of the evidence describing the phenotypic consequences of inbreeding. The map reveals substantial evidence relating to inbreeding responses exists, but highlights information is still limited for some aspects, including the effects of multiple generations of inbreeding. The systematic map allowed us to define several conservation-relevant questions, where sufficient data exists to support systematic reviews, e.g. How do inbreeding responses vary with population size? However, we found that such syntheses are likely to be constrained by incomplete reporting of critical contextual information. Our systematic map employed the same rigorous literature assessment methods as systematic review, including a novel survey of study quality and thus provides a robust foundation to guide future research and syntheses seeking to inform conservation decision-making.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/5</link>                 <dc:creator>Linda Neaves</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jacqualyn Eales</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Raj Whitlock</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Peter Hollingsworth</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Terry Burke</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Andrew Pullin</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:5</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-02-26T12:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/s13750-015-0031-x</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/s13750-015-0031-x-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>5</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-02-26T12:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/4\">         <title>What are the impacts of reindeer/caribou ( Rangifer tarandus L.) on arctic and alpine vegetation? A systematic review</title>         <description>Background: The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus L.) has a natural range extending over much of Eurasia&#8217;s and North America&#8217;s arctic, alpine and boreal zones, yet its impact on vegetation is still unclear. This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Methods: Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results: Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. Conclusions: We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/4</link>                 <dc:creator>Claes Bernes</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kari Br\\ufffd\\ufffdthen</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Bruce Forbes</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>James Speed</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jon Moen</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:4</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-02-23T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/s13750-014-0030-3</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/s13750-014-0030-3-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>4</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-02-23T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/3\">         <title>What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review protocol</title>         <description>Background: There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60&#160;years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/3</link>                 <dc:creator>Magnus Land</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Cynthia de Wit</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ian Cousins</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Dorte Herzke</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jana Johansson</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jonathan Martin</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:3</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-27T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-4-3</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-4-3-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>3</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-27T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/2\">         <title>What are `Integrated Landscape Approaches&#191; and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol</title>         <description>Background: There is an increasing acceptance that sectorial approaches to land management are no longer sufficient to meet global challenges such as poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and food production. The pressing challenge of integrated landscape management is to link agricultural practices, institutions and policies with other landscape-scale activities. &#8220;Integrated Landscape Approaches&#8221; provide a basic framework for balancing competing demands and integrating policies for multiple land uses within a given area. However, attempts to formalize and characterize what landscape approaches actually represent have resulted in a plethora of interlinked terminology and re-invention of ideas and practices under multiple guises. This has led to delayed uptake amongst policy makers and resistance to implementation on the ground. This protocol will describe the methodology to be employed for a systematic map that will chart the development of the landscape approach theory, consolidate and synthesize existing definitions, and identify where and how these approaches have been implemented in the humid and dry tropics.Methods/DesignA scoping exercise gave rise to a selection of search terms appropriate to the research question which will then be applied to a suite of specialist, online and institutional databases. The protocol will follow a population-intervention-comparator-outcome (P.I.C.O) framework which provides the basic rationale for evidence-based systematic literature searches. The P.I.C.O serves as the inclusion criteria and together with a pre-determined exclusion criteria will be used to screen retrieved literature for relevance at title, abstract and full text levels. All studies investigating either landscape approach theory or implementation within the humid and dry tropics will be included. The resulting studies will be coded and used to satisfy two key outcomes. First, literature on the theory of landscape-scale approaches will be compared and contrasted to identify where overlap and disjuncture exists. Second, studies of landscape approach implementation will be assessed for effectiveness, geographically mapped, made available in searchable databases and supplemented with a full report.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/2</link>                 <dc:creator>James Reed</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Liz Deakin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Terry Sunderland</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:2</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-4-2</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-4-2-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>2</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-07T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/26\">         <title>What are the local impacts of energy systems on marine ecosystem services: a systematic map protocol</title>         <description>Background: Increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHG) and its impact on the climate has resulted in many international governments committing to reduce their GHG emissions. The UK, for example, has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 80% by 2050. Suggested ways of reaching such a target are to increase dependency on offshore wind, offshore gas and nuclear. It is not clear, however, how the construction, operation and decommissioning of these energy systems will impact marine ecosystem services, i.e. the services obtained by people from the natural environment such as food provisioning, climate regulation and cultural inspiration.Research on ecosystem service impacts associated with offshore energy technologies is still in its infancy. The objective of this review is to bolster the evidence base by firstly, recording and describing the impacts of energy technologies at the marine ecosystems and human level in a consistent and transparent way; secondly, to translate these ecosystem and human impacts into ecosystem service impacts by using a framework to ensure consistency and comparability. The output of this process will be an objective synthesis of ecosystem service impacts comprehensive enough to cover different types of energy under the same analysis and to assist in informing how the provision of ecosystem services will change under different energy provisioning scenarios. Methods: Relevant studies will be sourced using publication databases and selected using a set of selection criteria including the identification of: (i) relevant subject populations such as marine and coastal species, marine habitat types and the general public; (ii) relevant exposure types including offshore wind farms, offshore oil and gas platforms and offshore structures connected with nuclear; (iii) relevant outcomes including changes in species structure and diversity; changes in benthic, demersal and pelagic habitats; and changes in cultural services. The impacts will be synthesised and described using a systematic map. To translate these findings into ecosystem service impacts, the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) and Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) frameworks are used and a detailed description of the steps taken provided to ensure transparency and replicability.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/26</link>                 <dc:creator>Eleni Papathanasopoulou</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ana Queir\\ufffd\\ufffds</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Nicola Beaumont</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Tara Hooper</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Joana Nunes</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2014, null:26</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-12-16T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-3-26</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-3-26-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>26</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-16T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/25\">         <title>The impact of land use and cover change on above and below-ground carbon stocks of the miombo woodlands since the 1950s: a systematic review protocol</title>         <description>Background: Increasingly, forests are on the international climate change agenda as land use and cover changes drive forest and carbon loss. The ability of forests to store carbon has created programs such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation plus (REDD+), in order to provide incentives for particular land uses and forest management practices. A critical element to REDD+&#8201;is the ability to know the carbon-storage potential of an ecosystem, and the factors likely to affect the rate of carbon accumulation or the maximum amount stored. Most REDD+&#8201;initiatives have focused on humid tropical forests because of their large stocks per unit area. Less attention has been paid to the carbon-storage potential of tropical dry forests, woodlands and savannas. Although these ecosystems support a lower biomass per unit area, they are more widespread than humid forests. This proposed systematic review examines miombo woodlands, which are the most extensive vegetation formation in Africa and support over 100 million people. We ask: To what extent have changes in land use and land cover influenced above- and below-ground carbon stocks of miombo woodlands since the 1950s? Methods: We will search systematically for studies that document the influence of land use and cover change on above and below ground carbon in miombo woodlands since the 1950s. We will consult bibliographic databases and an extensive grey literature network, including government reports and forestry offices. Relevant studies will examine the impacts of human activities, fire and other land use or cover changes that affect wood biomass or soil carbon in the miombo region. All included studies will be assessed for the soundness and scientific validity of their study design. A quantitative synthesis will tabulate estimates of various parameters necessary to assess carbon stocks and changes across climate and geological factors; and a qualitative analysis will describe the governing land and forest policies. Understanding the impact that land uses and the associated changes have on carbon storage in the miombo woodlands will contribute to more informed forest management policies and better guided strategies for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/25</link>                 <dc:creator>Stephen Syampungani</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jessica Clendenning</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Davison Gumbo</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Robert Nasi</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kaala Moombe</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Paxie Chirwa</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Natasha Ribeiro</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Isla Grundy</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Nalukui Matakala</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Christopher Martius</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Moka Kaliwile</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Gillian Kabwe</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Gillian Petrokofsky</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2014, null:25</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-12-05T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-3-25</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-3-25-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>25</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-05T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/24\">         <title>What are the socio-economic impacts of genetically modified crops worldwide? A systematic map protocol</title>         <description>Background: Genetically modified (GM) crops have generated a great deal of controversy. Since commercially introduced to farmers in 1996, the global area cultivated with GM crops has increased 94-fold. The rapid adoption of GM technology has had substantial socio-economic impacts which a vast amount of technical and non-technical literature has addressed in the last two decades. However, contradictory results between individual studies abound. Extensive and transparent reviews concerning this contentious and complex issue could help promote evidence-based dialogue among the diverse parties involved. Methods: This protocol specifies the methodology for identifying, evaluating, and mapping evidence related to the main review question: what are the socio-economic impacts of genetically modified crops worldwide? This question has been subdivided into the following topics: (a) farm-level impacts; (b) impacts of coexistence regulations; (c) impacts along the supply chain; (d) consumer-level impacts; (e) impacts on food security; and (f) environmental economic impacts. The search strategy includes the identification of primary studies from general scientific databases; global, regional, and national specialist databases; an on-line search engine; institutional websites; journal websites; subject experts/researchers; and serendipity. Searches will be conducted in six languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish). Identified studies will be screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria by a group of multi-language reviewers. Finally, pre-defined data from the studies will be extracted, mapped, and presented in a report. Potential research gaps will be identified and discussed, and the review process will be documented in an open-access database (i.e. CADIMA, http://www.cadima.info/).</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/24</link>                 <dc:creator>Jaqueline Garcia-Yi</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Tiptunya Lapikanonth</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Hanum Vionita</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Hanh Vu</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Shuang Yang</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Yating Zhong</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Yifei Li</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Veronika Nagelschneider</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Birgid Schlindwein</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Justus Wesseler</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2014, null:24</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-12-02T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-3-24</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-3-24-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>24</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-02T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/23\">         <title>Investigating the effects of mobile bottom fishing on benthic biota: a systematic review protocol</title>         <description>Background: Mobile bottom fishing, such as trawling and dredging, is the most widespread direct human impact on marine benthic systems. Knowledge of the impacts of different gear types on different habitats, the species most sensitive to impacts and the potential for habitats to recover are often needed to inform implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries and strategies for biodiversity conservation. This knowledge helps to identify management options that maximise fisheries yield whilst minimising negative impacts on benthic systems.Methods/designThe methods are designed to identify and collate evidence from experimental studies (e.g. before/after, control/impact) and comparative studies (spanning a gradient of fishing intensity) to identify changes in state (numbers, biomass, diversity etc.) of benthic biota (flora and fauna), resulting from a variety of mobile bottom fishing scenarios. The primary research question that the outputs will be used to address is: &#8220;to what extent does a given intensity of bottom fishing affect the abundance and/or diversity of benthic biota?&#8221; Due to the variety of gear and habitat types studied, the primary question will be closely linked with secondary questions. These include: &#8220;how does the effect of bottom fishing on various benthic biota metrics (species, faunal type, trait, taxon etc.) vary with (1) gear type and (2) habitat, and (3) gear type-habitat interactions?&#8221; and (4) &#8220;how might properties of the community and environment affect the resilience (and recovery potential) of a community to bottom fishing?&#8221;</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/23</link>                 <dc:creator>Kathryn Hughes</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Michel Kaiser</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Simon Jennings</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Robert McConnaughey</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Roland Pitcher</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ray Hilborn</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ricardo Amoroso</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jeremy Collie</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jan Hiddink</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ana Parma</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Adriaan Rijnsdorp</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2014, null:23</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-11-25T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-3-23</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-3-23-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>23</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-25T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <cc:License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#Reproduction\" />         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#Distribution\" />         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#DerivativeWorks\" />     </cc:License> </rdf:RDF> ",
