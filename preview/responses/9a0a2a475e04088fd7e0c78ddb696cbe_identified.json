The primary IFSAR dataset was acquired by Intermap Technologies and contracted by the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Science Foundation. The raw data were collected with a STAR-3i airborne synthetic aperture radar system, a high-resolution, single pass, across track IfSAR system (Intermap, 2010). The Digital Surface Model (DSM) products represent the first reflective surface as illuminated by the radar.  The STAR-3i system is capable of acquiring imagery with a horizontal accuracy better than 2 m, a vertical accuracy better than 1 m, and a vertical resolution on the order of 0.1 m (Intermap, 2010).  Accuracy statements are based on areas of moderate terrain. Diminished accuracies are to be expected in areas of extreme terrain and dense vegetation.  In addition, the DSM contains processing artifacts expressing as 30 to 50 cm high ripples or 'corn rows' that should be considered additional vertical error in the dataset.  This striping results from uncompensated differential phase errors on very flat terrain.  In addition, users will notice a seam line separating the tiles that were provided in UTM zone 5 with those provided in UTM zone 4. The differences along the seamline is within the 1m vertical accuracy of the dataset butthe variability is apparent here.   The DSM data for 7.5-minute by 18-minute units correspond to the USGS 1:63,360 scale topographic quadrangle map series for available areas in the United States.  Each 7.5-minute by 18-minute tile provides full coverage with overlap into adjacent tiles.  The mosaic consists of 312 tiles.  The mosaic was created using the software package Global Mapper and exported as an Erdas Imagine image file.  The IFSAR tiles comprising the mosaic consist of bara1nw, bara1se, bara1sw, bara2ne, bara2nw, bara2nw, bara2se, bara2sw, bara2sw, bara3ne, bara3nw, bara3nw, bara3se, bara3se, bara3sw, bara3sw, bara4ne, bara4ne, bara4nw, bara4nw, bara4se, bara4se, bara4sw, bara4sw, bara5ne, bara5ne, bara5se, bara5se, bara5sw, bara5sw, barb3se, barb3se, barb3sw, barb3sw, barb4ne, barb4ne, barb4se, barb4se, barb4sw, barb4sw, hara2nw, hara2sw, hara3ne, hara3nw, hara3se, hara3sw, hara4ne, hara4nw, hara4se, hara4sw, hara5ne, hara5nw, hara5se, hara5sw, harb2nw, harb2sw, harb3ne, harb3nw, harb3se, harb3sw, harb4ne, harb4nw, harb4se, harb4sw, harb5ne, harb5nw, harb5se, harb5sw, harc3sw, harc4nw, harc4se, harc4sw, harc5ne, harc5nw, harc5se, harc5sw, hard4sw, hard5ne, hard5nw, hard5se, hard5sw, ikpc1ne, ikpc1nw, ikpc1se, ikpc1sw, ikpc2ne, ikpc2nw, ikpc2se, ikpc2sw, ikpc3ne, ikpc3nw, ikpc3se, ikpc3sw, ikpc4ne, ikpc4nw, ikpc4se, ikpc4sw, ikpd1ne, ikpd1nw, ikpd1se, ikpd1sw, ikpd2ne, ikpd2nw, ikpd2se, ikpd2sw, ikpd3ne, ikpd3nw, ikpd3se, ikpd3sw, ikpd4ne, ikpd4nw, ikpd4se, ikpd4sw, ikpd5ne, ikpd5nw, ikpd5se, ikpd5sw, ikrc5ne, ikrc5nw, ikrc5se, ikrc5sw, lord1ne, lord1nw, lord1se, lord1sw, lord2ne, lord2nw, lord2se, lord2sw, lord3ne, lord3nw, lord3se, lord3sw, lord4se, lord4sw, mera1ne, mera1nw, mera1se, mera1sw, mera2ne, mera2nw, mera2se, mera2sw, lord4nw, lord4ne, mera3ne, mera3nw, mera3se, mera3sw, mera4ne, mera4nw, mera4se, mera4sw, merb1ne, merb1nw, merb1se, merb1sw, merb2ne, merb2nw, merb2se, merb2sw, merb3ne, merb3nw, merb3se, merb3sw, merb4ne, merb4nw, merb4se, merb4sw, merc1ne, merc1nw, merc1se, merc1sw, merc2ne, merc2nw, merc2se, merc2sw, merc3ne, merc3nw, merc3se, merc3sw, merc4ne, merc4nw, merc4se, merc4sw, merd1ne, merd1ne, merd1nw, merd1nw, merd1se, merd1sw, merd2ne, merd2ne, merd2nw, merd2nw, merd2se, merd2sw, merd3ne, merd3ne, merd3nw, merd3nw, merd3se, merd3sw, merd4se, merd4sw, tesa1ne, tesa1nw, tesa1se, tesa1sw, tesa2ne, tesa2nw, tesa2se, tesa2sw, tesa3ne, tesa3nw, tesa3se, tesa3sw, tesa4ne, tesa4nw, tesa4se, tesa4sw, tesa5ne, tesa5nw, tesa5se, tesa5sw, tesb1ne, tesb1nw, tesb1se, tesb1sw, tesb2ne, tesb2nw, tesb2se, tesb2sw, tesb3ne, tesb3nw, tesb3se, tesb3sw, tesb4ne, tesb4nw, tesb4se, tesb4sw, tesb5ne, tesb5nw, tesb5se, tesb5sw, tesc1ne, tesc1nw, tesc1se, tesc1sw, tesc2ne, tesc2nw, tesc2se, tesc2sw, tesc3ne, tesc3nw, tesc3se, tesc3sw, tesc4ne, tesc4nw, tesc4se, tesc4sw, tesc5ne, tesc5nw, tesc5se, tesc5sw, tesd1ne, tesd1nw, tesd1se, tesd1sw, tesd2ne, tesd2nw, tesd2se, tesd2sw, tesd3nw, tesd3se, tesd3sw, tesd4ne, tesd4nw, tesd4se, tesd4sw, tesd5ne, tesd5ne, tesd5nw, tesd5nw, tesd5se, tesd5sw, umic3ne, umic3nw, umic3se, umic3sw, umic4ne, umic4nw, umic4se, umic4sw, umic5se, umic5sw, umic5ne, umic5nw, umid2nw, umid2sw, umid3ne, umid3nw, umid3se, umid3sw, umid4ne, umid4nw, umid4se, umid4sw, umid5ne, umid5nw, umid5se, and umid5sw. </abstract> <purpose>This dataset has been developed in order to create a lake-based polygon vector layer for the Western Arctic Coastal Plain in northern Alaska and to analyze lakes by landscape drainage gradients that exist around the lake periphery.</purpose> <supplinf> The STAR-3i system employs three principle technologies: X-band Horizontal -Horizontal (HH) polarized SAR, a ring laser-based inertial measurement unit (IMU), and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS). STAR-3i was developed by the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan (ERIM) under contract to the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).   The system is comprised of two X-band radar antennae that collect data simultaneously. The set of acquired data are \"interfered\" by a digital correlation process to extract terrain height data and geometrically correct radar images. STAR-3i uses post-processed DGPS data, together with precise inertial measurement data, to attain highly accurate positioning control. Precise terrain height and positioning data are enhanced by careful calibration of the baseline separating the two antennae.   The STAR-3i system accuracy has been independently validated by tests conducted by the U.S. Army Topographic Engineering Center, the Institute of Navigation, Stuttgart University and by NASA. </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20020724</begdate> <enddate>20060913</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Imagery Acquisition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-159.022997</westbc> <eastbc>-150.128969</eastbc> <northbc>71.555322</northbc> <southbc>69.235925</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>User</themekt> <themekey>Digital Elevation Model</themekey> <themekey>Digital Surface Model</themekey> <themekey>IFSAR</themekey> <themekey>Surface Elevation</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>elevation</themekey> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Alaska</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>It is strongly recommended that careful attention be paid to the contents of the metadata file associated with these data to evaluate data set limitations, restrictions or intended use.

Due to the method used to create the DSM and the interaction of the SAR signal with surface water features, a technique known as hydrologic enforcement has been used to ensure that rivers flow downhill and that lakes and ponds have flat surfaces.  Thus, the DSM is a product that underwent a fair bit of hydrological manipulation during post-processing.  For lakes, this typically means that the water is flattened to the average elevation of the lake coast as defined by the DSM using the water edge visible in the orthorectified radar image (ORRI).  Given that X-band SAR was used to acquire the DSM data, information on the true surface elevation of the lakes is received (albeit with noise and decorrelation and being dependent on surface roughness of the water).  During the post-processing phase, lakes were leveled to constant elevation using the survey information acquired during data collection.  In addition, all lake levels were checked to ensure that they were at least 0.1m below the surrounding land surface. </attraccr> </attracc> <logic>QA/QC completed by Originator.</logic> <complete>The DSM covers large portions of the following USGS quads: Barrow, Meade River, Teshekpuk, and Harrison Bay.
