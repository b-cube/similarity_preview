This is a speech composed by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> on behalf of a plaintiff (whose name we do not know) who is suing his brother-in-law, <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name>. The particulars of the case are these: <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>, an Athenian citizen, has wed his two daughters to two men; the older daughter was married to the plaintiff and the younger daughter to a man named <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>. The plaintiff, in addition to receiving the woman to wed, was also to receive a dowry of 40 minae (see also <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>). At the time of the wedding, he was to receive 30 minae with an agreement that the remaining ten will be paid to him upon <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>&#8217; death. <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>, the plaintiff&#8217;s new brother-in-law, signed on as the guarantor of this agreement. In the course of time, however, <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name> had a falling-out with his father-in-law. He divorced his wife and cut all ties with his ex-wife&#8217;s family. <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>&#8217; daughter was soon remarried to a man by the name of <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name>. But, after <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name> left, <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> did not have the money available to cover the additional 10 minae that he owed to the plaintiff. He solved this problem by mortgaging his house to the plaintiff only five days before his death (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.18\">Dem. 41.18</bibl>); according to <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.5\">Dem. 41.5</bibl>, the arrangement appears to be that the plaintiff would collect any money made by the estate of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> in the form of rents, debts paid, etc. The money that was collected would be used to pay off the debt of 10 minae that was still owed the plaintiff. The mortgage, however, would not be necessary if <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name> would simply pay the money that he owes the estate of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>. The plaintiff is suing <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name> on behalf of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>&#8217; widow and daughter for money that <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name> owed to <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>. This includes: 1) half a mina to cover funeral expenses for <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>, 2) eighteen minae that <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name> borrowed from <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>&#8217; widow, 3) two minae for a slave that <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name> <soCalled>bought</soCalled> from <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> but never paid for, and 4) certain material goods including a bowl, some jewelry, and some hangings, which <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name> later pawned (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.11\">Dem. 41.11</bibl>). With the money that the estate would receive from <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name>, the plaintiff could be paid and <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>&#8217; house could be taken out of mortgage. According to the plaintiff, all of these matters have already been brought to arbitration (<foreign lang=\"grc\">pro\\\\s tw=| diaithth=|</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.12\">Dem. 41.12</bibl>; also <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.28\">Dem. 41.28</bibl>) without a satisfactory conclusion. The plaintiff wants to make it clear that Spudias is of no account and that legal action was forced upon him because of <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name>&#8217; stubbornness. The speech is generally agreed to be an early work of <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> (perhaps before <date value=\"-355\">355 BCE</date>) (source for date: <bibl>A.T. Murray, <title>Demosthenes II</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 3</bibl>). Interestingly, archaeologists have found an inscription mentioning <quote><name type=\"person\">Kleiokrateia</name>, daughter of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> of <name type=\"person\">Teithras</name>, and wife of <name type=\"person\">Spudias</name></quote> in the Athenian <placeName key=\"agora\">agora</placeName> (see <bibl><title>Hesperia</title>, vi. [1937], pg. 341</bibl>).</p> <byline>Christopher Cotten</byline> </div0>   </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
