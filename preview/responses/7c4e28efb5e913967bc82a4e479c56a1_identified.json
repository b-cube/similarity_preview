This study is part of a comprehensive program to develop protocols for the assessment of biological diversity and integrity in the Park Complex.  Results in this report are derived from pitfall traps, randomly placed among 9 selected habitats sampled during four monthly periods (June- October) during 1995.  Five of these habitats were re-sampled during the same periods in 1996.  Nearly 16,000 adult arthropods representing 448 species of beetles, spiders, ants, and true bugs were captured from 529 pitfall trap samples over the two years of the study.  Species accumulation curves, combining two years of sample effort, did not reach asymptotes for most habitats.  Accumulation curves using several species richness estimators also indicated that the true species richness remains unknown.  Comparisons of species richness estimators at a standard level of effort revealed that the greatest richness was found in willow/carex swamp habitat.  Alder swamp habitat consistently exhibited the highest diversity in a comparison of values from three diversity indices.  Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) classification of sites by species reduced the original 9 habitats, sampled in 1995, into 6 groups.  Separation of habitats into the various groups was based largely upon the distributions of 10 species.  TWINSPAN analysis was also completed for the 5 re-sampled habitats, using combined data from 1995 and 1996, resulted in similar groupings of habitats and similar indicator species.  Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) ordinations of arthropod data also produced distinct habitat groupings consistent with TWINSPAN results.  NMDS analysis revealed a strong gradient in percent canopy cover along Axis 1, and weaker gradients with soil moisture, coarse woody debris, and percent herbaceous plant cover along Axes 1 and 2.  Gravel bars were a very distinct group separated from all the other groups along Axis 2.  TWINSPAN analysis also showed strong separation of gravel bars from other habitats.  Using the Indicator Value index (IV) (Dufrene and Legendre 1997),  36 potential indicator species were recognized for the 6 TWINSPAN habitat groups.  TWINSPAN only identified 10 indicator species, and some site groups were only defined by the absence of a particular indicator.  Recommendations for design and implementation of future structured inventory and monitoring programs using arthropods are discussed.</abstract> <purpose>Specific objectives were to characterize arthropod community assemblages, identify environmental factors that influence community assemblage structure, and to provide basic information useful in the design and implementation of future monitoring programs.</purpose> <supplinf>This report represents last of a series of five technical reports on our efforts to document arthropod occurrence, abundance, and habitat associations in the Big Beaver Creek Research Natural Area of North Cascades National Park Complex (NOCA), located in northwestern Washington. The first four reports document occurrence, life history information, and information concerning taxonomy of species from four major arthropod groups including the Heteroptera (Hemiptera), Coleoptera, Arachnida (Araneae), and Hymenoptera (Formicidae).  Individuals from these groups largely represent ground dwelling taxa and accounted for over 70% of the total of all specimens collected by pitfall traps in the study area.  This final report utilizes concepts from statistical and community ecology to classify habitats based on their arthropod assemblages, to describe structural and functional characteristics of these assemblages, and to identify environmental factors that influence the structure of these assemblages.  This report also provides information and  recommendations for development of future arthropod monitoring programs in the park.</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>1995</begdate> <begtime>Unknown</begtime> <enddate>1996</enddate> <endtime>Unknown</endtime> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <descgeog>North Cascades National Park Service Complex - Big Beaver Creek.</descgeog> <bounding> <westbc>-121.19045</westbc> <eastbc>-121.06881</eastbc> <northbc>48.81588</northbc> <southbc>48.77487</southbc> <elevmin>494</elevmin> <elevmax>579</elevmax> <altunits>meters</altunits> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>Arthropod</themekey> <themekey>riparian</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>North Cascades National Park Service Complex</placekey> <placekey>Big Beaver Creek</placekey> <placekey>Pacific Northwest</placekey> <placekey>USA</placekey> <placekey>Washington</placekey> </place> <temporal> <tempkt>None</tempkt> <tempkey>1995</tempkey> <tempkey>1996</tempkey> </temporal> </keywords> <taxonomy> <taxonsys> <classsys> <classcit> <citation> <citeinfo> <title>various taxa experts listed in Literature Cited section</title> </citeinfo> </citation> </classcit> </classsys> <taxonpro>Various taxa experts identified the Arthropod species collected during this study.

TWINSPAN simultaneously classifies species and samples.  The resulting hierarchy of groups can be shown on a dendrogram with the species that influence division of groups of sample sites.  A more detailed description of the method is found in Gauch (1982, pp. 201-203).

Pitfall trapping is a well-established method for sampling ground-active arthropods, with extensive literature dealing with the protocols and limitations of this technique (e.g.Greenslade 1964, Luff 1975, Uetz and Unzicker 1976, Adis 1979, Topping and Sunderland 1992, Spence and Niemela 1994, Mommertz et al. 1996).  Pitfall traps selectively sample surface-active arthropods (versus litter-dwelling or arboreal species) and therefore does not provide direct unbiased measures of abundance.   There has been discussion over the utility of pitfall traps for estimation of population abundance in entomological literature.  However, there is general agreement that pitfall traps are useful for comparing relative abundance of invertebrate species among sites (Adis 1979, Southwood 1978, Luff and Eyre 1988).  All species are not equally susceptible to this sampling method.  For example, pitfall traps preferentially capture large, active species.  Pitfall capture rates are also a function of climatic conditions, since these affect arthropod activity.  For instance, very cold or dry conditions often result in reduced catches since many arthropods are less active under these circumstances.  A further complication is that pitfalls sampling over relatively long periods may strongly attract necrophagous (carrion-feeding) insects (e.g. blowflies and burying beetles), especially traps that incidentally capture vertebrates and those with dilute preservative.  There is also evidence that ethylene glycol, a standard preservative used in pitfall sampling, actively attracts some species or genders of insects (Holopainen 1990).  No such evidence exists regarding the preservative used in the Big Beaver Creek study, propylene glycol, but it seems likely that it would have similar effects.  The pitfall traps consisted of a plastic bucket 18 cm tall with a diameter of 14 cm at the top and 12 cm at the bottom.  An aluminum funnel was placed inside the top to prevent arthropods from escaping.  This funnel extended about 8 cm down into the bucket with a bottom opening of 3 to 4 cm and the top tightly wedged inside and near the rim of the bucket.  A 16 oz plastic cup, filled with approximately 100 ml of propylene glycol (non-toxic antifreeze), was placed inside the bucket.  The plastic buckets were set into the ground so that the top of the bucket was even with the level of the surrounding substrate.  Backfill and litter were repositioned to approximate the original condition of the trapsite.  The cup, containing the antifreeze was set inside the bucket and then the funnel was installed.  Finally, a 2 x 25 x 25 cm wooden board supported by 2 x 2 x 5 cm legs was set over the pitfall trap to exclude debris and rain.  Ten separate habitat patches were randomly selected for each habitat type and one pitfall trap was used per habit patch, with the exception of bog and gravel bar sites in 1995.  There were only two patches of the bog habitat in the valley.  Five pitfall traps were placed at each of these sites.  For gravel bar sites, 11 separate patches were selected in 1995 and 10 in 1996.  Traps operated continuously throughout the sampling period, from early June through October of 1995 and 1996.  The 1995 sample effort also included May.  Extensive bear damage to these early season traps, up to 70% of the traps, made it necessary to drop this sample period from analyses and exclude it from the 1996 data.  Thus, 91 traps were utilized in 1995 and 50 in 1996.  In order to reduce \"trap-out\" effects and individual trap bias, each 1996 trap position was shifted approximately 10 m from the 1995 position.  Extensive habitat information from an 8 &#xD7; 8 m grid centered upon the trap was recorded for the area immediately surrounding each trap site.  Information collected for each site included UTM coordinates, elevation, crude soil type (e.g. clay versus loam), soil moisture categories during August, litter depth, percent canopy closure (densiometer), slope, aspect, percent herb and shrub cover by species (herb and shrub cover was measured in 4x4 m plots centered upon the trap), tree species inventory (number of individuals and d.b.h.) and coarse woody debris inventory.  The number and species of vertebrates collected by the pitfalls were also recorded, and all such specimens were retained.   Pitfall samples were collected once a month.  Specimens collected from each trap were placed in bottles with the antifreeze preservative and returned to the lab for processing.  In the laboratory, samples were washed, and sorted, and all specimens were placed in vials of 70% ethanol.  All identifications were based on intact adult specimens and were identified, in most cases to the species level.  Taxonomic references and expertise used in the identification of specimens from the four major groups of arthropods (true bugs, spiders, ants, and beetles) were reported in Parts I-IV of this series (see Lattin 1997, LaBonte 1998, and Glesne 1998, 2000).</methdesc> </method> <method> <methodid> <methkt>None</methkt> <methkey>Data Analysis</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc>Species Richness and Diversity  Species richness and diversity analyses for each habitat were developed from data matrices representing the number of captures for each species by individual samples. For example, during 1995 gravel bar habitats were sampled with 11 pitfall traps during each of the four monthly sample periods, capturing 96 species, resulting in a matrix of 96 columns (species) and 44 rows (samples).  These analyses were completed for each of the nine habitats sampled in 1995 and for the combined 1995 and 1996 set of samples from the 5 habitats sampled during both years.    EstimateS 5.0.1 (Colwell 1997) software was used for the analyses.  Accumulation curves for all parameters were developed by computing mean values for each sample increment from 100 randomizations of sample order.  This sample analysis procedure is discussed in more detail in Colwell and Coddington (1994).  The following describes species richness estimators and diversity indexes used in the analyses: The Chao1 estimator (Chao 1984, Colwell and Coddington 1994, Colwell 1997), The Chao2 estimator (Chao 1987, Colwell and Coddington 1994, Colwell 1997), Jackknife1, the first-order jackknife estimator of species richness (Burnham and Overton 1978, 1979; Heltshe and Forrester 1983, Colwell 1997), The Shannon diversity index (H' - see Magurran 1988, Hayek and Buzas 1996), The Alpha index (a - Fisher's alpha diversity index), Simpson's index (D) (Magurran 1988),    Classification and Ordination  Data Reduction and Matrix Development: Species by site data matrices for classification and ordination analyses represented a reduced version of the original data set.  First, because rare species may distort these analyses (see, Gauch 1982, Faith and Norris 1989, Jackson 1993), all species with less than 6 individuals total were dropped from the analysis.  Vagrant species (those with very limited distributions among all the sample sites - species found at three or fewer sites) were also dropped.  Next, matrix values for final analyses were calculated by taking monthly averages of capture data for each species from each trap.   Finally, investigation of outliers in the dataset was completed using PC-ORD ver. 3.0 software (McCune and Mefford 1997).  An outlier is a sample of peculiar species composition and has low similarity to all other samples.  Many multivariate methods give unsatisfactory results if outliers are present (Gauch 1982).  For this study, outlier analysis of sample sites by species composition used the Sorenson distance measure.    TWINSPAN (Hill 1979, Gauch and Whittaker 1981) is considered a polythetic divisive classification technique, which uses information from all species, and where all samples are successively divided into smaller and smaller clusters until finally each cluster forms some specified smaller number of clusters (Gauch 1982).  TWINSPAN simultaneously classifies species and samples.  The resulting hierarchy of groups can be shown on a dendrogram with the species that influence division of groups of sample sites.  A more detailed description of the method is found in Gauch (1982, pp. 201-203).  Certain limitations of TWINSPAN have been reported by van Groenewoud (1992) and by Belbin and McDonald (1993).    TWINSPAN analysis was performed, using PC-ORD ver. 3.0 software (McCune and Mefford 1997), on the following four datasets: 1) 1995 data only for nine habitats, using all species (data matrix representing 116 species and 85 sample plots, following data reduction as previously mentioned); 2) 1995 beetle data for the nine habitat types (data matrix representing 86 species and 85 sample plots); 3) 1995 spider data for the nine habitat types (data matrix representing 14 species and 85 sample plots); and, 4) Combined 1995 and 1996 data for the five re-sampled habitats, using all species (data matrix representing 101 species and 94 sample plots).  There were not enough species of ants and true bugs to apply TWINSPAN analysis to these groups.   PC-ORD parameter options used in the TWINSPAN analyses included: minimum group size for division = 5, maximum number of indicators per group = 5, and maximum levels of divisions = 3.  Pseudospecies cut levels were set at 0, 2, 5, 10, and 20 individuals.   Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)  The purpose of NMDS is to provide a visual representation of the patterns of similarity among individual samples as determined by the composition of their arthropod assemblages.  Sites in close proximity to each other exhibit greater similarity in species composition than sites located farther apart in the ordination diagrams.  This method, as with other ordination methods, simplifies large amounts of ecological information to allow a greater understanding of the structure of communities and relationships with corresponding environmental characteristics and conditions.    In NMDS, raw data is first converted into a matrix of dissimilarity values.  Unlike metric forms of ordination, NMDS only uses the rank order information from the dissimilarities matrix.  The intention with the non-metric method is to moderate the often violated assumption of linearity (change in value of one variable is directly proportional to the change in value of another) in the data with a weaker and less problematic assumption of monotonicity (paired variables must increase together, or as one increases the other must not decrease) (Gauch 1982).   Pimentel (1995) reviews the advantages and limitations of both metric and non-metric ordination methods.    Given only the compositional dissimilarities among sites, the ordination space is derived such that the resulting distances in the ordination space match (exhibit a low 'stress' value) the corresponding dissimilarities.  The stress measure is defined according to a prescribed relationship between dissimilarities and distances (see Kruskal 1964a).  Stress values are used to examine the goodness of fit between the similarities and final fit.  Kruskal (1964a) gives informal interpretation of stress values where; &lt; 5% is excellent, 5-10% is good, 10-20% is fair, and &gt;20% is poor.  Kruskal (1964b) and Pimentel (1995) give detailed explanations of the NMDS method.    NMDS analysis was performed, using PC-ORD ver. 3.0 software (McCune and Mefford 1997), on the 1995 data set for nine habitats, using all species (data matrix representing 116 species and 85 sample plots), and the combined 1995 and 1996 data set for the five re-sampled habitats, using all species (data matrix representing 101 species and 94 sample plots).  The coordinates graph file from a Principal Components Analysis (PCA, PC-ORD ver. 3.0 software) of the data matrices was used as the starting coordinates for the NMDS ordinations.  The Sorensen distance measure (same as for the outlier analysis) was used to construct the dissimilarity matrix.  The NMDS procedure was completed requesting information for both 2 and 3 axes.  Although analyses using the third axis reduced stress values, it was not a significant reduction, and it was thought that most of the information in the data set could be represented by 2 axes.   Site Attribute Correlations  Spearman rank correlations were used to measure the association between site attributes (soil moisture, soil type, vegetation composition, tree basal area, canopy cover, litter depth, and coarse woody debris), as well as with the NMDS ordination axes values.  The latter indicates environmental factors that influence the grouping of sites in the NMDS ordination space.  SPSS ver. 9.0 software (SPSS 1999) was used for obtaining Spearman rank correlation values.     Indicator Species Analysis  Dufrene and Legendre (1997) proposed the use of a species Indicator Value index for identifying indicator species and species assemblages characterizing groups of sites.  The index is based on only within-species abundance (% relative abundance) and occurrence (% frequency of occurrence) comparisons, without any comparison among species.  The index reaches its maximum (100) when all individuals of a species are found in a single habitat type and when the species occurs in all sites of that habitat type.  PC-ORD ver. 3.0 software (McCune and Mefford 1997) was used to calculate Relative abundance (RA), Relative Frequency (RF), and Indicator Values (IV) for important taxa (IV value &gt; 40) by TWINSPAN groups ordinated from data collected during 1995.</methdesc> <methcit> <citeinfo> <origin>Chao, A</origin> <pubdate>1984</pubdate> <title>Non-parametric estimation of the number of classes in a population</title> <pubinfo> <publish>Scandinavian Journal of Statistics 11:265-270</publish> </pubinfo> </citeinfo> </methcit> <methcit> <citeinfo> <origin>Colwell, R.K</origin> <pubdate>1997</pubdate> <title>EstimateS: Statistical estimation of species richness and shared species from samples</title> <onlink>Users guide and application published at http: //viceroy.eeb.uconn.edu/estimates</onlink> </citeinfo> </methcit> <methcit> <citeinfo> <origin>Collwell, R.K., and J.A.
