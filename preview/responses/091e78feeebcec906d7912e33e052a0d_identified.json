The rainfall estimates are derived from the Met Office national database of observed precipitation. To derive the estimates, monthly and daily (when complete month available) precipitation totals from the UK rain gauge network are used. The natural neighbour interpolation methodology, including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall, was used to generate the daily and monthly estimates. The estimated rainfall on a given day refers to the rainfall amount precipitated in 24 hours between 9am on that day until 9am on the following day.  The CEH-GEAR dataset has been developed according to the guidance provided in BS 7843-4:2012.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Daily</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>monthly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Precipitation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>areal rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>raingauge</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-06-19T09:24:49Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/b7cfc0ce-304a-4d69-bb1a-6fd8eb92cdae\">     <title>Rainfall, throughfall and stemflow for Beech and Ash stands in temperate English deciduous woodlands</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/b7cfc0ce-304a-4d69-bb1a-6fd8eb92cdae</link>     <description>Water quality data produced from rainfall, throughfall and stemflow samples collected within a beech stand at Black Wood in Hampshire, and an ash stand at Old Pond Close in Northamptonshire. Two studies were carried out in the early 1990s to examine water quality in relation to hydrological and pollution changes. Chemical analysis involved a combination of electrometric (pH), inductively-coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (most major, minor and trace elements), atomic absorption spectroscopy (potassium), ion chromatography (major anions and fluorine) and colourimetry (ammonium and silicon).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacky Chaplow</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Analytical chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>River</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>throughfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>stemflow</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>1990</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>1991</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>1992</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-06-06T08:23:30Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/68f4a12f-740d-4705-9c27-6a7fb7127046\">     <title>Vyrnwy research catchment hydrochemistry</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/68f4a12f-740d-4705-9c27-6a7fb7127046</link>     <description>This dataset includes weekly data from monitoring of stream, rainfall and groundwater hydrochemistry in the Vyrnwy research catchment between 1994 and 2001.

The data are uncensored and provide a basis for research purposes, and must be viewed in this light. Information on analytical methodologies is also available, including detection limits, from which the user can choose how the data might be interpreted.  The basins studied were the Tweed, Wear, Humber, Great Ouse and Thames. One tributary (the Teviot) and two main-stem sites were monitored in the Tweed Catchment. One site around two-thirds down the catchment of the River Wear was monitored. Humber Basin Monitoring was undertaken for all the tributaries especially near their downstream limits. The Great Ouse was monitored around half way down the catchment. The Thames catchment was monitored upstream and downstream of sewage inputs to the river, prior and post effluent stripping of phosphorus.  This work formed part of a major UK initiative introduced in the early 1990s, the Land Ocean Interaction Study, LOIS, to examine water, chemical and sediment fluxes from the eastern UK rivers to the North Sea. As part of this and subsequent work, the initiative was extended to examine a range of catchment basins, from rural to agricultural and industrial/urban impacted ones.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacky Chaplow</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Analytical chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>River</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-09-03T08:26:33Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
