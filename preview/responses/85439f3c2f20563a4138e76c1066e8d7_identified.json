The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996.  Based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected for the study.  In January 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume in each creek.  This stage of the project is referred to as the \"pre-manipulation\" period where all creeks have the same amount of oyster biomass.  Sampling of water and nekton began in March 1997.  In February 1998, about one year after the first set of water quality, chemistry, biota, and other measurements were made, living oysters were removed from four of the eight creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8), resulting in zero dry body weight per cubic meter of water at bank full volume.  This was done to investigate the role of oyster reefs in controlling levels of dissolved and particulate materials in the water and to evaluate relationships between living oysters and other ecological parameters in the creeks.  During the year following oyster removal, all measurements made in the first year were repeated.  The second year of the project during which four of the creeks were without oyster biomass was known as the \"manipulation\" stage.  The BACI analysis was used to compare data between the two years. In the tidal creeks of North Inlet Estuary, the Eastern oyster C. virginica is an abundant component of the benthic macrofauna that exerts controls on microbial communities by its grazing and nutrient regenerative activities.  During the CREEK Microzooplankton project, the effects of oyster activity on North Inlet's microbial food web structure were studied using:  (1) water samples collected from tidal creeks with oyster reefs versus tidal creeks without oyster reefs and (2) flow-through flumes.  In pair-wise comparisons of creeks with similar hydrography and morphology, the only microbial group found to vary significantly with the presence of oyster reefs was the phototrophic nanoflagellates (pflags), which were 1.25- to 2.25-fold less abundant in creeks with oyster reefs during the summer phytoplankton bloom.  Because heterotrophic nanoflagellates (hflags) did not vary in these same comparisons, we hypothesized that preferential feeding for pflags by oysters was responsible for the reduction in pflag abundance.  The hypothesis was tested during March and July 1999 using flumes with flowing creek water containing either live oysters or dead oyster shells.  Significant reductions in pflags and some types of diatoms were measured in the outflow from live oysters, but oyster effects on other microbial components (hflags, cyanobacteria, and heterotrophic bacterioplankton) were not evident.  The flume study demonstrated preferential feeding by oysters on pflags using naturally occurring microbial assemblages. The differences in pflag abundance in creeks with oyster reefs versus creeks without oyster reefs suggests that this grazing activity can affect the structure of natural microbial communities. </abstract> <purpose>The CREEK Microzooplankton Subproject was initiated in March 1997 to determine the effects of oyster grazing on microbial communities in the eight creeks in the North Inlet Estuary system, Georgetown, South Carolina.</purpose> <supplinf> Significant Publications and Presentations: Impact of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica on microbial community structure in a salt marsh estuary.

Presented by R. Dame. Other Creek Datasets Several other datasets were collected over varying periods during the four years.  Oyster biomass data was collected to determine the natural average biomass of oysters within intertidal creeks so that all creeks could be adjusted to that average level and subsequently to monitor changes in oyster biomass since elucidating the role of oysters was the primary purpose of the overall study.  Intensive planktonic - microbial loop sampling and experiments were conducted in selected creeks at various times.  Collections of all nekton in creeks during bankfull neap tides were conducted seasonally during two years of the project, one pre-manipulation year and one post-manipulation year. Oyster growth was measured monthly during the same period of nekton collections.  Infection intensities of the oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, were made in fall of the pre-manipulation year and once following the manipulation.  See the Creek Project Overview documentation for information on publications, presentations, and other undergraduate and graduate research project topics. Summary of important results: The phototrophic nanoflagellates (pflags) were found to vary significantly with the presence of oyster reefs which were 1.25- to 2.25-fold less abundant in creeks with oyster reefs during the summer phytoplankton bloom.  The flume study demonstrated and confirmed preferential feeding by oysters on pflags. Although covering 25-70% (avg.40%) of intertidal creek bottoms, oysters do not dominate faunal biomass or the remineralization of nutrients. Totally unexpected was the finding that summer nekton (fishes, shrimps, crabs) biomass is higher than oyster biomass. Nekton prefer certain creeks to others and these distributions are related to creek shape, mean depth, flooding and discharge rate, and distance to upland ridge, but not creek size (volume, area, or length). A tag / recapture study by a student found that pinfish migrated into flooding creeks but did not move among creeks. El Ni&amp;ntilde;o, a global environmental event, was clearly evident from the analysis of three years of weekly chlorophyll and nutrient data (1997-2000). Utilizing limited literature values and preliminary experiments, a simple budget for ammonium indicated that nekton inputs were considerably greater than oyster excretion as a source to intertidal creeks.

(2000) for details.  Replicate water samples for the present study were collected on 19 March, 17 July, and 29 August 1997 (in the pre-manipulation year), and monthly from March through September 1998 (first post-manipulation year), from the mouth of the 8 tidal creeks in the early afternoon at mid-ebb tide.  In the other creeks where oyster reefs were removed (Creeks 1, 4, and 8), oyster biomass remained substantially less than in the creeks where oysters were left intact (D. Bushek unpublished manuscript), (Please see web data: http://links.baruch.sc.edu/Data/CREEK/CreekOysterBiomass/CreekOysterBiomass.htm).  Water was collected in acid-cleaned 1-liter polycarbonate bottles at a depth of 1 meter from the surface.  Samples were then transported to the field laboratory and processed within 1 hour of collection.  Also, as part of the CREEK monitoring program, water samples were collected weekly from these same sites during mid-ebb tide.  These latter samples were collected at various times of day, and only those collected in the afternoon are included here for comparative purposes. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Richard Dame</origin> <origin>David Bushek</origin> <origin>Dennis Allen</origin> <origin>Leah Gregory</origin> <origin>Don Edwards</origin> <origin>Alan Lewitus</origin> <origin>Sarah Crawford</origin> <origin>Eric Koepfler</origin> <origin>Bjorn Kjerfve</origin> <origin>Theo Prins</origin> <origin>Chris Corbett</origin> <origin>Department of Marine Science, Coastal Carolina University</origin> <origin>Belle W.

NH4 concentration was determined by automated colorimetric analysis using Technicon AutoAnalyzers.  Chlorophyll was extracted in 90% acetone, using a freeze-thaw method adapted from Glover &amp; Morris (1979).  Chl a concentrations were determined fluorometrically, using a Sequoia-Turner model 450 fluorometer with NB440 excitation and SC665 emission filters.  Ciliates were preserved in 3% Lugol's solution and enumerated using the Uterm&#xF6;hl settling chamber method (Lund et al. 1958).  Depending on the date collected, 50 or 100 ml of sample was allowed to settle for ca. 1.5 h.  Ciliates were enumerated at a magnification of 300&amp;times;.  For pflag or hflag abundance, 1% glutaraldehyde-fixed samples were stained with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), following Porter &amp; Feig (1980), pulled onto a 2.0 &amp;micro;m black polycarbonate filter, and examined using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope (model BX50F) at a magnification of 600&amp;times;.  Phototrophs and heterotrophs were differentiated by alternating between ultraviolet (DAPI fluorescence of DNA) and blue excitation (pigment autofluorescence).  Duplicate ciliate and flagellate samples were counted for each data point from the 1997 study, while triplicate samples were counted for each data point from the 1998 study.  Differences between paired creeks were tested for significance using t-tests at the 5% confidence level. On selected dates, water collected during the monitoring program also was used in bioassay experiments to test the response of phytoplankton biomass (i.e. chl a) to a dilution treatment designed to reduce microzooplankton grazing pressure (Lewitus et al. 1998, modified from Landry &amp; Hassett 1982). Triplicate water samples from each creek were dispensed into acid cleaned 1-liter polycarbonate bottles and incubated in raceways containing flowing estuarine water. Overhead fluorescent cool white bulbs provided uniform irradiance (116 &amp;micro;E m-2 s-1) adjusted to a light:dark cycle simulating natural conditions (12 h light:12 h dark to 14 h light:10 h dark, depending on sampling date). Water samples were mechanically stirred at uniform rates (200 rpm) between bottles, using low speed AC motors with motor-post spindles driving a small paddle positioned at mid-bottle height.  The flasks were time-course sampled (24, 48, and 72 h) for chl a concentrations.  The 'dilution effect' was defined as the fractional change in chl a over 72 h in the whole water treatment subtracted from that in the dilution treatment (see Lewitus et al. 1998). </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>H.E.

Unfiltered seawater was drawn into the flumes via a pipe from Oyster Landing, a tidal creek in North Inlet. The water temperature and salinity during the experiments were 13&#xB0;C and 34 psu respectively in March, and 28&#xB0;C and 30 psu respectively in July.  Valves on the intake pipe allowed regulation of current velocity in the flumes.  Baffles were placed ca. 0.5 m from the intake valves in order to evenly distribute flow to the sample area.  Flume 1 contained ca. 325 oyster shells alone, with no live oysters, covering an area of 0.34 m2 and served as a control that accounted for phytoplankton settling due to oyster shell surface area.  Flume 2 was the experimental flume, containing ca. 340 live oysters.  The average oyster length was 56.3 &amp;plusmn; 15.4 mm in March and 53.3 &amp;plusmn; 18.4 mm in July.  Oyster biomass was determined non-destructively using the allometric equation found in Dame (1972) and is presented as shell-free dry body weight.  For each trial, the average biomass was 207 gdb m-2.  The biomass of oysters in North Inlet tidal creeks generally ranges from 200 to 250 gdb m-2 (Dame 1979, Dame &amp; Libes 1993).  Live oysters and dead shells were scrubbed several days before the experiments in order to remove attached organisms.  Oysters were starved for 12 hour prior to sampling.  Water flow was started at high tide, with a current velocity of 10 cm s-1.  The first samples were taken 1 hour after high tide, and subsequent samples were collected every hour until 1 h prior to low tide, for a total of 5 sampling times.  Immediately preceding each sampling time, water velocity was adjusted to correspond roughly to the in situ velocity at that tidal stage.  Velocities were measured using a Marsh-Mcbirney portable water current meter (model 201D).  Velocities starting with the first sampling time were 10, 20, 25, 15, and 10 cm s-1, which are similar to those found in North Inlet tidal creeks over an ebbing tide cycle (Dame et. al 1985, 1992). </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>R.F.

Duplicate ciliate and flagellate samples counts from 1997 and triplicate samples for 1998 were entered by hand into MS Excel spreadsheets from the hardcopy microscope counting sheets.  Likewise, the triplicate samples that were collected from each flume, at sites before and after passage over the oyster reefs were entered into MS Excel.  Data were visually inspected for entry errors.  Means and standard deviations were created by formulas written in the MS Excel spreadsheet. Data Rescue Process Description:  2004 workup. Data Capture and Processing of Final Data Files and Documentation (August 2004). Raw and final digital data were obtained from the author, Michael Wetz.  The original raw digital data files called, FieldCiliates, FieldFlagellate, FlumeChl, FlumeFlagellates, and FlumeNH4, contain triplicate count data, means, and standard deviations for heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, chlorophyll a, and NH4.  There were two summary final databases that were obtained from the PI. One was called, CreekMicrozpkData, which contains means and standard deviations from replicated field collections for heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates, and ciliates.  The other final digital database, called WetzFlumeSummary, contains the means and standard deviations from the flume data for heterotrophic and phototrophic nanoflagellates, ciliates, chlorophyll a, and NH4.  The documentation of this metadata record came from the following manuscript: Impact of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica on microbial community structure in a salt marsh estuary. (Wetz, M.S., Lewitus, A.J., Koepfler, E.T., and K. Hayes.) Aquatic Microbial Ecology. May 16, 2002. Vol. 28: 87-97. Data Verification and Creation of Final Rescued Databases (September 2004). The Data Rescue Manager did not have hard copy hand written notes to verify the triplicate database for errors.  However, the final summary digital files, CreekMicrozpkData and WetzFlumeSummary were verified using the raw digital replicated data files.  The final summary digital file, CreekMicrozpkData that was obtained from the PI was modified and used to create the rescued/published graphics; this modified version was named Final.CreekMicrozpkData.  The data documentation (this metadata record) was drafted by Baruch's Data Rescue team and was edited and verified by the author, Michael Wetz. Data Archival of Final Rescued Databases (December 2004). All final documentation, graphics, and data were printed out in hardcopy and placed into the CREEK Project's 3-ring binder; the digital version of the final products are also kept on Baruch's Web Site.  The 3-ring binder and the web site are maintained at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory (BMFL) in Georgetown, SC.  Also, all of the rescue products for the Microzooplankton database were copied to Compact Disk; one set of the CDs are kept with the hardcopy printouts and the other set is kept in the fireproof cabinet in the Data Manager's Office at the BMFL.  The entire rescue project is also archived on the BMFL's Rescue Server's Hard Drive. </procdesc> <procdate> 20041001 </procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>North Inlet Estuary which is part of Hobcaw Barony is located in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA</indspref> <direct> Point </direct> </spdoinfo> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover> Each CREEK subproject had its own database attribute naming conventions, abbreviations, and meanings.
