This article considers the lyric poetry of Sophie Mereau in the context of that critical debate, pointing up parallels (and contrasts) with the work of other writers, female and male. Reciprocity is examined here both as a contextual issue and a motif in Mereau\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work, and the article highlights the intellectual independence with which she treats themes which were \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdin the air\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd around 1800. This is the accepted manuscript.

Its main body, however, is comprised of three substantial chapters prosecuting two interlinked arguments: (1) that Der Tod in Venedig and Joseph und seine Br\\ufffd\\ufffdder are fantastic narratives and (2) that the fantastic in these narratives works hand in glove with Mann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds philosophical concerns.&#13; In order to demonstrate that the first of these propositions is correct chapter II is devoted to showing how much Der Tod in Venedig has in common with works which are acknowledged to be part of the fantastic genre (as defined by Todorov and refined by Brooke-Rose): \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Black Cat\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Turn of the Screw\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDer Sandmann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. This chapter also attempts a hermeneutics of the fantastic by discussing each of the above mentioned stories in relation to morality, meaning and intention. Attempts to dismiss the putatively supernatural elements in Der Tod in Venedig are considered in the light of the critical debate as to whether \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Turn of the Screw\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd should be considered a ghost story or just an account of hysterical hallucinations. This chapter also broaches the topic of the relationship between the metaphysical and the supernatural.&#13; Chapter III is an investigation of the meaning of Der Tod in Venedig in the light of Mann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds philosophical development. The question of whether he is more properly to be regarded as a Nietzschean or Schopenhauerian is raised, as is the influence of each on Mann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds earlier (i.e. pre-Tod in Venedig) fiction. It is suggested that neither of these philosophers could provide Mann with the sense of purpose vital to his literary creativity, and that he began casting around for an alternative to Nietzsche\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds value-free naturalism and Schopenhauer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds value-free metaphysics. Two candidates are proposed: Plato (elements of whose philosophy Mann adopts without irony) and Schiller (as a synthesis of Platonism and Kantianism). Schiller\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds interpretation of the contrast between a metaphysics of value on the one hand and a natural world with its own claims to respect on the other is advanced as the model for the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGeist/Natur\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd distinction which lies at the heart of Mann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds world-view. Mann, it is argued, having begun to apprehend the deficiencies of both Nietzsche and Schopenhauer while not yet fully embracing the Schillerian categories he would later make his own, includes putatively supernatural elements in Der Tod in Venedig which can be understood both in terms of Schopenhauer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWille\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and also in terms of a Platonic empyrean, so that it seems that two different metaphysical systems compete for space with one another. However, a Schillerian solution \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd involving the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSpieltrieb \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to this apparently unsatisfactory situation is at hand.&#13; Chapter IV deals with Joseph, and it follows the analytic procedure established in the previous two chapters. Firstly it demonstrates that there are good reasons to suspect the presence of the supernatural in this novel. Secondly, it establishes the meaning of the supernatural by considering the philosophical background alluded to by the novel\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds events and commentary. Numerous examples of the putatively supernatural are considered, as is the ubiquity of something that looks like providence throughout the tetralogy, and various naturalistic critiques are evaluated. The Schopenhauerian interpretation of the novel is discussed in the light of Mann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds 1937 essay on this philosopher, and is shown to be insufficient to explain the work as a whole. The importance of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGeist\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is emphasized. Complementing the proto-Christianity which has always been acknowledged as playing a role in Joseph a proto-Platonism is proposed as one of the novel\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds main preoccupations, and the metaphysic behind the supernatural in Joseph is shown to be as Platonic as it is Christian. However, a certain Hegelianism (which Mann understands in a dualistic fashion) at work in Joseph suggests that direct access to a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGeist\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd outside of the secular world (which is what Joseph apparently has) lacks the validity and staying-power of a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGeist\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd realized through earthly struggle. This, the thesis suggests, is the reason that Juda rather than Joseph receives Jacob\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds blessing. </summary> <dc:date>2011-10-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Arthur Schnitzler and Jakob Wassermann: a struggle of German-Jewish identities</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245043\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Haberich, Max</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245043</id> <updated>2013-10-24T10:40:52Z</updated> <published>2013-07-09T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Arthur Schnitzler and Jakob Wassermann: a struggle of German-Jewish identities Haberich, Max The purpose of this dissertation is to contrast the differing responses to early political anti-&#13; Semitism by Arthur Schnitzler and Jakob Wassermann. By drawing on Schnitzler\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds primary&#13; material, it becomes clear that he identified with certain characters in Der Weg ins Freie and&#13; Professor Bernhardi. Having established this, it is possible to trace the development of&#13; Schnitzler\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds stance on the so-called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdJewish Question\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: a concept one may term enlightened&#13; apolitical individualism. Enlightened for Schnitzler\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds rejection of Jewish orthodoxy,&#13; apolitical because he always remained strongly averse to politics in general, and individualism&#13; because Schnitzler felt there was no general solution to the Jewish problem, only one for&#13; every individual. For him, this was mainly an ethical, not a political issue; and he defends his&#13; individualist position in Professor Bernhardi.&#13; Wassermann\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds approach is entirely different. In the early stages of his literary career, he&#13; attempted to prove his authenticity as a German author by writing \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdVolksromane\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of&#13; Franconia. In the course of the First World War, he began to identify more strongly with his&#13; Jewish side. Already before the war, Wassermann had developed the notion of the Orientale,&#13; inspired by Nietzsche\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbermensch\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: a charismatic leader of Jewish origin who would&#13; eventually reconcile the German and Jewish cultures. In the 1920\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds, this figure was infused&#13; with elements of Christian and Jewish belief, notably self-sacrifice for one\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds fellow man.&#13; Like Nietzsche, Wassermann offers a primarily aesthetic solution to a cultural, social, and&#13; political problem. This fusion of traditional and modern elements is representative for literary&#13; modernism as a whole, which cannot be categorised simply as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdprogressive\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdconservative\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.&#13; Comparing Schnitzler and Wassermann yields fascinating and rewarding results, as each&#13; author provides a unique perspective on the highly complex question of Jewish identity in&#13; Vienna in the early-20th century.

Traditionally, literature on the Kirchenkampf has taken a simplistic \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgood-versus-evil\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd approach to the conflict and, arguably inspired by a moral need to come to terms with the less-than-glorious past of the German Protestant Church, has been unable to locate the Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdintact\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd churches neatly within the conventional historiographical paradigm.&#13; By taking as its subject Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe August Marahrens of Hanover, Hans Meiser of Bavaria and Theophil Wurm of W\\ufffd\\ufffdrttemberg, this dissertation examines the contribution to the Kirchenkampf of three men, who, to ensure the continued existence of German Protestantism in the Third Reich, were ultimately forced to find ways to respond to National Socialism that lay somewhere between the parameters of defiance and compliance. In order to demonstrate the collective contribution of the Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe to maintaining the status of the German Protestant Church amidst heightening Nazi tyranny, this dissertation traces how, with reference to external personal, political and socio-cultural conditions, the bishops moved from a seeming commonality of cause to display increasingly varied responses to the manifestations of both political and ecclesiastical National Socialism. By tracing the development of their moderate but nonetheless disparate positions, this dissertation not only questions the traditional historiographical assumptions that Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe Marahrens, Meiser and Wurm failed to resist National Socialism effectively or were, at best, collectively neutral in the conflict, but also seeks to delineate, for the first time, the crucial parts played by each of the Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe during three distinct stages of the Kirchenkampf.&#13; In devoting each of its three central chapters to a particular phase in the conflict, this dissertation demonstrates how each of the Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe in turn steered the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdintact\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ensemble through the Third Reich as a modest yet effective force of opposition to Nazi despotism. Seen as a whole, this investigation ultimately demonstrates how, through their respective turns at national Church leadership, Landesbisch\\ufffd\\ufffdfe Marahrens, Meiser and Wurm did not undermine the wider Church resistance effort but, rather, saved the Church from subjugation to Nazism more effectively than would have been possible had they stood alone. </summary> <dc:date>2011-10-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
