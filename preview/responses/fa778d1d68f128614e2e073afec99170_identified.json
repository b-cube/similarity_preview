In the first place, to extend the time-series of data on higher leavers originally collected in 1962, 1970, and 1972, by including 1976 leavers. Secondly the survey was designed to extend the range of topics covered by previous surveys, and for the sample to cover a broader range of leavers, and thus to include not only O-grade presentees but also 'non-certificate' pupils. A further aim was to collect data for analyses of local topics of interest to collaborators. Ie the data should be able to support studies of particular areas, subjects, types of institution or jobs, and so on.  Major variable categories include: survey administration, demographic variables, H and O subjects, academic history and results, attitudes to schooling, study habits, discipline, reasons for leaving, work, recreational facilities, further education. </summary> <dc:date>2014-07-22T14:58:01Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>1979 national school leavers survey</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/571\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/571</id> <updated>2015-03-17T11:42:59Z</updated> <published>2014-07-22T14:57:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">1979 national school leavers survey The 1979 survey covered young people who had left school in the session&#13; 1977/78. It was based on a smaller sample than the earlier 1977 survey:&#13; 10 per cent of 0 and H grade leavers, and 20 per cent of non-qualified *&#13; leavers, compared with a sample of 40 per cent of all leavers in 1977.&#13; The questionnaires were based on those used in 1977, and repeated most of&#13; the earlier items. Several new questions were added and others were&#13; revised, and the non-qualified leavers' questionnaire was substantially&#13; re-designed to include extra items on job-seeking, early employment experience&#13; and the Youth Opportunities Programme. In this way the 1979 survey has&#13; extended and updated the time series in the Scottish Education Data&#13; Archive. It also had four more specific objectives: (i) to obtain information on additional topics (covered&#13; by the new questions);&#13; (ii) to obtain information on non-Certificate leavers in&#13; Regions where they were not surveyed in 1977; &#13; (iii) to obtain information on changes between 1977 and 1979&#13; with respect to the items common to both surveys;&#13; (iv) to provide contextual information for analyses which&#13; require large sample numbers and which will therefore&#13; need to be conducted on the 1977 data.&#13;  THIS VERSION OF THE DATA FILES CONTAIN NO WEIGHT VARIABLES. </summary> <dc:date>2014-07-22T14:57:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
