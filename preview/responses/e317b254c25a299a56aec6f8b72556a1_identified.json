Copyright law differs between countries. The second aim was to depict the Israeli scene and determine which aspects relating to copyright law, if any, are taken into account in Israeli digitization projects.&#13; Objectives To reach the aims the following objectives were set out: to undertake a systematic review of the literature in two fields: copyright issues related to unpublished material \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which could be the subject of digitization projects that can potentially be made available via the Internet, and archival theory \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd outreach and access; to identify a framework as a basis for determining best practice; to identify Israeli copyright law with regard to the digitization of unpublished material; and to establishing current practice in digitization projects in Israel in relation to copyright.&#13; Methods A Policy Delphi was conducted to reach all factors pertaining to copyright and outreach and access when making a decision whether to digitize. And Israeli case studies were researched to glean information about Israeli practice.&#13; Results The outcomes of the research were: a comprehensive list of factors pertaining to copyright that is a potential basis for creating archival guidelines. And varying case studies that give a partial picture of Israeli practice.&#13; Conclusions The Delphi results can constitute a framework for developing international and national archival guidelines. The Israeli setting is a varied one and further case studies should be studied to give a fuller picture. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Perceptions of access and exclusion in the Information Society</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13983\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Anoush</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13983</id> <updated>2015-01-07T16:01:39Z</updated> <published>2005-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Perceptions of access and exclusion in the Information Society Anoush Mia; Kate This paper outlines research into women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds perceptions of social and technological change, within the contexts information society theory, and feminist analyses of gender and technology.

Widespread hyperbole surrounding new technologies such as the Internet may result in a sense of imperative to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdget connected\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or risk being left behind. However, some women also expressed sceptical attitudes toward such pressures, placing the apparent inevitability and value of new technologies in the local contexts of everyday life. </summary> <dc:date>2005-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Women's perceptions of technological change in the information society</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13948\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Simon, Anoush</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13948</id> <updated>2014-08-07T21:19:53Z</updated> <published>2006-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Women's perceptions of technological change in the information society Simon, Anoush Purpose \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The purpose of this paper is to present the findings of empirical research and focus on specific aspects of the data that relate to the concept of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdinformation rich and information poor\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

However, significantly less research has been published which focuses on UK-based users or on \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdonline-to-offline\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd friendships: relationships which begin online and move offline, becoming incorporated into participants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd everyday social circles. This study contributes to the literature in these under-researched areas.&#13; The study used a mixed-methods research design: an online questionnaire provided data which facilitated the purposeful selection of participants for face-to-face interviews. Although both quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection and analysis, the emphasis of the research is qualitative. Much of the current research into online interaction and friendship has been limited by the use of quantitative methods (Amichai-Hamburger, Kingsbury &amp; Schneider, 2013). The qualitative focus of this research resulted in rich and deep data about participants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experiences of online friendship.&#13; The results show that a significant majority of participants had made new friends on the Internet, and that online communities such as LiveJournal are more likely to foster new friendships than social networking sites such as Facebook. It was clear that online friendships are evaluated and measured in the same way as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtraditional\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd friendships. The migration of online friends into offline, everyday social circles was widely reported, suggesting that it is a frequent occurrence among the wider user population. Additionally, the migration of offline friends into online social networks was described by a number of participants, illustrating the use of online social networks to maintain and sustain offline, everyday friendships. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
