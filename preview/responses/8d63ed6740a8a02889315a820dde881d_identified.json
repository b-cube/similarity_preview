Professor Chao Han Liu (Center for Sustainability Science, Academia Sinica), speaking during a panel discussion on Future Earth at the Conference said that many answers are needed from Asia and the Pacific<span> on the question of global sustainability</span>. Alternatives needed to be sought to the currently energy and material intensive approach to development practised by industrialised countries. In addition research are needed on tipping points arising from albedo changes in the Tibetan Plateau, on transformations of the ENSO trigering mechanism, and on transformations occurring with the Indian Monsoon and on the thawing of the Siberian permafrost and release of greenhouse gasses. According to a recent publication permafrost covers 24 percent of the land surface of the Northern Hemisphere and significant thawing could affect vast areas and release billions of tons of carbon. This has huge implications for ecosystems in the region. Other speakers on the panel highlighted the need fo a new form of science that was more transdisciplinary in character. Professor Supakorn Chinvanno of the Southeast Asia Start Regional Center in Bangkok stressed the need for regional scale research that was holistic and a paradigm shift was required to design appropriate research frameworks on these issues. The theme of the SCA's Annual Conference and General Assembly in 2014 will be Future Earth: Research for global sustainability and a holistic understanding of sustainable development in Asia. The Conference will be held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>International Research Collaboration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global sustainability research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Earth system science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Science communication</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global environmental change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scientific Associates</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Applied science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Science for Policy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Regional Offices</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-05-13T03:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/our-members/scientific-associates\">     <title>Scientific Associates</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/our-members/scientific-associates</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Scientific Associates support the objectives of ICSU and uphold the principle of the Universality of Science.
