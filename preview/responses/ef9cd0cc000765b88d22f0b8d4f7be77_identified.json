However, this field has thus far failed to fully consider subjective (and subject-forming) dimensions of urban environ- mental struggle. I argue that this can be overcome through bringing urban political ecology into conver- sation with both post-structural political ecology and critical geopolitics. Bridging these literatures focuses attention on practices of socio-ecological exclusion and attachment through which environmen- tal subjectivities are formed. This argument is drawn out through a case study of the politics of local eco- nomic development and conservation within the watershed of the Big Darby Creek near Columbus, Ohio. This struggle was driven by a preservationist movement that coalesced around a shared understanding of socio-ecological hybridity as a source of metaphysical insecurity. Hybridity appears here as a site of polit- ical and ethical struggle over social and ecological exclusions produced in the pursuit of security. This case study demonstrates a paradox of environmental politics: the non-human is at once a site of constit- uent possibilities for identity and subjectivity as well as forces which seek to foreclose this radical open- ness. Recognizing the paradoxical nature of environmental struggle allows for a more complex and nuanced account of the multifarious forces that shape the formation of environmental subjectivities. </description> <dc:date>2009-03-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11400\"> <title>From Emergency Management to Managing Emergence : A Genealogy of Disaster Management in Jamaica.</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11400</link> <description>From Emergency Management to Managing Emergence : A Genealogy of Disaster Management in Jamaica. Grove, Kevin Jon The common narrative in disaster studies positions the field\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds paradigm shift from postevent response to preevent mitigation as a progressive development in knowledge on how to reduce disasters\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd impacts on public safety, human welfare, and development. Although the incorporation of participatory methods and vulnerability analysis has undoubtedly made valuable contributions to reducing human suffering, these techniques continue the biopolitics of disaster management that early critiques of hazards studies identified three decades ago. This article adopts an analytics of assemblage to analyze the topological transformations in disaster management that sustain its will to truth even as the elements comprising disaster management\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfor example, bodies, institutions, techniques, strategies, and rationalities\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdare reconfigured into assemblages of disaster mitigation. Through a genealogy of Jamaican disaster management, I show how participatory and mitigation techniques were deterritorialized from marginalized experiences of disaster and reterritorialized into mitigation policies through the confluence of local disaster events and the global emergence of sustainable development and resilience theory. Rather than offering new forms of empowerment and security from unpredictable change, institutionalized disaster mitigation articulates disaster preparedness with sustainability\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds calculative foresight and resilience theory\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds visions of life as an emergent socioecological system to extend logistical orderings of life to the everyday socioecological metabolisms that make up daily existence. Institutionalized mitigation enacts a new series of power relations through an immunitary logic that problematizes adaptability as the source of, and solution to, the threat that disasters pose to neoliberal order. </description> <dc:date>2012-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11401\"> <title>Preempting the next disaster : Catastrophe insurance and the financialization of disaster management</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11401</link> <description>Preempting the next disaster : Catastrophe insurance and the financialization of disaster management Grove, Kevin Jon The 2007 launch of the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) introduced a new mechanism of state security against the uncertainties of climate change. Proponents argue that increasing the ability of member-states to finance disaster recovery through catastrophe insurance mitigates the effects of increasingly frequent and intense hurricanes and thus contributes to climate change adaptation. In contrast, I offer a critical analysis of the CCRIF that draws out how it facilitates what I call the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfinancialization of disaster management\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The introduction of financial logics and techniques enables the state and capital to visualize a population\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds self-organizing adaptive capacity as both a threat to state-based forms of order and a value that can be leveraged on capital markets as catastrophe risk. Leveraging enhances a state\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds ability to repair its critical infrastructure and preemptively negate undesirable adaptations.The CCRIF blends risk pooling with parametric insurance techniques to turn the uncertainty surrounding a population\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds immanent adaptability into catastrophe risks that can be leveraged to enhance state security and capital accumulation in an emergent environment. </description> <dc:date>2012-04-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11358\"> <title>Rounds, Range Rovers and rurality : The drinking geographies of a New Squirearchy</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11358</link> <description>Rounds, Range Rovers and rurality : The drinking geographies of a New Squirearchy Heley, Jesse In an article detailing the ``cultural terrain'' of the village inn, Maye, Ilbery, and Kneafsey (2005) recently argued for the need of more culturally informed geographical work on the changing nature of the public house. A possible avenue of investigation, it is suggested, is a consideration of how various consumers make ``sense'' of their pubs, and how different practises and meanings overlay each other within this quintessentially rural setting. In undertaking such studies, notions of heterogeneous association and ``lifescape'' may be usefully employed in shedding light on the peculiar mixture of people, objects and interactions within this space. Drawing upon ethnographic research undertaken in a Bedfordshire pub, the ``Six Tuns'', this paper will consider a collective labelled the ``New Squirearchy''; a fraction of local residents who may be loosely defined through their apparent efforts to recreate the perceived roles and lifestyle of the archetypal English country gentleman. Here it is argued that the public house acts as a key space in which this identity is overtly negotiated and played out, and one that is appropriated within the midst of other pub-dwellers by these ``New Squires'' </description> <dc:date>2008-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
