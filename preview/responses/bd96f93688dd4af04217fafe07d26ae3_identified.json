The DFIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper Flood Insurance Rate Maps(FIRMs). The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The NFHL data are derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The specifications for the horizontal control of DFIRM data are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. The NFHL data contain layers in the Standard DFIRM datasets except for S_Label_Pt and S_Label_Ld. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all DFIRMs and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set. </abstract>          <purpose> The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which \"... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities\" (Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973). In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP. The NFHL data present the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The NFHL database is a subset of the information created for the FIS and serves as a means to archive a portion of the information collected during the FIS. </purpose>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <sngdate>                <caldate>20130206</caldate>             </sngdate>          </timeinfo>          <current>Represents effective DFIRMs and LOMRs available as of the publication date for the acquired State or Territory data set.</current>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>In work</progress>          <update>Monthly</update>       </status>       <spdom>          <bounding>             <westbc>-109.046399</westbc>             <eastbc>-103.045009</eastbc>             <northbc>37.000005</northbc>             <southbc>31.801672</southbc>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt>             <themekey>environment</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>FEMA NFIP Topic Category</themekt>             <themekey>DFIRM</themekey>             <themekey>FIRM</themekey>             <themekey>FEMA Flood Hazard Zone</themekey>             <themekey>DFIRM Database</themekey>             <themekey>Special Flood Hazard Area</themekey>             <themekey>Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map</themekey>             <themekey>CBRS</themekey>             <themekey>Coastal Barrier Resources System</themekey>             <themekey>Riverine Flooding</themekey>             <themekey>Coastal Flooding</themekey>             <themekey>NFIP</themekey>             <themekey>Base Flood Elevation</themekey>             <themekey>SFHA</themekey>             <themekey>Flood Insurance Rate Map</themekey>             <themekey>Floodway</themekey>          </theme>          <place>             <placekt>Spatial Reference System Identifiers</placekt>             <placekey>EPSG:4269</placekey>             <placekey>EPSG:7019</placekey>          </place>          <place>             <placekt>Country</placekt>             <placekey>U.S.</placekey>          </place>          <place>             <placekt>State</placekt>             <placekey>New Mexcio</placekey>          </place>       </keywords>       <accconst>None</accconst>       <useconst>Acknowledgement of FEMA would be appreciated in products derived from these data.</useconst>       <ptcontac>          <cntinfo>             <cntorgp>                <cntorg>Federal Emergency Management Agency</cntorg>             </cntorgp>             <cntaddr>                <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>                <address>500 C Street, S.W.</address>                <city>Washington</city>                <state>District of Columbia</state>                <postal>20472</postal>                <country>USA</country>             </cntaddr>             <cntvoice>1-877-FEMA-MAP</cntvoice>             <cntemail>fema-mscservice@dhs.gov</cntemail>          </cntinfo>       </ptcontac>       <native>Microsoft Windows Vista Version 6.1 (Build 7601) Service Pack 1; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000</native>       <crossref>          <citeinfo>             <origin>Federal Emergency Management Agency</origin>             <pubdate>20130206</pubdate>             <title>Unknown</title>             <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>             <pubinfo>                <pubplace>Washington, DC</pubplace>                <publish>Federal Emergency Management Agency</publish>             </pubinfo>             <onlink>http://www.msc.fema.gov</onlink>          </citeinfo>       </crossref>    </idinfo>    <dataqual>       <attracc>          <attraccr> The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data incorporates all Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map(DFIRM) databases published by FEMA, and any Letters Of Map Revision (LOMRs) that have been issued against those databases since their publication date. The DFIRM Database consists of community based vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hard copy FEMA FIRM. The published effective FIRM and DFIRM maps are issued as the official designation of the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs). As such they are adopted by local communities and form the basis for administration of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). For these purposes they are authoritative. Provisions exist in the regulations for public review, appeals and corrections of the flood risk information shown to better match real world conditions. As with any engineering analysis of this type, variation from the estimated flood heights and floodplain boundaries is possible. Details of FEMA's requirements for the FISs and flood mapping process that produces these data are available in the Guidelines and Specifications for Flood Hazard Mapping Partners. Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphics with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system. Independent quality control testing of FEMA's DFIRM databases was also performed. To obtain more detailed information in areas where Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) and/or floodways have been determined, users are encouraged to consult the Flood Profiles and Floodway Data and/or Summary of Stillwater Elevations tables contained within the FIS report that accompanies the individual components of the DFIRM data. Users should be aware that BFEs shown in the S_BFE table represent rounded whole-foot elevations. These BFEs are intended for flood insurance rating purposes only and should not be used as the sole source of flood elevation information. Accordingly, flood elevation data presented in the FIS report must be used in conjunction with the FIRM for purposes of construction and/or floodplain management. The 1-percent-annual-chance water-surface elevations shown in the S_XS table match the regulatory elevations shown in the FIS report. </attraccr>       </attracc>       <logic>When FEMA revises an FIS, adjacent studies are checked to ensure agreement between flood elevations at the boundaries. Likewise flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot elevations. They must be shown so that a profile recreated from the elevations on the FIRM will match the FIS profiles within one half of one foot.</logic>       <complete> Information contained in the National Flood Hazard Layer data reflects the content of the source materials. Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints. With new mapping, FEMA plans to maintain full detail in the spatial data it produces. However, older information is often transferred from existing maps where some generalization has taken place. Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP for use in insurance rating and for floodplain management. Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analyses of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall; information obtained through consultation with the communities; floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis. Both detailed and approximate analyses are employed. Generally, detailed analyses are used to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of communities. For areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data. Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are studied. The National Flood Hazard Layer data reflects the most current information available when the distribution data set was created. </complete>       <posacc>          <horizpa>             <horizpar> The National Flood Hazard Layer data consists of community based vector files and associated attributes produced in conjunction with the hardcopy FEMA FIRM.
