Weatherstone Chair of Supervisory Committee: Professor Bruce L Tempel Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Pharmacology The plasma membrane calcium ATPase 2 (PMCA2) pumps calcium from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space.  We show PMCA2 is highly expressed in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). &lt;italic&gt;dfw&lt;super&gt;2J&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/italic&gt; mutant mice have a null mutation in the gene that codes for PMCA2 causing deafness in homozygotes. Because MNTB neurons highly express PMCA2, we postulated that MNTB neurons lacking PMCA2 may have abnormal morphology. We found no significant difference in the gross morphology of MNTBs from&lt;italic&gt; dfw&lt;super&gt;2J&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/italic&gt; mutants, but did find a decrease in cell size between wildtype and &lt;italic&gt;dfw&lt;super&gt;2J&lt;/super&gt;/dfw&lt;super&gt;2J&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/italic&gt; mutants. The MNTB exhibits a tonotopic gradient with medial cells responding best to high frequencies and lateral cells responding best to low frequencies. In wildtype, the medial cells were significantly smaller than the lateral cells suggesting the presence of a cell size gradient. This size gradient was absent in &lt;italic&gt;dfw&lt;super&gt;2J&lt;/super&gt;/dfw&lt;super&gt;2J&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/italic&gt;. To determine if the absence of the neuronal size gradient was caused by abnormal inputs from the cochlea, we used diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) mice in which hair cells can be selectively ablated (Tong et al., 2011; Golub et al., 2012). These mice show no cell size gradient after hair cells were ablated suggesting auditory activity is necessary to maintain the gradient. We also show the gradient can return after a period of auditory deprivation suggesting changes in cell size are plastic and reversible. In addition to a cell size gradient, there are gradients of ion channels along the tonotopic axis in the MNTB (von Hehn et al., 2004; Leao et al,. 2006; Gazula et al, 2010). We used ICC to determine if PMCA2 is homogenously expressed throughout the MNTB.  While total PMCA2 is greater in lateral cells than medial cells, this is due to the cell size gradient.  The density of PMCA2 is homogenous along the tonotopic axis.  Additionally, we show auditory activity does not affect the density of PMCA2 in the MNTB. In summary, PMCA2 is highly expressed in the MNTB, there is a cell size gradient in the MNTB that requires auditory activity, and homogenous expression of PMCA2 in the MNTB is not affected by auditory inputs.

In the brain these receptors modulate many processes including learning, locomotion, pain, and reward behaviors. In this work we investigated the role of mAChRs in adult neurogenesis and further clarified the regulation of muscarinic agonist-induced seizures. We first investigated the role of mAChRs in adult neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the subgranular zone (SGZ). We were unable to detect any modulation of adult neurogenesis by mAChRs. Administration of muscarinic agonists or antagonists did not alter proliferation or viability of adult neural progenitor cells (aNPCs) &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt;. Similarly, muscarinic agonists did not alter proliferation or survival of new adult cells &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt;. Loss of the predominant mAChR subtype in the forebrain, the M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor, also caused no alterations in adult neurogenesis &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; or &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt;, indicating that the M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor does not mediate the actions of endogenous acetylcholine on adult neurogenesis. We also investigated the interaction between mAChRs and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) in muscarinic agonist pilocarpine-induced seizures. Previous work showed that pilocarpine-induced seizures require activation of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors; activation of these receptors also increases release of endocannabinoids which act at CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to reduce excitatory transmission. Using submaximal doses of pilocarpine, we found that pilocarpine-induced seizures were more severe in CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; KO mice compared to WT mice. Similarly, pretreatment with CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonists also increased pilocarpine seizure severity. In contrast, pretreatment with CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; agonists had no effect on pilocarpine seizure severity. These results support the hypothesis that endocannabinoids act at CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to reduce sensitivity to pilocarpine seizures and that endocannabinoid activity following pilocarpine administration is maximal at CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, so exogenous CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists cannot further modulate sensitivity to pilocarpine seizures. Because organophosphates require mAChR activity in order to induce seizures, we investigated whether seizures induced by the organophosphate paraoxon also shared the same regulation by M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors as pilocarpine seizures. We compared seizure behaviors induced by paraoxon in WT and M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; KO or CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; KO mice. We found that, in contrast to pilocarpine seizures, loss of M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had no effect on paraoxon seizure severity. CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist or agonist pretreatment also had no effect on paraoxon-induced seizure severity, indicating that CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors do not regulate paraoxon seizures. To further explore the difference in M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; regulation of pilocarpine and paraoxon seizures, we compared the ability of pilocarpine and paraoxon to induce seizure-independent ERK activation in the hippocampus of WT and M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; KO mice. Seizure-independent activation of ERK by pilocarpine in the hippocampus was dependent on M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. However, paraoxon did not activate ERK in the hippocampus when seizure activity was blocked in WT or M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; KO mice. This suggests that paraoxon administration, unlike pilocarpine, does not strongly activate M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the hippocampus. Altogether these results indicate that, despite a shared requirement for mAChRs to induce seizures, there are significant differences in the regulation of pilocarpine and paraoxon seizures.

Misregulated or aberrant signaling events in the pathway contributes to the pathology of diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration. It stands to reason that if we can monitor and influence Wnt/\\ufffd\\ufffd -Catenin signaling in stem and progenitor cells with sufficient resolution, it will be possible to design rationally targeted therapies. The body of work presented in this thesis contributes to the realization of this goal through discovery of molecular agents for controlling Wnt/\\ufffd\\ufffd -catenin signaling, examination of the biological mechanisms linking this pathway to disease, and identification of cases where the pharmacological perturbation of Wnt/\\ufffd\\ufffd -Catenin signaling may have therapeutic utility.

The PKA holoenzyme is a heterotetramer that exists as a dimer of regulatory (R) subunits that serves to sequester two catalytic (C) subunits in the absence of cAMP.  The R-subunit isoforms have the same general domain organization but are not functionally redundant and differ in their biochemical characteristics, expression levels and subcellular localization. The isolation of mutant R-subunits with useful experimental properties has allowed us to interrogate PKA-dependent signaling in vivo in a manner that cannot be accomplished using traditional knockout strategies.  Genetic disruption of any of the R-subunits results in a compensatory increase in the RI\\ufffd\\ufffd subunit, which occurs through reduced turnover of RI\\ufffd\\ufffd protein when bound to C-subunit in the holoenzyme.  This switch to the RI\\ufffd\\ufffd holoenzyme can confound interpretation of experimental results as basal PKA activity levels are significantly elevated due to increased cAMP sensitivity of the RI-containing holoenzyme.  Furthermore, any requirements for subcellular targeting of PKA must be closely scrutinized in light of the ability of a number of A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs) to bind RI, although for most AKAPs this occurs with greatly reduced affinity when compared to RII subunits. The specific goals of this thesis were to utilize two genetically modified mouse lines harboring mutations in distinct domains of the RI\\ufffd\\ufffd subunit to: a) assess the specific role of PKA in fluid homeostasis by disrupting kinase activity through expression of a dominant-negative mutation (RI\\ufffd\\ufffdB) and, b) examine the role of compartmentalized RI\\ufffd\\ufffd signaling &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt; through the introduction of alanine substitutions (RI\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;super&gt;ALA&lt;/&lt;super&gt;) in the dimerization/docking (D/D) domain, an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence that is required for the vast majority of PKA-AKAP interactions and subcellular targeting of the holoenzyme. A point mutation (G324D) in the C-terminal cAMP-binding site renders RI\\ufffd\\ufffdB (B site mutant) insensitive to physiological levels of cAMP while Cre-LoxP technology allowed us to target RI\\ufffd\\ufffdB to distinct cell populations.  Although PKA-dependent phosphorylation is required for apical trafficking and exocytosis of the renal water channel, AQP2, the precise role of PKA in short- and long-term regulation of AQP2 remains unclear.  I found that RI\\ufffd\\ufffdB expression in renal principal cells is sufficient to cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus while dramatically decreasing total AQP2 protein levels.  The effect of RI\\ufffd\\ufffdB was independent of changes in AQP2 mRNA and persisted with both acute (DDAVP treatment) and chronic (24-hour dehydration) activation of the V2R, suggesting a previously undetermined role for PKA in regulating protein stability and whole cell abundance of AQP2. To assess the role of RI\\ufffd\\ufffd-AKAP interactions &lt;italic&gt;in vivo&lt;/italic&gt;, we introduced alanine mutations (V22A, I27A) into the D/D that have been shown to disrupt binding to dual-specific AKAPs &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt;.  RI\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;super&gt;ALA&lt;/super&gt; abolished binding to the RI-selective AKAP, SKIP; surprisingly, these mutations also resulted in dramatic increases in RI\\ufffd\\ufffd protein in conjunction with apparent decreases in RI\\ufffd\\ufffd mRNA.  In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the protein stability of WT RI\\ufffd\\ufffd was increased by proteasome inhibition whereas the elevated RI\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;super&gt;ALA&lt;/super&gt; was unaffected suggesting that AKAP interactions may be a required part of the proteasome degradation pathway for RI\\ufffd\\ufffd.   RI\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;super&gt;ALA&lt;/super&gt; expression in MEFs also attenuated CREB phosphorylation and induction of the early response gene, c-Fos in response to elevated cAMP.  Mice expressing the RI\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;super&gt;ALA&lt;/super&gt; mutation had reduced locomotor activity and c-Fos induction was reduced in the striatum in response to the dopamine type 2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol.  This work has identified roles for PKA in regulating fluid homeostasis as well as a possible role for the D/D domain in the stability of RI\\ufffd\\ufffd and its subsequent impact on cAMP-dependent transcriptional regulation.
