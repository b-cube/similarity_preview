The LR model was used to predict the probability of nitrate contamination exceeding 4 mg/L in predominantly shallow, recently recharged ground waters of the United States.  The model contains variables representing (1) nitrogen (N) fertilizer loading, (2) percent cropland-pasture, (3) natural log of human population density, (4) percent well-drained soils, (5) depth to the seasonally high water table, and (6) presence or absence of unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers.  Observed and average predicted probabilities associated with deciles of risk are well correlated (r2 = 0.875), indicating that the LR model fits the data well.  The likelihood of nitrate contamination is greater in areas with high N loading and well-drained surficial soils over unconsolidated sand and gravels.  The LR model correctly predicted the status of nitrate contamination in 75 percent of wells in a validation data set from the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) program. Considering all wells used in both calibration and validation, observed median nitrate concentration increased from 0.24 to 8.30 mg/L as the mapped probability of nitrate exceeding 4 mg/L increased from less than or equal to 0.17 to greater than 0.83.    </abstract>    <purpose>Determining where shallow ground water is at risk of nitrate contamination can help managers allocate scarce resources for prevention, monitoring, and clean-up measures.    </purpose>    <supplinf>Related_Spatial_and_Tabular_Data_Sets:  The data set is provided as a GeoTIFF image (gwrisk.tif) as well as native ArcInfo Workstation GRID format (gwrisk.tgz).

A set of 13 explanatory variables was derived from these characteristics, and variables that have a significant influence were identified using logistic regression (LR) (Nolan, 2001).  The model was developed using data collected from more than 1200 wells by the first 20 NAWQA study units that began in 1991 and contained these variables: 1) N fertilizer loading to the land surface; 2) percent cropland-pasture; 3) natural log of human population density; 4) percent well-drained soils; 5) depth to seasonally high water table; and 6) presence or absence of a fracture zone within a surficial aquifer.  The model was used to identify variables that significantly influence nitrate contamination of shallow ground water, but was not validated with an independent data set and was not used in prediction.     </procdesc>     <procdate>200103</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>The previous LR model was refined (Nolan and others, 2002). The new model was recalibrated with three updated variables that represent improved sources of data and was validated using data collected from over 700 wells by a different set of NAWQA study units that began in 1994.  Three variables were updated: N loading, percent cropland-pasture, and presence or absence of rock fractures.  The current model uses separate estimates of farm and nonfarm fertilizer loading (USGS, unpublished data, 2001).  The county-level fertilizer estimates were allocated to NLCD land cover classes instead of being allocated equally to farm and nonfarm uses.  Farm fertilizer N was allocated to NLCD classes orchards/vineyards, row crops and small grains. Nonfarm fertilizer N was allocated to NLCD classes low-intensity residential and urban/recreational grasses.  Cropland-pasture is represented by the aggregation of NLCD classes pasture/hay, row crops, small grains, and fallow land. In the previous model, cropland-pasture was derived from Anderson land use/land cover data updated with 1990 population data.  A binary indicator variable representing the presence or absence of unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers was substituted for the fracture zone variable.  The other variables remain the same: natural log of human population density, percent well-drained soils, and depth to seasonally high water table.  Each of the variables in the LR model (farm-nonfarm N fertilizer loading, percent cropland-pasture, natural log of population density, percent well-drained soils, depth to the seasonally high water table, and presence or absence of unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers) was compiled within 1-km grid cells for prediction of nitrate contamination at the national scale.  All of the grid layers line up with a template representing the conterminous U.S. consisting of 3070 rows x 4855 columns, about 14.9 million total cells. About 7.6 million cells contain data; the rest are &quot;no data.&quot;  Each cell measures 1-km x 1-km.  The original 30-m NLCD were aggregated to give the percent of each category of land use within 1-km cells.  The area (square km) of each type of land use in each cell is the percent divided by 100.  The aggregated 1-km NLCD data were used to compute farm-nonfarm N fertilizer loading and percent cropland-pasture.  Farm-nonfarm N was determined by combining NLCD areas of farm and nonfarm land use with fertilizer application data by county.  The farm N application rate was calculated by dividing the total farm N applied (kg) in each county by the area of farm land within the county.  Farm N was applied to appropriate farm land classification areas within each 1-km cell by multiplying the application rate by the farm land area within the cell.  The procedure was duplicated for nonfarm land use and nonfarm fertilizer data by county.  Total farm-nonfarm N is the sum of farm N plus nonfarm N.  [Grid fertn92g.]  The NLCD percent cropland-pasture is the sum of the percent of all categories of cropland-pasture land use in each 1-km cell. [Grid tcroppas.]  The population data was derived from 1990 Census block group data representing people per square km.  The log is calculated as ln(pop90g + .00001) for each 1-km cell.  [Grid logpop90.]  The STATSGO soil mapping units were gridded at 1-km resolution.  Each mapping unit has multiple components.  For well-drained soils, each cell contains the total percent of hydrologic groups A and B, computed for all soil components within the mapping unit.  [Grid welldrg.]  For depth to seasonally high water table, each 1-km cell contains the weighted average value of the depth to water table, based on the relative percents of all soil components within the mapping unit.  [Grid wtdepavg.]  The binary unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifer indicator variable is a combination of unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers (Miller, 1998) and coarse-grained stratified sediments (Soller and Packard, 1998).  The principal aquifer boundaries were converted to 1-km grid format with all aquifers having a rock name of &quot;Unconsolidated sand and gravel aquifers&quot; coded 1.  All other aquifers were coded 0.  [Grid bsgaqg2.]  Soller&apos;s ALLQSURF map was converted to a 1-km grid having &quot;coarse-grained sediments&quot; (code 101) coded as 1 and everything else coded as 0.  [Grid qcgsed2.]  The two input grids are combined so that any cell having either sand and gravel = 1 or coarse-grained = 1 is coded as 1.  [Grid newbaqg.]  Explanatory variables in logistic the regression model are:  &gt;                                            Estimated    Wald &gt;Variable                                    coefficient  p value &gt;-----------------------------------------   -----------  ------- &gt;constant                                    -5.541       &lt;0.001 &gt;1992 fertilizer N (kg/ha)                    0.004       &lt;0.001 &gt;NLCD cropland-pasture (%)                    0.016       &lt;0.001 &gt;ln(1990 population density)                  0.229       &lt;0.001 &gt; (ln(people/km2) &gt;well-drained soils (%)                       0.025       &lt;0.001 &gt;depth to seasonally high water table (m)     1.088       &lt;0.001 &gt;presence or absence of unconsolidated        0.424        0.002 &gt;  sand and gravel aquifers  To make the national probability map, the values from the 1-km grid cells are put in to the LR equation to calculate for each cell the probability that nitrate in shallow ground water exceeds 4 mg/L.  An output cell is assigned a value of &quot;no data&quot; if any of the corresponding input data cells at that location is &quot;no data.&quot;  The following ArcInfo Workstation GRID commands produced the probability grid:  &gt;/*Probability grid with revised binary aquifer variable (using Soller&apos;s &gt;/* coarse grained stratified sediments) &gt;/* &gt;/*snap to window specified by xmin,ymin, xmax,ymax (geolg grid) &gt;setwindow -2505700.250 122020.555 2349299.750 3192020.555 d:/ancill/wolock/geol/geolg &gt;setcell 1000 &gt;&amp;if [exists pgridrev -grid] &amp;then  kill pgridrev &gt;/*This plugs the values for the input variables into the LR equation: &gt;pgridrev = (exp (-5.5408 + (.00373 * fertn92g) + (.0162 * tcroppas) ~ &gt; + (.2286 * logpop90) + ~ &gt;(.0249 * welldrg)  +  (1.0879 * wtdepavg)  + (.4245 * newbaqg) )) / ~ &gt;(1 + (exp (-5.5408 + (.00373 * fertn92g) + (.0162 * tcroppas) + (.2286 * logpop90) +  ~ &gt;(.0249 * welldrg) +   (1.0879 * wtdepavg) +  (.4245 * newbaqg) )))  GRID cells were randomly selected from this dataset and checked by hand to ensure the correct probability values were calculated using the logistic regression equation and the input data values.  In most NAWQA study units, the predicted exceedence probability reasonably approximates the observed proportion of wells with nitrate exceeding 4 mg/L.  This indicates that the model adequately simulates regional N loading and aquifer susceptibility in these areas.  The model inaccurately predicts the probability in some areas, such as the Rio Grande Valley.     </procdesc>     <procdate>200111</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>The LR values were grouped by category.

The TIFF actually has your index values stored with an embedded colormap. So I&apos;d add the index values to your table of concentrations in the supp info section, as you did in the attribute overview.  [done]  2. I think you can and should skip the world file, as the georeferencing should be stored in the TIFF header, accessible to AV3, ArcGIS and any other software that recognizes GeoTIFF. But you may want to *add* the AUX file generated by ArcCatalog for the TIFF as that would make the coordinate system (&quot;projection&quot; in workstation parlance) of the TIFF available to ArcGIS.  [done]  3. Suggest using &gt; instead of ! to format tables [either would work]  4. ARC/INFO = ArcInfo or ArcInfo Workstation. I use the terminology [ArcInfo Workstation] GRID as the software; &quot;grid&quot; is a data set. You seem to be using this convention some of the time in your narratives, but not all the time. The downside of this is that reviewers may want you to define GRID because it looks like an acronym. It isn&apos;t. [done]  5. Suggest specifying processing window in your AML as x1 y1 x2 y2 rather than referring to the grid &quot;geolg&quot; and its snapping which was projected from Soller&apos;s map??  [done]  6. Suggest instead of &quot;using this aml&quot; just say &quot;using the following ArcInfo Workstation GRID commands&quot;  [done]     </procdesc>     <procdate>20030908</procdate>    </procstep>
