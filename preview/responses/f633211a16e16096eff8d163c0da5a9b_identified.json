The&#xd; cores from these wells have a wide range of present-day burial&#xd; temperatures (40&#xd; ?&#xd; to 220&#xd; ?&#xd; C). The rocks in these basins were&#xd; deposited under highly variable conditions, sometimes resulting&#xd; in substantially different organic matter (OM) types in rocks tens&#xd; of meters vertically apart from each other in one well. The&#xd; kinetic response of these different OM types to equivalent wellknown&#xd; burial histories is a pivotal point of this study.&#xd; In the Los Angeles and Ventura Basins, rock organic-richness&#xd; significantly increased with depth, as did kerogen hydrogen&#xd; content, and the percentage of fine-grained versus coarsegrained&#xd; rocks. The shales in these basins are perceived as containing&#xd; primarily hydrogen-rich amorphous OM. In actuality,&#xd; the shallowest 2,000 to 3,000 m of rocks in the basins, and at&#xd; least the upper 6,000 m of rocks in parts of the Los Angeles&#xd; Basin central syncline, are dominated by type III/IV OM. In the&#xd; Los Angeles Basin, mainstage hydrocarbon (HC) generation&#xd; commences in the type III/IV OM at present-day burial temperatures&#xd; of 85&#xd; ?&#xd; to 110&#xd; ?&#xd; C, most likely around 100&#xd; ?&#xd; C, and is largely&#xd; complete by 220&#xd; ?&#xd; C. In the Southern San Joaquin Valley Basin,&#xd; mainstage HC generation commences in type III/IV OM at&#xd; 150&#xd; ?&#xd; C and is also largely complete by 220&#xd; ?&#xd; C. In the Ventura&#xd; Basin, mainstage HC generation commences above 140&#xd; ?&#xd; C in&#xd; type III/IV OM. The apparent lower temperatures for commencement&#xd; of HC generation in the Los Angeles Basin are&#xd; attributed to the fact that parts of the basin were cooled from&#xd; maximal burial temperatures by increased meteoric water flows&#xd; during the last glaciations.&#xd; All aspects of organic metamorphism, including mainstage&#xd; HC generation, are strongly suppressed in rocks with hydrogenrich&#xd; OM in these basins. For example, ROCK-EVAL data suggest&#xd; that mainstage HC generation has not commenced in rocks&#xd; with hydrogen-rich OM at present-day temperatures of 198?C.&#xd; This observation is attributed to much stronger bonds in hydrogen-&#xd; rich OM compared to types III and IV OM and, therefore,&#xd; significantly higher burial temperatures are required to break&#xd; these bonds. This difference in OM kinetics has profound ramifications&#xd; for petroleum-geochemical exploration models.&#xd; Organic-matter characteristics inherited from original depositional&#xd; conditions were overlaid on, and at times confused&#xd; interpretation of, characteristics from organic metamorphism in&#xd; all study areas. In all the basins examined in this study, immature&#xd; fine-grained rocks occasionally had high to very high&#xd; carbon-normalized concentrations of pre-generation indigenous&#xd; bitumen. This unusual characteristic may be due to unique depositional&#xd; conditions in these basins.</abstract><physicalDescription><form>34 p.</form><form>U.S. Department of the interior, U.S. Geological Survey,</form></physicalDescription><location><url note=\"THUMBNAIL\">http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/thumbnails/usgs_thumb.jpg</url><url displayLabel=\"html\" note=\"INDEX PAGE\">http://pubs.usgs.gov/bul/b2174-a/</url></location><note type=\"citation/reference\">Organic metamorphism in the California petroleum basins; Chapter A, Rock-Eval and vitrinite reflectance; 1999; B; 2174-A; Bulletin; Price, Leigh C.; Pawlewicz, Mark J.; Daws, Ted A.</note><edition>Version 1.0</edition><languageTerm>ENGLISH</languageTerm><relatedItem type=\"original\"><titleInfo><title>Bulletin</title></titleInfo></relatedItem></mods></modsCollection>",
