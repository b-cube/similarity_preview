The data cover stream and estuary survey locations sampled manually from 2007 to 2011 at varying intervals between fortnightly and quarterly. Survey locations were selected as draining the main landscape classes in the catchment, which include upland (&gt;300m) and lowland (&lt;300m) environments under trees, moorland or improved agriculture. Also included are a suite of locations on the major rivers, and in the estuary. The purpose of the data is to provide support for estimating loads and testing hypotheses relating to the relationship between subcatchment properties and water quality, and the relative importance of mixing and in-stream processes in influencing downstream water quality.   Streams draining peat, with high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, are well represented.  Upland drainage is generally acidic, and lowland circum-neutral. The lowland rivers are not heavily contaminated with nutrients, although they show evidence of some loss of nitrates in particular. There is little industry in the catchment beyond agriculture and tourism, though there is some legacy contamination from metal mines in a small part of the catchment.  Measurements are provided for major cations and anions, pH, alkalinity, DOC, Al, Fe and conductivity for most samples, with values for a wide range of trace elements for a limited number of samples.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conwy Catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>stream</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>lake</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>quarterly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC0454</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-07-26T09:21:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/cd7db09f-edf6-4b06-b878-f1be6c649e3a\">     <title>Conwy Catchment - Nant Y Brwyn Discharge dataset</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/cd7db09f-edf6-4b06-b878-f1be6c649e3a</link>     <description>Discharge data and in-stream temperature for a peatland headwater stream of the Conwy catchment, North Wales are presented from march 2008 until present. The stream for which the data represents is the Nant y Brwyn situated on the Migneint blanket bog within Snowdonia National Park. The purpose of the data is to calculate annual run-off estimates for the Nant y Brwyn catchment and to provide support for estimating fluvial carbon fluxes. Note: there are gaps in this data set due to equipment/battery failures and/or freezing of the stream.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrometry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conwy Catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>stream</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC04016 T3</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7bb6c7df-7630-4621-a0d4-eacc3ec2202b\">     <title>Conwy Catchment - Llyn Conwy water temperature profile data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7bb6c7df-7630-4621-a0d4-eacc3ec2202b</link>     <description>In-lake temperature data for a peatland headwater lake of the Conwy catchment, North Wales are presented from November 2006 until December 2008. The Lake for which the data represents is Llyn Conwy situated on the Migneint blanket bog within Snowdonia National Park. The data is from a temperature string suspended from a buoy anchored above the deepest part of the lake. Temperature is recorded at 2m intervals throughout the lake profile from 1 to 19m. The purpose of this data is to investigate water column stability and to determine when, and to what degree stratification/mixing occurs and to make inferences about the effect of this on productivity, nutrient and chemical cycling. Note: there are gaps in this data set due to equipment/battery failures and/or freezing of the lake surface which meant it was not accessible.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>limnology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conwy Catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>lake</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03715</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>T3</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T13:35:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
