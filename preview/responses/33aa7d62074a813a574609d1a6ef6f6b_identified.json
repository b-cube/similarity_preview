Includes data on habitat pot gear study: fishing locations, pot types, deployment and retrieval dates, and catch in pots (octopus and bycatch).  Also includes specimen data (sex. weight, mantle length, gonad maturity, gonad weights, GSI) from octopus in life history study.  Life history specimens come from pot gear fishing and donations from commercial fishermen.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"23083\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>AFSC/REFM: Alaska groundfish AGEDATA database,1982 to present</title>          <abstract>The AFSC AGEDATA database is a collection of historic and ongoing fish ageing efforts by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Age and Growth Program from 1982 to present.  The database contains over 900,000 observations of biological and collection data from survey and observer fish specimen collections spanning from 1976 to 2014.  Primarily the species aged are comprised of commercially important species of Alaska and the west coast such as walleye pollock, Pacific cod, rockfish, sablefish, and flatfish, although smaller numbers of other species are included as well such as skates, sculpins, and forage fish species.  Specimen data includes fish age estimates, fish length, sex, weight, collection coordinates, date of collection, fish ageing methodologies, age reader information, and ageing structure descriptions.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"23082\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>AFSC/REFM: Alaskan Pacific cod 18 Oxygen age validation study</title>          <abstract>The data (Appendix 1) describe multiple micro samples from 40 specimens.  The data set first provides specimen identification information:           Specimen ID, estimated age, and AFSC RACE cruise number.  Second, the data describes the milling and physical properties of each milled sampled, up to 42           samples per specimens: volume and mass.  Finally, the data contain information and results from mass spectrometry analysis measuring d13C and d18O.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"22261\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>AFSC/REFM: Alaskan flatfish chronology Black et al</title>          <abstract>Annual growth increment patterns observed in the hard parts of many marine organisms are often related to factors in the physical environment, and investigators are increasingly using dendrochronology (tree-ring science) methods to explore these relationships. Dendrochronology techniques were applied to otolith growth increments in 3 flatfish species collected from the eastern Bering Sea: northern rock sole Lepidopsetta polyxystra, yellowfin sole Limanda aspera, and Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus. Within each species, otoliths were visually crossdated to ensure that the correct calendar year was assigned to each growth increment. Growth-increment widths were measured in each otolith, crossdating was statistically checked, and a master chronology was generated for each species by averaging measurement time series after age-related growth declines had been removed. The 3 final chronologies spanned 18 to 20 yr and were significantly correlated with each other, indicating a high level of growth synchrony among species. Final chronologies were compared to annual and monthly climate variables, and were most strongly related to summertime eastern Bering Sea bottom temperatures.</abstract>          <relation-note>Loaded by FGDC Metadata Uploader, batch 5121, 09-23-2014 17:05  The following FGDC sections are not currently supported in InPort, but were preserved and will be included in the FGDC export: -  Taxonomy (FGDC:taxonomy) -  Entity Attribute Information (FGDC:eainfo) -  Lineage (FGDC:lineage)</relation-note>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"22257\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>AFSC/REFM: Alaskan yellowfin sole extended chronology Black et al 2013</title>          <abstract>Annual growth increment patterns observed in the hard parts of many marine organisms are often related to factors in the physical environment, and investigators are increasingly using dendrochronology (tree-ring science) methods to explore these relationships. Dendrochronology techniques were applied to the otolith growth increments of yellowfin sole Limanda aspera to determine the extent to which somatic growth and otolith growth are coupled. Otoliths were visually crossdated to ensure that the correct calendar year was assigned to each growth increment. Growth-increment widths were measured in each otolith, crossdating was statistically checked, and a master chronology was generated by averaging measurement time series after age-related growth declines had been removed. The final chronology spanned 43 yr and was significantly related to Bering Sea bottom temperature and sea surface temperature. The relationship between otolith growth and somatic growth was explored using regression analysis. Population-wide otolith anomalies were found to be significantly related to population-wide anomalies in body size, as indexed by fish weight-length ratios.</abstract>          <relation-note>Loaded by FGDC Metadata Uploader, batch 5120, 09-23-2014 17:04  The following FGDC sections are not currently supported in InPort, but were preserved and will be included in the FGDC export: -  Taxonomy (FGDC:taxonomy) -  Entity Attribute Information (FGDC:eainfo) -  Lineage (FGDC:lineage)</relation-note>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"23103\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>AFSC/REFM: Flatfish maturity near Kodiak, 2012-2013</title>          <abstract>The dataset is comprised of individual fish records from collections made during port sampling at Kodiak Alaska for the purpose of updating maturity estimates for selected GOA flatfish.
