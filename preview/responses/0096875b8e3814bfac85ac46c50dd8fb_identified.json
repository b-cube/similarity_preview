The plaintiff in the lawsuit was <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>. The speech does not argue the case itself, but argues a <soCalled>special plea</soCalled>, a <foreign lang=\"grc\">paragrafh/</foreign>, essentially a plea that the whole case be thrown out of court (see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 33\" n=\"Dem. 33.2\">Dem. 33.2</bibl>). The speech argues that the lawsuit is baseless and malicious, but to prove that, the speak has to give many details about the history of the business between himself and <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>, so we know (at least one version of) much of what transpired. For the sake of telling the story, we will name the anonymous defendant, simply, Defendant.</p> <p><name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name> owned a shipt and some slaves. At one point he took out a loan for 40 minae, using his ship as collateral, but was unable to pay the loan back on schedule. Faced with having his ship seized in a foreclosure, he went to a man named <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name>, who gave him 10 minae. Then he went to Defendant, who borrowed 30 minae from a bank owned by <name type=\"person\">Heracleides</name>. Defendant took the 30 minae he had borrowed and the 10 from <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> and paid off <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>&#8217; loan. So now Defendant held a mortgage on <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>&#8217; ship and slaves for 40 minae, but he also owed the bank of <name type=\"person\">Heracleides</name> 30 minae and owed <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> 10 minae.</p> <p>Unfortunately, <name type=\"person\">Heracleides</name>&#8217; bank failed, and people to whom the bank owed money demanded the 30 minae that Defendant had owed the bank. Defendant signed his mortgage on <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>&#8217; ship over to the bank's creditors, but with a lien of 10 minae, so <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name>&#8217;s money was still secure. At this point, <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> caught <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name> trying to sail his ship away from <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> in an attempt to avoid losing his ship. Since <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>&#8217; escape would have cost <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> his 10 minae, <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> physically prevented him from taking the ship out of the harbor.</p> <p>Eventually, <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name>&#8217; ship was sold for 40 minae, and all the debts were taken care of. But <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name> and <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> sued each other, each claiming that the other had treated him violently during the confrontation over the ship. For a time it seemed that the matter would not go to trial, but would be handled by arbitration, but that arrangement fell through. But before the case could come to trial, <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> had to leave <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> because his family, living in the <placeName key=\"Chersonese\">Chersonese</placeName>, had been killed in an earthquake. While <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> was away, <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name> came to court and won a default judgement against the absent <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> for 20 minae in damages.</p> <p>Then <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name> sued Defendant for those 20 minae, claiming that Defendant was responsible for <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name>&#8217;s debt. That lawsuit is the occasion for this speech. Defendant is arguing that, first, he was not serving as security for Parmeno's debts, and, second, that the award granted to <name type=\"person\">Apaturius</name> against <name type=\"person\">Parmeno</name> was wrong. As is so often the case, we do not know whether this speech was successful or not.</p> <byline>Christopher Blackwell</byline> </div0>   </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
