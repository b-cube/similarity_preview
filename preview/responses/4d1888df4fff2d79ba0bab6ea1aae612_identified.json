Although it is intended as a resource for all engineering bibliographers, new librarians or those new to the technical fields may find it especially&#13; useful. Engineers (and engineering students) use information quite differently than other disciplines, and this can make collection development a daunting task. Furthermore, it is common for librarians&#13; with no background in engineering or technology to be assigned to manage the engineering collection.&#13; The information and tips contained in this chapter are meant to make this job easier.
