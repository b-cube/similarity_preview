While some work was published on architectures and decentralized P2P-based mechanisms for such clouds, yet no complete system has been presented which implements such cloud systems without important limitations. We present the community home gateway, a computer system attached to a wireless community network router, able to host platform and application services. Different to current home gateways and other low-end systems, the community home gateway offers resource virtualization, and can thus be used as cloud resource. The community home gateway removes the lack of a system open for service contributions and therefore constitutes an important step towards building P2P clouds with low-end devices. While we present the community home gateway as being part of a P2P community cloud, the applications scenarios of the system that can be imagined go beyond community networks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>     </record>      </records> </xml>",
