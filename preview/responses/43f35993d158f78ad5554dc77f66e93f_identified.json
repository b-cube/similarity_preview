Variation occurs non-randomly across the genome, and mechanisms for this remain to be defined. Here we report that the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments have significantly increased levels of nucleotide substitution, indicating a replicative origin for such mutations. Using a novel method, emRiboSeq, we map the genome-wide contribution of polymerases, and show that despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-alpha (Pol-alpha) is retained in vivo, comprising ~1.5% of the mature genome. We propose that DNA-binding proteins that rapidly re-associate post-replication act as partial barriers to Pol-delta-mediated displacement of Pol-alpha-synthesized DNA, resulting in incorporation of such Pol-alpha tracts and increased mutation rates at specific sites. We observe a mutational cost to chromatin and regulatory protein binding, resulting in mutation hotspots at regulatory elements, with signatures of this process detectable in both yeast and humans. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-23T13:45:33Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Stress hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients and their 3-year risk of diabetes: A Scottish Retrospective cohort study</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/611\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/611</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:34Z</updated> <published>2014-08-11T09:57:17Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Stress hyperglycaemia in hospitalised patients and their 3-year risk of diabetes: A Scottish Retrospective cohort study Background: Hyperglycaemia during hospital admission is common in patients who are not known to have diabetes and is&#13; associated with adverse outcomes. The risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes, however, is not known. We linked&#13; a national database of hospital admissions with a national register of diabetes to describe the association between&#13; admission glucose and the risk of subsequently developing type 2 diabetes.&#13; Methods and Findings: In a retrospective cohort study, patients aged 30 years or older with an emergency admission to hospital between 2004 and 2008 were included. Prevalent and incident diabetes were identified through the Scottish Care Information (SCI)-Diabetes Collaboration national registry. Patients diagnosed prior to or up to 30 days after hospitalisation were defined as prevalent diabetes and were excluded. The predicted risk of developing incident type 2 diabetes during the 3 years following hospital discharge by admission glucose, age, and sex was obtained from logistic regression models. We performed separate analyses for patients aged 40 and older, and patients aged 30 to 39 years. Glucose was measured&#13; in 86,634 (71.0%) patients aged 40 and older on admission to hospital. The 3-year risk of developing type 2 diabetes was 2.3% (1,952/86,512) overall, was ,1% for a glucose #5 mmol/l, and increased to approximately 15% at 15 mmol/l. The risks at 7 mmol/l and 11.1 mmol/l were 2.6% (95% CI 2.5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2.7) and 9.9% (95% CI 9.2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd10.6), respectively, with one in four (21,828/86,512) and one in 40 (1,798/86,512) patients having glucose levels above each of these cut-points. For patients aged 30\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd39, the risks at 7 mmol/l and 11.1 mmol/l were 1.0% (95% CI 0.8\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1.3) and 7.8% (95% CI 5.7\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd10.7), respectively, with one in eight (1,588/11,875) and one in 100 (120/11,875) having glucose levels above each of these cut-points. The risk of diabetes was&#13; also associated with age, sex, and socio-economic deprivation, but not with specialty (medical versus surgical), raised white cell count, or co-morbidity. Similar results were obtained for pre-specified sub-groups admitted with myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and stroke. There were 25,193 deaths (85.8 per 1,000 person-years) over 297,122 person-years, of which 2,406 (8.1 per 1,000 person-years) were attributed to vascular disease. Patients with glucose levels of 11.1 to 15 mmol/l and .15 mmol/l had higher mortality than patients with a glucose of ,6.1 mmol/l (hazard ratio 1.54; 95% CI 1.42\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1.68 and 2.50; 95% CI 2.14\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2.95, respectively) in models adjusting for age and sex. Limitations of our study include that we did not have data on ethnicity or body mass index, which may have improved prediction and the results have not been validated in non-white populations or populations outside of Scotland.&#13; Conclusion: Plasma glucose measured during an emergency hospital admission predicts subsequent risk of developing&#13; type 2 diabetes. Mortality was also 1.5-fold higher in patients with elevated glucose levels. Our findings can be used to inform patients of their long-term risk of type 2 diabetes, and to target lifestyle advice to those patients at highest risk. </summary> <dc:date>2014-08-11T09:57:17Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>A genome-wide screen in human embryonic stem cells reveals novel sites of allele-specific histone modification associated with known disease loci</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/239\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/239</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:36Z</updated> <published>2012-10-31T15:42:05Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">A genome-wide screen in human embryonic stem cells reveals novel sites of allele-specific histone modification associated with known disease loci Background&#13; &#13; Chromatin structure at a given site can differ between chromosome copies in a cell, and such imbalances in chromatin structure have been shown to be important in understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling several disease loci. Human genetic variation, DNA methylation, and disease have been intensely studied, uncovering many sites of allele-specific DNA methylation (ASM). However, little is known about the genome-wide occurrence of sites of allele-specific histone modification (ASHM) and their relationship to human disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent and characteristics of sites of ASHM in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs).&#13; Results&#13; &#13; Using a statistically rigorous protocol, we investigated the genomic distribution of ASHM in hESCs, and their relationship to sites of allele-specific expression (ASE) and DNA methylation. We found that, although they were rare, sites of ASHM were substantially enriched at loci displaying ASE. Many were also found at known imprinted regions, hence sites of ASHM are likely to be better markers of imprinted regions than sites of ASM. We also found that sites of ASHM and ASE in hESCs colocalize at risk loci for developmental syndromes mediated by deletions, providing insights into the etiology of these disorders.&#13; Conclusion&#13; &#13; These results demonstrate the potential importance of ASHM patterns in the interpretation of disease loci, and the protocol described provides a basis for similar studies of ASHM in other cell types to further our understanding of human disease susceptibility. </summary> <dc:date>2012-10-31T15:42:05Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>International Stroke Trial database (version 2)</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/128\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/128</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:36Z</updated> <published>2011-11-02T14:09:46Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">International Stroke Trial database (version 2) The International Stroke Trial (IST) was one the biggest randomised trials in acute stroke.
