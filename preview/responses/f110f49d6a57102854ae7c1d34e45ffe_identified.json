The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.   Despite the widespread concerns regarding the use of pesticides in food production and the availability of potentially viable biological pest control strategies in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems, the UK cereal crop production remains a bastion of pesticide use. This project aimed to understand further the reasons for this lack of adoption, using the control of summer cereal aphids as a case study.  Reasons for this lack of adoption of biocontrol remain a complex interplay of both technical and economic problems. Economists highlight the potential path dependency of an industry to continue to employ a suboptimal technology, caused by past dynamics of adoption resulting in differential private cost structures of each technique. Further, risk aversion on the part of farmers regarding the perceived efficacy of a new technology may also limit up-take. This may be particularly important when IPM rests on portfolios of technologies and when little scientific understanding exists on the effect of portfolio and scale of adoption on overall efficacy. Faced with this, farmers will not adopt a socially superior IPM technology and there exists a clear need for public policy action. This action may take the form of minimising uncertainty through carefully designed research programs, government funding and dissemination of the results of large-scale research studies or direct public support for farm landscape and farm system changes that can promote biocontrol.  This research looked at alternatives to the use of insecticides in arable agriculture and the difficulties facing producers in switching over to them. Two approaches were explored: habitat manipulations, to encourage predators and parasites, and using naturally occurring odours to manipulate predator distribution as model technologies. Scale and portfolio effects on biocontrol efficacy have been investigated in controlled and field scale experiments. Aim is to improve the way research and development of new products and techniques are carried out to help break the dependence on chemical pesticides.  'Semiochemical experiment data, 2005-2009 - RELU Re-bugging the system: promoting adoption of alternative pest management strategies in field crop systems' data from this same research project are also available through the CEH Information Gateway.  In addition, socio-economic research has been used to help direct natural science research into the development and evaluation of a combination of habitat management and semiochemical push-pull strategies of appropriate scale and complementarity to yield viable, commercially attractive and sustainable alternatives to the use of insecticides in cereal crop agriculture. These socio-economic data are available through the UK Data Archive under study number 6960 (see online resources).

The data were collected as part of the Farm Scale Evaluations (FSEs), a four-year programme of research by independent researchers aimed at studying the effect that the management practices associated with Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (GMHT) crops might have on farmland wildlife, when compared with weed control used with non-GM crops. Data were collected by a consortium of: the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, ITE (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, CEH), the Institute of Arable Crop Research (now Rothamstead Research, IACR) and the Scottish Crop Research Institute, SCRI (now the James Hutton Institute, JHI). Data were collected for four crops overall (Beet, Maize, Spring-sown Oilseed Rape and Winter-sown oilseed Rape).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>agro-ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>arable farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>crops</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>environmental impact</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biodiversity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weeds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>arable</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>seedbank</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>invertebrates</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>functional groups</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>sugar beet</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>maize</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>trophic interactions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01732</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-02-27T10:10:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/86cd1a60-64f1-4087-a9f1-a3d8a9f8f535\">     <title>Farm scale evaluations of herbicide tolerant genetically modified crops - beet</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/86cd1a60-64f1-4087-a9f1-a3d8a9f8f535</link>     <description>This dataset consists of a range of ecological measurements collected from a set of arable fields, each sown with a combination of genetically modified and conventional beet crops. Measurements include species counts in the following areas: weed seedbank, vegetation in the crop, field edge vegetation, invertebrates.
