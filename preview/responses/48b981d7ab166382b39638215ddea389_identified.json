The chapter deals with the relationship between the Spiritualist \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdapparitions\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and modernist apparatus. It argues that the western \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdimage\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of disincarnate spirits produced since the 1860s has been shaped significantly by the devices used to discern and document them. The study focuses upon the contribution that the camera and audio recorder has made to both the fabrication of spirit entities and the endeavour to contact the dead. Photography and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdaudiography\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd were, in the context of Spiritualism, the technological equivalents of clairvoyance and clairaudience (the supernatural abilities to see and hear the departed). Whereas the spiritualist medium could receive and send information to and from this world and the next, technological communication with the dead was unidirectional. The camera and audio recorder were merely depositories for the visible and audible presence of the dead, with whom one could no more interact than with the actors on a television and radio. While these new mechanical and electrical devices were, in this respect, far less serviceable than the older and more modest contrivances of the ouija board and planchette, they offered, it was supposed, a more objective and reliable demonstration of the reality of spirits. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, technologies such as the camera, radiograph, phonograph, electron microscope, deep-space telescope, and parabolic microphone brought what was previously invisible and inaudible into the realms of perception and permanence. Spiritualism redirected these facilities from the natural to the supernatural world. In so doing, technology was requisitioned to not only legitimize anomalous phenomena but also bridge the divide between antiquity and modernity, superstition and empiricism. In this context: 1. The study examines the iconography and reception of spirits as mediated by technology. 2. Uniquely, it presents a comparative analysis of so-called spirit (or psychic) photographs and Electronic Voice Phenomenon (EVP). This in order to discern how their distinctive formal conditions (the one static and visual, and the other kinetic or time based and audible), and their means of encoding (sensitised emulsion and magnetic tape initially, and digital media subsequently) contributed to a cultural understanding of death, the afterlife, and the nature of spirits. 3. The study also explores the commonalities of process (ordinarily, neither the image nor voice of the spirit was evident when the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrecording\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd was made; they were manifest only after the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdimage\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd on the photograph or tape was \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdplayed-back\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). 4. Furthermore, it explores the commonalities of perceptual and auditory pareidolia \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the viewer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds or listener\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds propensity to interpret vague stimulus (the blurs and slurs on the surface of a negative or the interference of white noise on the soundtrack) as something known (a figure or a voice). 5. Finally, the chapter examines the discourse on spirit, (haunted) technology, and mediation presented in popular cultural forms, including films such as Lynch\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) and Nakata\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Ring (1998). </description> <dc:date>2013-12-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26919\"> <title>R B V E \\ufffd\\ufffd T N \\ufffd\\ufffd O A E V A N R O B E R T S</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26919</link> <description>R B V E \\ufffd\\ufffd T N \\ufffd\\ufffd O A E V A N R O B E R T S John </description> <dc:date>2013-05-31T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26776\"> <title>Kangchenjunga: Imaging a Himalayan Mountain</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26776</link> <description>Kangchenjunga: Imaging a Himalayan Mountain Simon </description> <dc:date>2005-05-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26568\"> <title>Developing Digital Tusche Washes for Photoplate Lithography</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26568</link> <description>Developing Digital Tusche Washes for Photoplate Lithography Paul Since 2008 Croft has been interested exploring the interface between\\ufffd\\ufffddigital and analogue printmaking with specific interest incorporating digital\\ufffd\\ufffdmethods of drawing with traditional techniques of stone and plate lithography. The research for this output culminated in a workshop demonstration and\\ufffd\\ufffdpresentation for\\ufffd\\ufffdIMPACT 7\\ufffd\\ufffdIntersections\\ufffd\\ufffdand\\ufffd\\ufffdCounterpoints:\\ufffd\\ufffdInternational Conference of Printmaking at Monash University, Melbourne,\\ufffd\\ufffd2011 and to the subsequent publication of two articles Levels of Sophistication \\ufffd\\ufffdfor the UK journal Printmaking Today\\ufffd\\ufffdVolume 21 Issue 1 ISSN 0960 9253 and Developing\\ufffd\\ufffdDigital Tusche Wash for Photoplate Lithography for the Australian journal\\ufffd\\ufffdIMPRINT \\ufffd\\ufffdVolume 47 Issue 4 ISSN 0313 3907 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;none;text-autospace:none\"&gt;The research has evolved from a long series of projects dating back to 1996,\\ufffd\\ufffdwhen initial research Developing\\ufffd\\ufffd Customised Wash Palettes and Brush Tools was completed for The Tamarind\\ufffd\\ufffdInstitute. The foundations for current research were established through two international\\ufffd\\ufffdportfolio print projects including The\\ufffd\\ufffdMachine Stops: Inkjet My Foot (University of Tucson, Arizona 2008) and From Stone to Digital (University of\\ufffd\\ufffdNevada, 2008) both of which were exhibited at The Southern Graphics Conference,\\ufffd\\ufffdRichmond, Virginia USA in 2008; and were discussed in an \\ufffd\\ufffdarticle entitled\\ufffd\\ufffdPrintmaking 2028 published by\\ufffd\\ufffdGrapheion\\ufffd\\ufffdCzech Republic 2009. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;none;text-autospace:none\"&gt;The emphasis for current research has focussed upon not only the\\ufffd\\ufffdcontinuing development and refinement of digital tusche wash but also has\\ufffd\\ufffdsought to discover a digital equivalent for the application, pooling, drying\\ufffd\\ufffdand reticulation of wash on screen. Significantly this research, which has\\ufffd\\ufffdincluded trials using a Wacom Intuos 4 Graphics Tablet, Adobe Photoshop CS4 and\\ufffd\\ufffdnotably Corel Painter 12, has led to innovative ways for developing digital\\ufffd\\ufffdtusche wash. Using Corel's facility to develop and store an ever expanding\\ufffd\\ufffdlibrary of washes and by maximising the use of Cloning Brushes and Nozzle\\ufffd\\ufffdFiles; this research has enabled exciting new possibilities for developing\\ufffd\\ufffdlayers of drawing - that ultimately can be outputted for printing from\\ufffd\\ufffdphotoplate as colour runs in any given print. Commonly these colour runs are\\ufffd\\ufffdprinted in series and are then overprinted with a key image from stone drawn\\ufffd\\ufffdusing conventional techniques.\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;none;text-autospace:none\"&gt;That these customised wash palettes can be further manipulated using a\\ufffd\\ufffdrange of digital tools serves to provide a limitless range of drawing which\\ufffd\\ufffdwhen juxtaposed with conventional lithographic drawing creates interesting and\\ufffd\\ufffdexciting dynamics in the final images. Customised washes can easily be\\ufffd\\ufffdexaggerated in scale, inverted, resized, cut and pasted to print with whatever\\ufffd\\ufffddesign or composition is being developed. The research has also proved that\\ufffd\\ufffdcolour runs can be easily developed on the computer enabling virtual colour\\ufffd\\ufffdproofing on screen thus saving endless hours of inking in the studio. It is anticipated that further research involving the\\ufffd\\ufffdappointment of a PhD Research student and collaboration with Aberystwyth\\ufffd\\ufffdUniversity Department of Computer Science will lead to the development and\\ufffd\\ufffdtesting of new software that will provide a more effective experience for\\ufffd\\ufffdartists working in this manner. \\ufffd\\ufffd </description> <dc:date>2012-03-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
