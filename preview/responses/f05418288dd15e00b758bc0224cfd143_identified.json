Technological advancements in the present age have assumed such proportions that all&#13; activities are being driven by technology in one form or another. Such is the case in this&#13; information age where it can be considered that effective dissemination of information&#13; can accelerate the learning process and therefore the choice of technology for the&#13; dissemination has some importance.&#13; On a national scale, the target group may be in urban or rural areas, or in both urban and&#13; rural areas. At the present, the choice of technology for this purpose is the Internet. This&#13; is because it combines the speed of transmitting information and the multitasking&#13; functionality of computers hence different sources of information can be accessed&#13; quickly. Computers also provide access to a vast resource of educational materials. The&#13; added advantage of having global connectivity will enable the user in a developing nation&#13; to access developmental information from other nations. To people in developing&#13; countries like Ghana, the process will improve the knowledge base of Ghanaians, and&#13; hence the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds developmental progress.&#13; Dissemination of information may be a problem even in urban areas in a third world&#13; country such as Ghana. It is therefore needful to find a means of communication that is&#13; effective as well as relatively inexpensive that can reach people in both urban and rural&#13; areas. The technology of choice for this purpose is Broadband Powerline Communication&#13; (BPL). The BPL technology combines transmission of power and data along the power&#13; line and that makes the line behave as a traveling wave antenna. The engineers and&#13; technicians who will work on the system will need to be updated in topics that relate to&#13; the system. These are power transmission, data transmission, antenna theory, and&#13; electromagnetic radiation through the radio space. This paper discusses the cooperative&#13; effort between Penn State WilkesBarre&#13; and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and&#13; Technology (KNUST) in Ghana in incorporating local environmental conditions in a&#13; telecommunications program at the baccalaureate level through a student project. This presentation was part of the session : Technology to Support Instructors, Part Two; IACEE 11th World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education; Dr. Willie K. Ofosu is an Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering Technology at&#13; Pennsylvania State University. He teaches telecommunications, wireless systems,&#13; networking, optoelectronics and analog and digital electronics at the WilkesBarre&#13; campus. He is a member of ASEE, IEEE, IET (England) and a Chartered Engineer&#13; (CEng) of England. He is currently involved in international activities in cooperation&#13; with some faculty members at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology&#13; in Ghana. He is an advocate of diversity in the education field. Dr. Ofosu received his&#13; Ph.D. from the Electronic Systems Engineering Department at Essex University in&#13; England. </description> <dc:date>2008-05-21T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Ofosu, Willie K.</dc:creator> <dc:description>Technological advancements in the present age have assumed such proportions that all&#13; activities are being driven by technology in one form or another.

With the strong support and promotion from the&#13; Chinese government, the continuing education in China has evolved into a new&#13; age with new contents, new approaches, new methods, and new achievements&#13; with tremendous vigor and vitality. The paper firstly analyzed both the internal&#13; and the external environments of Chinese continuing education under the&#13; context of economic globalization, and pointed out the opportunities as well as&#13; challenges of continuing education in China. Then the paper elaborated on the&#13; current status and characters of continuing education in China, and took a&#13; detailed discussion on the innovative efforts made in the continuing education&#13; by both the Chinese government and a variety of social organizations,&#13; enterprises, industries, colleges and universities.
