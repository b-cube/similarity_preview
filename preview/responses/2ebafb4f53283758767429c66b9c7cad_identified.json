Transgenics refers to those specific genetic engineering processes that remove genetic material from one species of plant or animal and add it to a different species. Due to the high similarity in genetic sequences for proteins among species, transgenic organisms are able to effectively assimilate and express these trans-genes.</p>  <div class=\"figure center\"><img alt=\"new_mule.jpg\" src=\"/images/new_mule.jpg\" width=\"474\" height=\"317\" /><br/> <p> Figure 1: The mule is a common example of a transgenic organism created when a horse and a donkey mate and produce offspring.

Worthen, Furman University, Biology Department. <br /></p></div>  <div class=\"pullquote\">Transgenics involves removing genetic material from one species and adding it to another.</div>  <p>The process of creating a transgene begins by isolating the gene of interest from a donor organism or selecting for purchase any of the thousands of known genes from massive online genomic databases. Once the gene is obtained, it is usually altered so it can function more effectively or be expressed more readily in the host organism. That gene is then combined with other genetic elements and introduced into a second organism (the host), at which point it&#8217;s known as a transgene. A transgenic organism is further defined as one that contains a transgene introduced by technological methods rather than through selective breeding.  Hybrids are transgenic organisms created when reproductive cells from two species combine to form a single embryo (e.g., a mule is the offspring of a horse and a donkey); on the other hand, chimeras are created by artificially combining genetic material from two organisms into a single species.</p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>The Human Microbiome: A True Story about You and Trillions of Your Closest (Microscopic) Friends</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomics/the_human_microbiome.html\" />     <id>tag:www.actionbioscience.org,2013://234.33465</id>      <published>2013-09-12T00:57:44Z</published>     <updated>2013-10-02T02:18:11Z</updated>      <summary>The human microbiome is composed of the microbes, as well as their genes and genomes, that live in and on the human body.

Scientists are discovering just how important these resident microbes are to our health and well-being, particularly with respect to the roles they play in maintaining our immune systems, contributing to the digestion of our food, and acting as a first line of defense against pathogens. There are many diseases that may be the result of disturbed microbiomes; however, microbiome-based medical treatments and applications are on the horizon.</p>  <div class=\"pullquote\">The human microbiome is composed of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.</div>  <h3>The Human Microbiome: Our Other Genome</h3>  <p>Throughout most of human history we have felt at war with microbes. Bubonic plague, small pox, yellow fever, and typhoid are just a few important examples of historic agents of change, while modern day infectious diseases include malaria, tuberculosis, cholera and HIV/AIDS, to name a few. The scientific study of microbiology, which led to important discoveries such as Louis Pasteur&#8217;s &#8220;germ theory of disease,&#8221; grew out of society&#8217;s desire to conquer these pathogens and eradicate infectious diseases. But a new view is emerging in which the metaphors for war (&#8220;the only good bug is a dead bug&#8221;) are no longer appropriate; instead, we now view humans and microbes as a co-evolved system for the mutual benefit of both the host and resident microbes. But if microbes are germs then how do we benefit from them? In fact, most of the microbes we come in contact with are not germs, but beneficial microbes that digest many things in our diet&#8212;like vegetables&#8212;that we could not digest without microbial enzymes, provide energy for our metabolism, make essential vitamins, and act as a first line of defense against potential pathogens (i.e., germs). Although we use the general term &#8220;microbe,&#8221; which is often thought to be synonymous with bacteria, we now know the human microbiome is primarily composed of bacteria, but also includes numerous and diverse viruses, fungi and protozoa.</p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>On the Importance of Scientific Collections</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/on_the_importance_of_scientific_collections.html\" />     <id>tag:www.actionbioscience.org,2012://234.32406</id>      <published>2013-08-07T01:48:10Z</published>     <updated>2013-08-06T18:38:43Z</updated>      <summary>This new series of special reports by the Natural Science Collections Alliance (NSC Alliance) takes an in depth look at scientists and institutions who are using scientific collections.

These situations challenge and change our ideas of what is considered normal and moral. The emerging concept of xenotransplantation presents challenges, but also opportunities to potentially cure many diseases that otherwise have no treatments or limited treatments.</p>  <div class=\"pullquote\">Xenotransplantation is the transfer of an organ, tissue, or cells from one species to a different species.</div>  <p>Xenotransplantation is the transplantation of an organ or tissue from one species to a different species, and here xenotransplantation refers to <b>the transplantation from a non-human species into a human being</b>. It is curious to consider that in the earliest tales of many cultures we can find the idea of bringing together different animal body parts into one; take for example the Chimera presented in Homer&#8217;s <em>The Odyssey</em>. The Chimera is an animal consisting of the head of a lion fused to parts of a goat and a dragon. Currently, medical science is presenting the very real possibility that people could receive organs transplanted from pigs. In this way, we are witnessing the realization of the Chimera in the form of xenotransplantation.  </p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>Understanding Autism Through Genetics</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/genomics/dougherty.html\" />     <id>tag:www.actionbioscinece.org,2000://234.30075</id>      <published>2013-06-14T15:15:06Z</published>     <updated>2013-11-18T04:29:43Z</updated>      <summary>The genomics revolution has profoundly changed our understanding of autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) over the last decade, which has led not only to better knowledge of the disorder&apos;s complexity but to an expanded list of possible treatment targets.

The data collected by the USGS are not available from other sources and our nation cannot afford to sacrifice this information.</p>  <p>The Ecosystems activity within USGS underpins the agency&#8217;s other science mission areas by providing information needed for understanding the impacts of water use, energy exploration and production, and natural hazards on natural systems.  The USGS conducts research on and monitoring of fish, wildlife, and vegetation - data that informs management decisions by other Interior bureaus regarding protected species and land use.  Biological science programs within the USGS gather long-term data not available from other sources.  The knowledge generated by USGS programs is used by federal and state natural resource managers to maintain healthy and diverse ecosystems while balancing the needs of public use.</p>  <p>Other examples of successful USGS Ecosystem initiatives include:</p>  <ul> <li>Development of comprehensive geospatial data products that characterize the risk of wildfires on all lands in the United States.  These products are used to allocate firefighting resources and to plan fuel reduction projects.</li> <li>Identification of white-nose syndrome, a fungus that is devastating U.S. bat populations and could jeopardize the multi-billion dollar pest control services provided by bats.</li> <li>Identification and evaluation of control measures for Asian carp, sea lamprey, Burmese pythons, and other invasive species that cause billions of dollars in economic losses.</li> <li>Study of the impacts of solar energy and other next generation energy sources on wildlife and endangered species.</li> </ul>  <p>The requested FY 2014 budget would support several important ecosystem science priorities at USGS.  The budget would implement a recommendation by the President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology to integrate information on the condition of U.S. ecosystems.  The budget request would also enable the USGS to develop methodologies to better prevent, detect, and control Asian carp and other invasive species.  USGS would be able to provide enhanced surveillance and diagnostic tools, and develop management tools for white-nose syndrome and other ecologically and economically costly wildlife diseases.  Additionally, USGS would be able to study and better inform decisions about new energy sources.</p>  <p>The request also includes additional funding for water quality research, including in the areas of fisheries and contaminant biology.  The budget would support development of a new system for access and use of water budget information.  A central part of this new initiative is streamflow information collected by USGS&#8217; national network of streamgages.</p>  <p>Through the Cooperative Research Units, the USGS and their partners address pressing issues facing natural resource managers at the local, state, and federal levels.  Examples of recent research initiatives include studying the effects of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on wildlife and fisheries, and improving management of elk and waterfowl.  In addition to providing research expertise, these partnerships at 40 universities in 38 states serve as important training centers for America&#8217;s next generation of scientists and resource managers.  More than 500 graduate students each year receive training at Cooperative Research Units.  The program is also an efficient use of resources: each federal dollar invested in the program is leveraged more than three-fold.  A modest increase is proposed for FY 2014.</p>  <p>Although the proposed budget supports many USGS priorities, the requested funding level would result in $36.6 million in cuts to programs that support agency core missions.  The agency proposed these reductions to offset increases in fixed costs and to attain greater cost efficiencies.</p>  <p>In summary, the USGS is uniquely positioned to provide a scientific context for many of the nation&#8217;s biological and environmental challenges, including water quality and use, energy independence, and conservation of biological diversity.  This array of research expertise not only serves the core missions of the Department of the Interior, but also contributes to management decisions made by other agencies and private sector organizations.  USGS science is also cost-effective, as the agency&#8217;s activities help to identify the most effective management actions.  In short, increased investments in these important research activities will yield dividends.</p>  <p><strong>U.S. Forest Service</strong></p>  <p>United States Forest Service research provides scientific information and new technologies to support sustainable management of the nation&#8217;s forests and rangelands.  These products and services increase the basic biological and physical knowledge of the composition, structure, and function of forest, rangeland, and aquatic ecosystems.</p>  <p>The FY 2014 budget request would support key areas of scientific research, the outcomes of which will inform sustainable management of the nation&#8217;s forests and rangelands.  USFS&#8217; research on wildland fire and fuels evaluates the effectiveness of hazardous fuels treatments and helps managers as they protect life and property and restore fire-adapted ecosystems.  Research would also continue on priority invasive species, such as emerald ash borer and hemlock wooly adelgid, which have caused extensive damage to forests and local economies.</p>  <p><strong>Environmental Protection Agency</strong></p>  <p>The Office of Research and Development (ORD) supports valuable extramural and intramural research that is used to identify and mitigate environmental problems facing our nation.  ORD research informs decisions made by public health and safety managers, natural resource managers, businesses, and other stakeholders concerned about air and water pollution, human health, and land management and restoration.  In short, ORD provides the scientific basis upon which EPA monitoring and enforcement programs are built.</p>  <p>Despite the important role played by ORD, its funding has declined by 28.5 percent in Gross Domestic Product-indexed dollars since FY 2004, when it peaked at $646.5 million.  &#8220;This long-term decline has limited and will continue to limit the research that can be conducted to support the agency&#8217;s effort to protect human health and the environment,&#8221; according to the EPA&#8217;s Science Advisory Board.  &#8220;These limitations pose a vulnerability for EPA at a time when the agency faces significant science questions with long-term implications for protecting the environment and public health.&#8221;</p>  <p>At $554.1 million, the budget request for FY 2014 falls far short of addressing past and current shortfalls.  We ask that Congress restore funding for ORD to at least the FY 2010 enacted level.</p>  <p>The Ecosystem Services Research program within ORD is responsible for enhancing, protecting, and restoring ecosystem services, such as clean air and water, rich soil for crop production, pollination, and flood control.  The program has been long underfunded, according to the EPA Science Advisory Board, with a 58 percent budget decline over the last decade.  We ask that Congress address the chronic underfunding of the program.</p>  <p>The Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program supports valuable research on human health and the environment through competitively awarded research grants.  The program enables EPA to fill information gaps that are not addressed by intramural EPA research programs or by other federal agencies.</p>  <p>Two valuable training opportunities for the next generation of scientists will be removed from EPA as part of a proposed government-wide consolidation of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education programs.  Funding would be zeroed out for EPA STAR graduate fellowships and Greater Research Opportunities undergraduate fellowships.  The Science Advisory Board &#8220;considers it a priority to increase STAR fellowships, if possible, because support for environmental scientists at an early stage in their careers is a cost-effective way to advance ORD&#8217;s strategic goals.&#8221;  The National Academy of Sciences called the fellowship &#8220;a valuable mechanism for enabling a continuing supply of graduate students in environmental sciences and engineering.&#8221;  We are concerned that the consolidation of these programs at the National Science Foundation will be detrimental to preparation of the next generation of environmental scientists and engineers.  We ask for the program to remain at EPA and to be supported at an adequate funding level.</p>  <p>ORD&#8217;s Safe and Sustainable Water Resources program supports research that underpins safe drinking water for society.  The program&#8217;s research also focuses on better understanding resiliency of watersheds to stressors and factors that affect watershed restoration.  The budget request would allow the program to pursue research that will inform decisions about water safety and to ensure the sustainability of our wetlands.</p>  <p>In conclusion, we urge Congress to restore funding for the ORD to the FY 2010 enacted level.  These appropriation levels would allow ORD to address a backlog of research needs.</p>  <p>Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this request.</p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>AIBS Report on the President&apos;s 2014 Budget </title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/science_policy/aibs_report_on_the_presidents_2014_budget.html\" />     <id>tag:www.actionbioscience.org,2013://234.33378</id>      <published>2013-04-30T17:40:19Z</published>     <updated>2013-08-06T17:42:24Z</updated>      <summary>Click here to read the PDF....</summary>     <author>         <name>Julie Palakovich Carr</name>              </author>              <category term=\"1-funding for the biological sciences\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"science policy\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />               <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/\">         <![CDATA[<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.aibs.org/public-policy/resources/AIBS_Budget_Report_FY2014.pdf\">Click here</a> to read the PDF.</strong></p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>AIBS Submits Testimony in Support of the NSF 2014 Budget</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/science_policy/aibs_submits_testimony_to_the_senate_in_support_of_the_nsf_fy_2014_budget.html\" />     <id>tag:www.actionbioscience.org,2013://234.33377</id>      <published>2013-04-19T17:37:23Z</published>     <updated>2013-08-06T17:44:44Z</updated>      <summary>Outside Witness Testimony in Support of FY 2014 Funding for the National Science Foundation Submitted by: Julie Palakovich Carr Senior Public Policy Associate and Robert Gropp, Ph.D. Director of Public Policy American Institute of Biological Sciences 1444 I Street, NW, Suite 200 Washington, DC 20005 Phone: 202-628-1500 Fax: 202-628-1509 Submitted to: Senate Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies The American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS) appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony in support of fiscal year (FY) 2014 appropriations for the National Science Foundation (NSF).

We encourage Congress to provide NSF with at least $7.626 billion in FY 2014.</p>  <p>The AIBS is a nonprofit scientific association dedicated to advancing biological research and education for the welfare of society.  AIBS works to ensure that the public, legislators, funders, and the community of biologists have access to and use information that will guide them in making informed decisions about matters that require biological knowledge.  Founded in 1947 as a part of the National Academy of Sciences, AIBS became an independent, member-governed organization in the 1950s.  Today, AIBS has nearly 160 member organizations and is headquartered in Reston, Virginia, with a Public Policy Office in Washington, DC.</p>  <p><strong>NSF and Innovation</strong></p>  <p>The NSF is an important engine that helps power our nation&#8217;s economic growth.  Through its competitive, peer-reviewed research grants, NSF supports the development of new knowledge that will help to solve the most challenging problems facing society, and will lead to new scientific discoveries, patents, and jobs.  The agency&#8217;s education and training programs are helping to ensure that the next generation has the scientific, technical, and mathematical skills employers are seeking.  Investments in research equipment and facilities enable the country to continue to innovate and compete globally.</p>  <p>These efforts, however, require a sustained federal investment.  Unpredictable swings in federal funding can disrupt research programs, create uncertainty in the research community, and stall the development of the next great idea.</p>  <p>NSF is a sound investment that pays dividends.  The use of peer-review to evaluate and select the best proposals means that NSF is funding the highest quality research.</p>  <p>The research supported by NSF is unique from the science funded by other federal programs.  Unlike most federal agencies, which focus on applied research, NSF supports basic research that advances the frontiers of our knowledge about biodiversity, genetics, physiology, and ecosystems.  Recent discoveries that stem from NSF-funded research include:</p>  <ul> <li>Development of a robotic fish that mimics live fish behavior.  The robot could be used to lead schools of real fish away from dangers such as turbines or oil spills.</li> <li>Identification of the mechanisms that keep natural structures, like plant leaves and butterfly wings, clean.  This information could be used to prevent fouling of human-made structures.</li> <li>Calculation of the impact of bark beetle infestations on a forest&#8217;s ability to store carbon dioxide.  This new method can also be used to assess other economic impacts of forest loss.</li> <li>Discovery of the key proteins and enzymes in an insect&#8217;s outer shell, and identification of which proteins break down easily.  These insights could be used to create more effective pest control strategies.</li> </ul>  <p><strong>Biological Sciences Directorate</strong></p>  <p>The NSF is the primary federal funding source for basic biological research at our nation&#8217;s universities and colleges.  The NSF provides approximately 64% of extramural federal support for non-medical, fundamental biological and environmental research at academic institutions.</p>  <p>The Biological Sciences Directorate (BIO) funds research in the foundational disciplines within biology.  These fields of study further our understanding of how organisms and ecosystems function.  Additionally, BIO supports innovative interdisciplinary research that improves our understanding of how human social systems influence - or are influenced by - the environment, such as the NSF-wide Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability program.  In collaboration with NSF&#8217;s engineering and math and physical sciences directorates, BIO is working to develop new, cutting-edge research fields.  For example, the BioMaPS program is accelerating understanding of biological systems, and applying that knowledge to new technologies in clean energy.</p>  <p>Equally important, BIO provides essential support for our nation&#8217;s place-based biological research, such as field stations and natural science collections.  The Long-Term Ecological Research program supports fundamental ecological research over long time periods and large spatial scales, the results of which provide information necessary for the identification and resolution of environmental problems.</p>  <p>The FY 2014 budget request would also sustain an effort to digitize high priority specimens in U.S. natural science collections.  This investment will help the scientific community ensure access to and appropriate curation of irreplaceable biological specimens and associated data, and stimulate the development of new computer hardware and software, digitization technologies, and database management tools.</p>  <p>The Dimensions of Biodiversity program supports cross-disciplinary research to describe and understand the scope and role of life on Earth.  Despite centuries of discovery, most of our planet&#8217;s biodiversity remains unknown.  This lack of knowledge is particularly troubling given the rapid and permanent loss of global biodiversity.  A better understanding of life on Earth will help us to make new bio-based discoveries in the realms of food, fiber, fuel, pharmaceuticals, and bio-inspired innovation.</p>  <p>The Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction account is funding the construction of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON).  Once completed, NEON will provide the infrastructure necessary to collect data across the United States on the effects of climate change, land use change, water use, and invasive species on natural resources and biodiversity.  This information will be valuable to scientists, resource managers, and government decision makers as they seek to better understand and manage natural systems.</p>  <p><strong>STEM Education</strong></p>  <p>NSF plays a central role in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education.  Support for the scientific training of undergraduate and graduate students is critically important to our research enterprise.  Students recruited into science through NSF programs and research experiences are our next generation of innovators and educators.  In short, NSF grants are essential to the nation&#8217;s goal of sustaining our global leadership in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, and reigniting our economic engines.</p>  <p>NSF&#8217;s education initiatives support STEM education innovation from elementary school through post-graduate.  The Graduate Research Fellowship program is an important part of our national effort to recruit and retain the best and brightest STEM students.  The Faculty Early Career Development program (CAREER) supports young faculty who are dedicated to integrating research with teaching and learning.</p>  <p>Major changes to STEM education programs are proposed in the NSF FY 2014 budget request.  We appreciate the need for efficient and effective government programs, especially in light of the current fiscal situation.  We are concerned, however, that implementation of these changes will proceed before the full details are known.  Given the considerable consequences for student education and training, we hope that Congress will provide careful consideration of the potential impacts to our nation&#8217;s pipeline of researchers and STEM-skilled workers.</p>  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>  <p>Continued investments in the biological sciences are critical.  Sustained support for NSF will help spur economic growth and innovation, and continue to build scientific capacity at a time when our nation is at risk of being outpaced by our global competitors.  Please support an investment of at least $7.626 billion for NSF for FY 2014.</p>  <p>Thank you for your thoughtful consideration of this request and for your prior efforts on behalf of science and the National Science Foundation.</p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>Ethical Issues in Pharmacogenetics</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/ethical_issues_in_pharmacogenetics.html\" />     <id>tag:www.actionbioscience.org,2013://234.33078</id>      <published>2013-04-10T00:20:54Z</published>     <updated>2013-05-21T00:18:14Z</updated>      <summary>Understanding the influence of heritability on an individual&apos;s drug metabolism helps medical practitioners improve patient outcomes and reduce adverse drug events.

Understanding the influence of heritability on an individual&#8217;s drug metabolism offers the potential to identify which drug, and at what dose, is likely to be safest and most effective for a particular individual, which helps medical practitioners improve patient outcomes as well as reduce adverse drug events (ADEs). </p>  <div class=\"pullquote\">Pharmacogenetics offers medical practitioners the ability to more accurately customize medicine dosages.</div>  <p>Currently, the majority of medicines are taken in dosages determined by patient age (pediatric versus adult), weight, and other clinical factors. In many instances, these criteria are proving to be inadequate to ensure that a medicine will be safe and effective for a particular individual. Pharmacogenetics promises to take the guesswork out of prescribing safe and effective drugs. However, the use of pharmacogenetics in both clinical research and medical practice poses various ethical concerns.  While these concerns are common to the fields of both genetics and genomics, they are nonetheless also relevant to pharmacogenetics.

Ford 2300 N. Lincoln Blvd., Rm. 424A Oklahoma City, OK 73105 Dear Senator Ford: On behalf of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), I write to urge your active opposition to SB 758, the &#8220;Oklahoma Science Education Act.&#8221; This legislation is bad for science and bad for science education and should not be enacted into law. Scientists in Oklahoma are deeply concerned about this legislation and the negative message it sends to the rest of the country. The best and brightest scientists, whether working for a university, teaching in a K-12 classroom, or working for a private sector company, want to work in an environment that appreciates the nature of science, not one that periodically redefines science in service to political agendas.

Lincoln Blvd., Rm. 424A<br /> Oklahoma City, OK 73105</p>  <p>Dear Senator Ford:</p>  <p>On behalf of the American Institute of Biological Sciences (AIBS), I write to urge your active opposition to SB 758, the &#8220;Oklahoma Science Education Act.&#8221;  This legislation is bad for science and bad for science education and should not be enacted into law.</p>  <p>Scientists in Oklahoma are deeply concerned about this legislation and the negative message it sends to the rest of the country.  The best and brightest scientists, whether working for a university, teaching in a K-12 classroom, or working for a private sector company, want to work in an environment that appreciates the nature of science, not one that periodically redefines science in service to political agendas.</p>   <p>The economy and jobs of the future, whether in manufacturing, research and development, or energy and aerospace, require workers who have an understanding of scientific concepts and are practiced at thinking scientifically.  This requires a quality science education, one free of political mandates.  If enacted, SB 758 would merely offer a vehicle for advocates of particular political or religious belief systems to introduce their personal ideologies into the science curriculum.</p>  <p>This legislation is similar to measures supported by advocates for creationism in other states.  Advocates for this and similar legislation often assert that evolution and climate change are controversial subjects.  Any controversy is purely political.  There is no legitimate scientific controversy about evolution or climate change.  Scientists have, and continue to, empirically test these concepts and with each test the evidence grows stronger and our understanding more thorough.</p>  <p>We urge you to respect science, science teachers, and religion by opposing passage of SB 758 from the Senate Education Committee.</p>  <p>Sincerely,</p>  <p>Richard T.

Newspapers report the wonders such genetic knowledge can bring, but less often the threats for which these &#8220;advances&#8221; are also responsible.  In reality, the ability to identify people and determine elements of their genetic profiles has significant downsides.</p>  <p>The dominant ideology in Western society holds that the only problems caused by technologies are either unintended side effects or abuses. However, technologies are not designed to benefit all segments of society equally.  Because of their size, scale, and requirements for capital investments and knowledge, modern technologies can allow already-powerful groups to consolidate their powers. </p> ]]>               </content> </entry>  </feed> ",
