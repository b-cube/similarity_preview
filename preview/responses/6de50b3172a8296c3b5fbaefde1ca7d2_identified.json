These point cloud files             contain all the original lidar points collected, with the original spatial reference and units preserved. These data may have             been used as the source of updates to the National Elevation Dataset (NED), which serves as the elevation layer of the National             Map. Lidar (Light detection and ranging) discrete-return point cloud data are available in the American Society for             Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) LAS format. The LAS format is a standardized binary format for storing 3-dimensional             point cloud data and point attributes along with header information and variable length records specific to the data. Millions             of data points are stored as a 3-dimensional data cloud as a series of geo-referenced x, y coordiniates and z (elevation), as             well as other attributes for each point. A few older projects in this collection are in ASCII format. Please refer to             http://www.asprs.org/Committee-General/LASer-LAS-File-Format-Exchange-Activities.html for additional information on the .LAS             file format. </abstract>          <purpose>High-resolution digital elevation data generated by airborne lidar have led to significant advances in geomorphology, the             branch of geoscience concerned with the origin and evolution of Earth's surface topography. Lidar provides unique             characteristics relative to other remotely sensed data sources by providing three-dimensional feature information that cannot be             derived from traditional imaging sensors. Lidar data serves as a source of data for the elevation layer of The National Map, and             provides surface information for earth science studies and mapping applications in the United States. The data are utilized by             the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring,             visualization, and other applications.</purpose>          <supplinf> Each individual lidar project is tiled. Individual tiles which cover an area of interest can be downloaded. Projects may             overlap, however, no mosaicking or merging has been performed has occurred. When projects overlap, tiled .LAS data from each             project should be available..... Most .LAS files in this collection are classified, though no guarantee or claims of accuracy             are made against the data. The geographic area of coverage for this collection is limited to areas of where lidar data are             available. Additional information for the NED may be found on http://ned.usgs.gov/. Data may be downloaded through The National             Map Viewer: http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html.
