The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information.  This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. </abstract><purpose> SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. </purpose><supplinf> Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be available from the primary organization listed in the Point of Contact. </supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>19980827</begdate><enddate>20061211</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-74.234</westbc><eastbc>-73.887</eastbc><northbc>41.326</northbc><southbc>40.997</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>soil survey</themekey><themekey>soils</themekey><themekey>Soil Survey Geographic</themekey><themekey>SSURGO</themekey></theme><place><placekt>USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</placekt><placekey>New York</placekey><placekey>Rockland County</placekey><placekey>Haverstraw Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Nyack Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Park Ridge Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Peekskill Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Popolopen Lake Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Ramsey Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Sloatsburg Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Thiells Quadrangle</placekey><placekey>Yonkers Quadrangle</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst> The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.  This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.  Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data. </useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>State Soil Scientist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>USDA - Natural Resources Conservation Service</address><address>New York State Office</address><address>The Galleries of Syracuse, 5th Floor, Suite 354</address><address>441 South Salina Street</address><city>Syracuse</city><state>NY</state><postal>13202</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>315-477-6521</cntvoice><cnttdd>(202) 720-2600</cnttdd><cntemail>steven.indrick@ny.usda.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr> Attribute accuracy is tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system. Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s). </attraccr></attracc><logic> Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.  The quadrangles in this soil survey are edgematched to quadrangles in the adjacent SSURGO certified soil surveys, Westchester County, and Orange County New York, and Passaic and Bergan Counties, New Jersey, and the soil survey area boundaries match.  Most feature edges (polygon and line segments) match adjacent ones in the edge matched soil survey area, however, most feature labels don't match the adjacent feature labels in the edge matched soil survey. </logic><complete> A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified on the map is a delineation.  Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map.  A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas (map unit components), each with a designated range in proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little or no recognizable soil.  Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995, USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.  The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups.  Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.  Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether complex or association is used in the name. The major components of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In either case, because the major components are sufficiently different in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association, each major component is normally present though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.  Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that are not consistently associated geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in the same map delineation. These components are included in the same named map unit because their use and management are the same or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations.  Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend, one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per 3,000 acres.  A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about 5 acres. </complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar> The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000 feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units.  For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch. </horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin> U.S. Department of

Four control points corresponding to the four corners on the 7.5 minute quadrangle were used for registration during data collection. The data were sent to the Soils Information Systems Laboratory, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. The county boundaries were manually digitized from the 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles in LT4X Version 4.02. The special soil features data were manually digitized off the topographic quadrangles in GRASS Version 4.13 at a resolution of at least 0.01 inch. The data were created and maintained in the North American Datum of 1927. Checkplots of the soils and special soil features data were reviewed by soil scientists at Syracuse, New York. The digital files were exported to GRASS Version 4.13 using the v.export command. Once in GRASS, the digital files were created as Digital Line Graph-3 Optional format files using the v.out.dlg command. The digital data were sent to the Wisconsin Digitizing Unit, Madison, Wisconsin. The digital files were evaluated with the February 1998 ARC/INFO SSURGO Evaluation AMLs provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, National Cartography and Geospatial Center, Fort Worth, Texas. Upon successful completion of the SSURGO Evaluation, the new DLGs were rechecked with the February 1998 AMLs.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The map unit key is used to link to information in the National Soil Information System tables.  Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil Information System database. This attribute database gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation, agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.  The National Soil Information System database contains static metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these database objects. Attributes include table and column descriptions and detailed domain information.  The National Soil Information System database also contains a distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed data.  Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area. </eaover><eadetcit> Soil Taxonomy: A basic system of soil classification for making and interpreting soil surveys.
