The strata were created from the multivariate analysis of 75 environmental variables, including climatic data, topographic data, human geographical features and geology data.  The Land Classification has provided a stratification for successive ecological surveys (the Countryside Survey of Great Britain), the results of which have characterised the classes in terms of botanical, zoological and landscape features.  Additionally, the Land Classification can be used to stratify a wide range of ecological and biogeographical surveys to improve the efficiency of collection, analysis and presentation of information derived from a sample.  There are three versions of the Classification available. 1. The 1990 version containing 32 classes, which was the first to classify all 240,000km squares in Great Britain (building on an earlier 1978 version based on a sample of squares only).  2. A 1998 version, when the Land Classification was adjusted to 40 classes as a consequence of the need to provide National Estimates (from Countryside Survey 2000) for habitats for Scotland in addition to GB as a whole. 3. In 2007, the Land Classification was adjusted once again, to 45 classes, as a consequence of the need to provide Wales-only estimates in addition to those for Scotland and GB as a whole (from Countryside Survey 2007).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Bio-geographical regions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land classification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ITE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Institute of Terrestrial Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-05T13:34:37Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5f0605e4-aa2a-48ab-b47c-bf5510823e8f\">     <title>ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 2007</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5f0605e4-aa2a-48ab-b47c-bf5510823e8f</link>     <description>The surface of Great Britain (GB) varies continuously in land cover from one area to another. The objective of any environmentally based land classification is to produce classes that match the patterns that are present by helping to define clear boundaries. The more appropriate the analysis and data used, the better the classes will fit the natural patterns. The observation of inter-correlations between ecological factors is the basis for interpreting ecological patterns in the field, and the ITE Land Classification formalises such subjective ideas.   The data inevitably comprise a large number of factors in order to describe the environment adequately. Single factors, such as altitude, would only be useful on a national basis if they were the only dominant causative agent of ecological variation.  The ITE Land Classification has defined 32 environmental categories called land classes, initially based on a sample of 1-km squares in Great Britain but subsequently extended to all 240 000 1-km squares. The original classification was produced using multivariate analysis of 75 environmental variables. The extension to all squares in GB was performed using a combination of logistic discrimination and discriminant functions. The classes have provided a stratification for successive ecological surveys, the results of which have characterised the classes in terms of botanical, zoological and landscape features.  The classification has also been applied to integrate diverse datasets including satellite imagery, soils and socio-economic information. A variety of models have used the structure of the classification, for example to show potential land use change under different economic conditions.  This 2007 version of the Land Classification was adjusted from the 1998 and 1990 versions (see separate records) as a consequence of the need to provide National Estimates for habitats for Scotland and Wales in addition to GB as a whole. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Bio-geographical regions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land classification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>stratification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ITE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Institute of Terrestrial Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-10-16T14:05:37Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/971671a6-98b4-4d80-b165-21dace7373b9\">     <title>ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 1998</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/971671a6-98b4-4d80-b165-21dace7373b9</link>     <description>The surface of Great Britain (GB) varies continuously in land cover from one area to another.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 256 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey and scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as percent habitat per 1km square.   The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside.  The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares.  The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time.  In addition to habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, linear habitat, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03689</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-04-18T10:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
