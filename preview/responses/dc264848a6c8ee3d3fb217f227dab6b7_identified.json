Mexican children have been shown to consume limited amounts of fruit and vegetables. The purpose of the current study is to determine whether the inclusion of eggs in the diet increases plasma carotenoids in this population. Study Design: This study is a follow up on the effects of high egg intake on plasma lipids and atherogenic lipoproteins in children. Fifty four Mexican children (25 boys/29 girls) aged 8-12 y were randomly assigned to consume either 2 eggs/d (518 mg additional dietary cholesterol) (EGG period) or the equivalent amount of egg whites (SUB Period) in a cross-over design for 4 wk. After a 3 wk washout, children were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Methodology: 3-day dietary records, plasma carotenoids and apolipoproteins were measured at the end of the EGG and SUB Periods. Results: In agreement with the lack of effects of eggs in increasing atherogenic lipoprotein profiles, plasma apolipoprotein B concentrations did not change between periods indicating that increases in plasma cholesterol were not associated with higher number of LDL particles. Although the values for apo C-III were high compared to other pediatric populations, they were not affected by egg intake. Dietary records indicated low intake of carotenoids, especially during the SUB period. Plasma lutein and zeaxanthin were increased during the EGG period from 0.235 &amp;plusmn; 0.071 to 0.280 &amp;plusmn; 0.147 &amp;mu;mol/L (P&amp;lt;0.001) and 0.044 &amp;plusmn; 0.019 to 0.051 &amp;plusmn; 0.031 &amp;mu;mol/L (P&amp;lt;0.001), respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that the eggs are a good source of lutein and zeaxanthin in this population and that the increases in LDL size during the egg period may also be related to a better transport of these carotenoids in plasma.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:publisher/><dc:date>2013-07-23</dc:date><dc:source>http://zenodo.org/record/8067</dc:source><dc:doi>10.5281/zenodo.8067</dc:doi><dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8067</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8067</dc:identifier></dc:dc>   </collection>",
