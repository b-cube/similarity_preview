No ancient source, in fact, lists the powers that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> acquired after the reforms of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>, but it is possible to make some educated guesses.</p>  <p>We know that the original <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, as <name type=\"person\">Solon</name> set it up, existed <quote>to deliberate before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref>, and nothing was to be brought before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> without an initial resolution of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref></quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ou(\\\\s probouleu/ein e)/tace tou= dh/mou kai\\\\ mhde\\  e)a=n a)probou/leuton ei)s e)kklhsi/an ei)sfe/resqai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut.

This is the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>&#8217;s <soCalled>probouleutic</soCalled> function, the function of <soCalled>planning beforehand.</soCalled> In the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">fourth century</dateRange>, on the other hand, we see that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> functioned like a court of law or a court of inquiry under certain circumstances, conducting trials of state prosecution (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ei)saggeli/ai</foreign>) and conducting audits of public officials (<foreign lang=\"grc\">dokimasi/ai</foreign>)&#8212;these functions are described with citations to the ancient evidence elsewhere in this article and the article on the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">institution of the Council</xref>, but several <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-400\">5th century</dateRange> examples of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> conducting state prosecutions (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ei)saggeli/ai</foreign>) appear in a speech by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Antiphon</name> from <date value=\"-412\">412 BCE</date> (<bibl author=\"Antiphon\" work=\"Antiph. 6\" n=\"Antiph. 6.35\">Antiph. 6.35</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Antiphon\" work=\"Antiph. 6\" n=\"Antiph. 6.49\">Antiph. 6.49</bibl>).</p>  <p>Since <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> says that the authority to <quote>safeguard the laws</quote> passed from the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">Courts</xref> with the reforms of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 25.2\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 25.2</bibl>), and since the authority to conduct state prosecutions and audits must have been granted to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> at some point, we might suppose that these judicial functions were added to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>&#8217;s probouleutic function in <date value=\"-462\">462/1 BCE</date>.</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> connects this event to a newfound feeling of power among the common people of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> following the Persian Wars, when the less wealthy citizens by serving in the navy had saved the city. He makes the connection between naval victories and the reform of the Court of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> explicitly in his <title>Politics</title> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

Also, by <date value=\"-462\">462 BCE</date>, when <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> made his reforms, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">archons</xref> (the future members of the Court of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>) were chosen by lot, not by vote (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22.5\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 22.5</bibl>). It is possible that this change made the institution seem less prestigious, and thus worthy of holding fewer powers <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">This interesting suggestion is from <bibl primary=\"NO\">P.J. Rhodes, <title>A Commentary on the Aristotelian <title>Athenaion Politeia</title></title> (Oxford, 1993)</bibl></note>.</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> maintains that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> lost power as <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> became more democratic, while Rhodes suggests that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> lost power as it became, itself, less aristocratic. There is no reason why both of these causes could not have influenced the Athenians&#8217; willingness to shift power from the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, but the ancient theory of <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> and the modern theory of Rhodes offer a convincing symmetry.</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"History5thc\" n=\"History5thc\"> <head>The 5th Century BCE</head>  <p>Most of our evidence regarding the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> comes from the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange>, the speeches by Attic orators (see <name type=\"genreDescription\">Oratory</name>) and <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name>&#8217;s <title>Constitution of the Athenians</title>(<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title></bibl>). But our sources give us a few interesting anecdotes that illustrate the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> in action, as well as some descriptions of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>&#8217;s role in the crises that the Athenian democracy faced during its first 100 years.</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Diodorus</name> Siculus gives an anecdote that shows the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> conducting foreign policy in the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-475\">early 5th century</dateRange>. He says that after the Persian Wars, when the Athenians were planning to fortify their city, the Spartans urged them not to build walls (<bibl author=\"Diodorus\" work=\"Diod.\" n=\"Diod. 11.39.4\">Diod. 11.39.4</bibl>). <quote>While the Athenians were at a loss what they should do, <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name>, who enjoyed at that time the highest favour among them, advised them to take no action; for he warned them that if they had recourse to force, the Lacedaemonians <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">that is, the <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Spartans</placeName></note> could easily march up against them together with the Peloponnesians and prevent them from fortifying the city. But he told the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> in confidence that he and certain others would go as ambassadors to Lacedaemon to explain the matter of the wall to the Lacedaemonians; and he instructed the magistrates <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">archons</xref>, <foreign lang=\"grc\">toi=s de\\\\ a)/rxousi</foreign></note>, when ambassadors should come from <placeName key=\"Lacedaemon\">Lacedaemon</placeName> to <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, to detain them until he himself should return from <placeName key=\"Lacedaemon\">Lacedaemon</placeName>, and in the meantime to put the whole population to work fortifying the city. In this manner, he declared to them, they would achieve their purpose.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Diodorus\" work=\"Diod.\" n=\"Diod. 11.39.5\">Diod. 11.39.5</bibl>).</p>  <p>This function of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, as a body that was democratic, like the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, but also able to keep secrets, because of its smaller size and indoor meetings, appears in another anecdote from <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Diodorus</name>. Here, <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> has plans to fortify the <placeName key=\"Piraeus\">Piraeus</placeName>, the harbor of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>. We can see from the passage that the Athenians were worried not only about their (potential) enemies, the Lacedaimonians (another name for the Spartans), but about <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name>&#8217; own intentions; was he aiming to become tyrant? The Athenians wanted to know what <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> was up to, but did not want the whole world to know what <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> was up to. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Diodorus</name> describes the solution:</p>  <p><quote>Now as <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> pondered these matters, he decided that he should not make public announcement of his plan, knowing with certainty that the Lacedaemonians would endeavour to stop it; and so he announced to the citizens in <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> that he wished both to advise upon and to introduce important matters which were also to the advantage of the city. But what these matters were, he added, it was not in the public interest to state openly, but it was fitting that a few men should be charged with putting them into effect; and he therefore asked the people to select two men in whom they had the greatest confidence and to entrust to them to pass upon the matter in question. The people acceded to his advice, and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> chose two men, <name type=\"person\">Aristeides</name> and <name type=\"person\">Xanthippus</name>, selecting them not only because of their upright character, but also because they saw that these men were in active rivalry with <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> for glory and leadership and were therefore opposed to him. These men heard privately from <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> about his plan and then declared to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> that what <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> had disclosed to them was of great importance, was to the advantage of the state, and was feasible. The people admired the man and at the same time harboured suspicions of him, lest it should be with the purpose of preparing some sort of tyranny for himself that he was embarking upon plans of such magnitude and importance, and they urged him to declare openly what he had decided upon. But he made the same reply, that it was not to the interests of the state that there should be a public disclosure of his intentions. Thereupon the people were far the more amazed at the man&#8217;s shrewdness and greatness of mind, and they urged him to disclose his ideas secretly to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, assuring him that, if that body decided that what he said was feasible and advantageous, then they would advise it to carry his plan to completion. Consequently, when the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> learned all the details and decided that what he said was for the advantage of the state and was feasible, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">people</xref>, without more ado, agreed with the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, and <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name> received authority to do whatever he wished. And every man departed from the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> in admiration of the high character of the man, being also elated in spirit and expectant of the outcome of the plan</quote> (<bibl author=\"Diodorus\" work=\"Diod.\" n=\"Diod. 11.42.1\">Diod. 11.42.1-6</bibl>).</p>  <p>In this instance, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> took two courses of action, one after another. First, it went along with <name type=\"person\">Themistocles</name>&#8217; suggestion by appointing two citizens to confer with him privately and to report their opinion back to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>. But the Athenians still seem to have been uneasy with the idea of acting on the recommendation of only two men. Instead, they took advantage of the nature of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>&#8212;it was fully democratic and included a number of citizens (500 in all, 50 sitting each month), but could also confer in private, away from potentially hostile ears.</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Thucydides</name> tells the story of how the Athenian <name type=\"person\">Alcibiades</name> manipulated the Athenians into forming an alliance with <placeName key=\"Argos\">Argos</placeName> by presenting certain information to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and different information to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> (<bibl author=\"Thucydides\" work=\"Thuc.\" n=\"Thuc. 5.45\">Thuc. 5.45</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut.

This is undemocratic, although a Council is a popular body, for there is bound to be some body of this nature to have the duty of preparing measures for the popular assembly, in order that it may be able to attend to its business; but a preparatory committee, if small, is oligarchical, and Preliminary Councillors must necessarily be few in number, so that they are an oligarchical element. But where both of these magistracies exist, the Preliminary Councillors are in authority over the Councillors, since a councillor is a democratic official, but a preliminary councillor is an oligarchic one. Also the power of the Council is weakened in democracies of the sort in which the people in assembly deals with everything itself.</quote></p>  <p>So, according to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name>&#8217;s understanding of politics in Greek cities, the addition of a board of <soCalled>probouloi,</soCalled> Preliminary Councillors, was an move away from democracy and toward oligarchy.

In this play, produced and performed for an Athenian audience in <date value=\"-411\">411 BCE</date> (source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OCD</title><edition>3</edition></bibl>), there is a character who is one of the Preliminary Councillors (<foreign lang=\"grc\">pro/boulos</foreign>).

If this portrayal of a Preliminary Councillor is at all based on the reality of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> in <date value=\"-411\">411 BCE</date>, it suggests that the Preliminary Councillors had taken over many of the responsibilities formerly belonging to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>: funding the navy, enforcing order, arranging ambassadors.</p>   <p>The events of the year <date value=\"-411\">411 BCE</date> support <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name>&#8217;s assertion that, while the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> was a democratic institution, these Preliminary Councillors leaned toward oligarchy (source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OCD</title><edition>3</edition></bibl>).

In a speech, as reported by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name>, <name type=\"person\">Euryptolemus</name> explained in what way this proposal was illegal, when he asks his fellow Athenians: <quote>What is it, pray, that you fear, that you are in such excessive haste? Do you fear lest you will lose the right to put to death and set free anyone you please if you proceed in accordance with the law, but think that you will retain this right if you proceed in violation of the law, by the method which <name type=\"person\">Callixeinus</name> persuaded the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> to report to the people, that is, by a single vote?</quote> (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.26\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.26</bibl>). If the Athenians want to put the generals on trial they may, <name type=\"person\">Euryptolemus</name> says, but by the legal procedure: <quote>let the men be tried, each one separately, and let the day be divided into three parts, one wherein you shall gather and vote as to whether you judge them guilty or not, another wherein the accusers shall present their case, and another wherein the accused shall make their defence</quote> (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen.

Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.16\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.16-33</bibl>) and putting forward a motion that <quote>the men should each be given a separate trial in accordance with the decree of <name type=\"person\">Cannonus</name></quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">kata\\\\ to\\\\ *kannwnou= yh/fisma kri/nesqai tou\\\\s a)/ndras di/xa e(/kaston</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.34\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.34</bibl>); the decree of <name type=\"person\">Cannonus</name> was the law that governed the trial and punishment of anyone who did harm to the people of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.20\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.20</bibl>). The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> voted in favor of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>&#8217;s original proposal, voted once on the guilt of all eight generals, and the six generals who were in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> were put to death (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.34\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.34</bibl>; for a more condensed version of these events, see <bibl author=\"Diodorus\" work=\"Diod.\" n=\"Diod. 13.101.1\">Diod. 13.101.1-7</bibl>).</p>  <p>In this case, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> clearly failed in its function as a check on the vicissitudes of the larger <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>. The Athenians themselves realized this, according to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name>, who says: <quote>And not long afterwards the Athenians repented, and they voted that complaints (<foreign lang=\"grc\">probolai/</foreign>) be brought against any who had deceived the people, that they provide men to stand as guarantors until such time as they should be brought to trial, and that <name type=\"person\">Callixeinus</name> be included among them</quote> (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.35\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.35</bibl>; <soCalled>probolai</soCalled> were complaints against someone who has allegedly harmed the state and were heard before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>; see  <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 21\" n=\"Dem. 21.193\">Dem. 21.193</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 2\" n=\"Aeschin. 2.145\">Aeschin. 2.145</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Isocrates\" work=\"Isoc. 15\" n=\"Isoc. 15.314\">Isoc. 15.314</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

Pol.</title> 59.2</bibl>). How did the trial of the generals continue after the epistates refused to allow the vote?</p>  <p>There are two possibilities, with no obvious reason to prefer one over the other. First, we might note that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name>&#8217;s account of events includes several clear examples of improper procedure: the generals were not allowed to speak in their own defense for the proper amount of time (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.5\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.5</bibl>); <name type=\"person\">Callixeinus</name> is said to have been bribed to author the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>&#8217;s proposal (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.8\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.8-9</bibl>); his proposal (<foreign lang=\"grc\">gnw/mh</foreign>) was itself illegal (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.9\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.9-10</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.26\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.26</bibl>); <name type=\"person\">Euryptolemus</name> and the others were intimidated into withdrawing their charge of <soCalled>illegal proposal,</soCalled> rather than letting it come to a vote (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.13\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.13</bibl>). Given these irregularities, we could easily imagine that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> simply went ahead with a vote on the guilt of the generals, without the sanction of <name type=\"person\">Socrates</name> the epistates.</p>  <p>The second possibility is this: <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name> tells us at <bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.15\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.15</bibl> that <name type=\"person\">Socrates</name> alone refused to acceed to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>&#8217;s wishes. He then says (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.16\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.16</bibl>) that <quote>after these things</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">meta\\\\ de\\\\ tau=ta</foreign>) <name type=\"person\">Euryptolemus</name> gave a speech (which he quotes), and there was the vote. It is possible that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name>&#8217;s phrase <quote>after these things</quote> is speaking of a delay from one day to the next. On the next day someone else would have been serving as Epistates, since each Epistates served for one day and one night (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 44.1\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 44.1</bibl>).</p>  <p>The affair of the <placeName key=\"Arginousae\">Arginousae</placeName> Generals shows us why the Athenians gave the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> the authority it had over the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>&#8212;even though in this case the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> failed in that role. This affair also shows us an unfortunate side effect of the restoration of democracy after the oligarchic coup of <date value=\"-411\">411</date>. During the proceedings against the generals, the Athenian people gathered in <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> cried out <quote>that it was a terrible thing is anyone should not let the People do whatever they wanted</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">to\\\\ de\\\\ plh=qos e)bo/a deino\\  ei)=nai ei) mh/ tis e)a/sei to\\  dh=mon pra/ttein o(\\\\ a)\\  bou/lhtai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.13\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.13</bibl>). Reacting against the recent oligarchy, the newly restored democracy wanted no limits on its right to act. Only later, when it was too late, did the Athenians realize that they had been mistaken in assuming that an <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, acting without regard to the law and without the calming authority of a democratic <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, could ensure justice (see <bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.35\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.35</bibl>).</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"HistoryThirty\" n=\"HistoryThirty\"> <head>The Tyranny of the Thirty</head>  <p>In <date value=\"-404\">404 BCE</date>, when <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> surrended to <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName>, the government of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref>, imposed on <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> by the Spartans, removed these published laws from the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Stoa Basileios\">Stoa Basileios</name> (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.2\">Lys. 30.2-3</bibl>). <name type=\"person\">Nicomachus</name>, the head of the <soCalled>Law Publishers</soCalled> was later put on trial, accused of manipulating the laws he published and helping the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref> consolidate their power (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.1\">Lys. 30.1-3</bibl>).</p>  <p>Like the Oligarchy of <date value=\"-411\">411</date>, the tyranny of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty</xref> lasted only one year, and after it was overthrown and the city returned to democratic rule, <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> once again compiled and codified its old laws: <quote>On the motion of <name type=\"person\">Teisamenus</name> the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> decreed that <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> be governed as of old, in accordance with the laws of <name type=\"person\">Solon</name>, his weights and his measures, and in accordance with the statutes of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name>, which we used in times past. Such further laws as may be necessary shall be inscribed upon tables by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Legislation\">Nomothetae</xref> elected by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and named hereafter, exposed before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Eponymous Heroes\">Tribal Statutes</xref> for all to see, and handed over to the magistrates during the present month. The laws thus handed over, however, shall be submitted beforehand to the scrutiny of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and the five hundred <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Legislation\">Nomothetae</xref> elected by the Demes, when they have taken their oath. Further, any private citizen who so desires may come before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and suggest improvements in the laws. When the laws have been ratified, they shall be placed under the guardianship of the Council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, to the end that only such laws as have been ratified may be applied by magistrates.

After two anti-democratic revolutions, this law says that in matters of war and peace, death sentences, large fines, disenfranchisement (that is, loss of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"citizenship\">citizenship</xref>), the administration of public finances, and foreign policy the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> cannot act without the approval of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>.</p>  <p>Even with these careful restrictions to its authority the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> was a central institution in the restoration of the government, as the Athenians reestablished their democracy following an oligarchic coup and a tyranny imposed by a conquoring state.
