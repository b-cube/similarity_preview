Since its initial use as pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized regenerative medicine. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed. In this review, the major materials and technology advances within the last five years for each of the common 3D Printing technologies (Three Dimensional Printing, Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, and 3D Plotting/Direct-Write/Bioprinting) are described. Examples are highlighted to illustrate progress of each technology in tissue engineering, and key limitations are identified to motivate future research and advance this fascinating field of advanced manufacturing.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/4</link>                 <dc:creator>Helena Chia</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Benjamin Wu</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2015, null:4</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-03-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/s13036-015-0001-4</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/s13036-015-0001-4-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>4</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-01T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>PDF</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/3\">         <title>Autonomous buckling of micrometer-sized lipid-protein membrane patches constructed by Dictyostelium discoideum</title>         <description>Background: The cytosol of amoeba cells controls the membrane deformation during their motion in vivo. To investigate such ability of the cytosol of amoeba cell, Dictyostelium discoideum (Dictyostelium), in vitro, we used lipids extracted from Dictyostelium and commercially available phospholipids, and prepared substrate-supported lipid membrane patches on the micrometer scale by spin coating. Results: We found that the spin coater holder, which has pores (pore size&#8201;=&#8201;3.1 mm) of negative pressure to hold the cover glass induced the concave surface of the cover glass. The membrane lipid patches were formed at each position in the vicinity of the holder pores and their sizes were in the range of 2.7 to 3.2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;104 &#956;m2. After addition of the cytosol extracted from Dictyostelium to the lipid membrane patches, through time-lapse observation with a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope, we observed an autonomous buckling of the Dictyostelium lipid patches and localized behaviours of proteins found within. Conclusion: The current method serves as the novel technique for the preparation of film patches in which the positions of patches are controlled by the holder pores without fabricating, modifying, and arranging the chemical properties of the solution components of lipids. The findings imply that lipid-binding proteins in the cytosol were adsorbed and accumulated within the Dictyostelium lipid patches, inducing the transformation of the cell-sized patch.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/3</link>                 <dc:creator>Kei Takahashi</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Taro Toyota</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2015, null:3</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-21T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-9-3</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-9-3-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>3</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-21T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/2\">         <title>Molecular cloning using polymerase chain reaction, an educational guide for cellular engineering</title>         <description>Background: Over the last decades, molecular cloning has transformed biological sciences. Having profoundly impacted various areas such as basic science, clinical, pharmaceutical, and environmental fields, the use of recombinant DNA has successfully started to enter the field of cellular engineering. Here, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represents one of the most essential tools. Due to the emergence of novel and efficient PCR reagents, cloning kits, and software, there is a need for a concise and comprehensive protocol that explains all steps of PCR cloning starting from the primer design, performing PCR, sequencing PCR products, analysis of the sequencing data, and finally the assessment of gene expression. It is the aim of this methodology paper to provide a comprehensive protocol with a viable example for applying PCR in gene cloning. Results: Exemplarily the sequence of the tdTomato fluorescent gene was amplified with PCR primers wherein proper restriction enzyme sites were embedded. Practical criteria for the selection of restriction enzymes and the design of PCR primers are explained. Efficient cloning of PCR products into a plasmid for sequencing and free web-based software for the consecutive analysis of sequencing data is introduced. Finally, confirmation of successful cloning is explained using a fluorescent gene of interest and murine target cells. Conclusions: Using a practical example, comprehensive PCR-based protocol with important tips was introduced. This methodology paper can serve as a roadmap for researchers who want to quickly exploit the power of PCR-cloning but have their main focus on functional in vitro and in vivo aspects of cellular engineering.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/2</link>                 <dc:creator>Sayed Shahabuddin Hoseini</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Martin G Sauer</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2015, null:2</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-19T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-9-2</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-9-2-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>2</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-19T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/1\">         <title>TGF-&#223;1 conjugated chitosan collagen hydrogels induce chondrogenic differentiation of human synovium-derived stem cells</title>         <description>Background: Unlike bone tissue, articular cartilage regeneration has not been very successful and has many challenges ahead. We have previously developed injectable hydrogels using photopolymerizable chitosan (MeGC) that supported growth of chondrocytes. In this study, we demonstrate a biofunctional hydrogel for specific use in cartilage regeneration by conjugating transforming growth factor-&#946;1 (TGF-&#946;1), a well-documented chondrogenic factor, to MeGC hydrogels impregnating type II collagen (Col II), one of the major cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Results: TGF-&#946;1 was delivered from MeGC hydrogels in a controlled manner with reduced burst release by chemically conjugating the protein to MeGC. The hydrogel system did not compromise viability of encapsulated human synovium-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hSMSCs). Col II impregnation and TGF-&#946;1 delivery significantly enhanced cellular aggregation and deposition of cartilaginous ECM by the encapsulated cells, compared with pure MeGC hydrogels. Conclusions: This study demonstrates successful engineering of a biofunctional hydrogel with a specific microenvironment tailored to promote chondrogenesis. This hydrogel system can provide promising efficacious therapeutics in the treatment of cartilage defects.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/9/1/1</link>                 <dc:creator>Jinku Kim</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Brian Lin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Soyon Kim</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Bogyu Choi</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Denis Evseenko</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Min Lee</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2015, null:1</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-14T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-9-1</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-9-1-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>1</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-14T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/30\">         <title>Electrospun nanofibers as versatile interfaces for efficient gene delivery</title>         <description>The integration of gene delivery technologies with electrospun nanofibers is a versatile strategy to increase the potential of gene therapy as a key platform technology that can be readily utilized for numerous biomedical applications, including cancer therapy, stem cell therapy, and tissue engineering. As a spatial template for gene delivery, electrospun nanofibers possess highly advantageous characteristics, such as their ease of production, their ECM-analogue nature, the broad range of choices for materials, the feasibility of producing structures with varied physical and chemical properties, and their large surface-to-volume ratios. Thus, electrospun fiber-mediated gene delivery exhibits a great capacity to modulate the spatial and temporal release kinetics of gene vectors and enhance gene delivery efficiency. This review discusses the powerful characteristics of electrospun nanofibers, which can function as spatial interfaces capable of promoting controlled and efficient gene delivery.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/30</link>                 <dc:creator>Slgirim Lee</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Gyuhyung Jin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jae-Hyung Jang</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2014, null:30</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-12-09T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-8-30</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-8-30-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>30</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-09T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/29\">         <title>Blue and UV LED-induced fluorescence in cotton foreign matter</title>         <description>Background: Cotton is an important domesticated fiber used to manufacture a variety of products and industrial goods. During harvesting with cotton strippers and cotton pickers, it is contaminated with foreign matter from botanical and non-botanical sources which adversely affect the quality and consistency of cotton, and therefore reduces its market value. To improve the current grading done by the High Volume Instrument (HVI) and human inspectors, it was explored whether fluorescence imaging can be used for cotton foreign matter detection. Results: Eight types of botanical foreign matter (bark, bract, brown leaf, green leaf, hull, seed coat, seed, stem), and four types of non-botanical foreign matter (paper, twine, plastic bale packaging, plastic bag) were subjected to a fluorescence spectroscopy analysis to determine their optimal excitation and emission wavelength range. Matrix 3D scans were performed in the excitation range from 300 nm to 500 nm, and emission range from 320 nm to 700 nm, and the results indicated the photo-excitable fluorescence in the aforementioned excitation range for all the selected foreign matter categories. Consequently, the blue and the UV LEDs were selected as the excitation sources. The blue LED light provided optimal excitation light for bark, brown leaf, bract, green leaf, hull, and stem, while the UV LED light provided optimal excitation light for paper, plastic bag, plastic packaging, seed, seed coat, and twine. Conclusions: UV and blue light induces fluorescence in 12 types of botanical and non-botanical cotton foreign matter. An imaging apparatus with blue and UV light excitation sources, and a consumer grade SLR camera was successfully developed to capture and characterize fluorescent images of cotton foreign matter. Based on the results, fluorescent imaging could be a promising method for cotton foreign matter detection. Future studies will focus on the classification of cotton foreign matter categories and to further refine the image processing sequence.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/29</link>                 <dc:creator>Adnan Mustafic</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Changying Li</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mark Haidekker</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2014, null:29</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-12-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-8-29</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-8-29-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>29</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-01T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/28\">         <title>The case for decoupling assembly and submission standards to maintain a more flexible registry of biological parts</title>         <description>The Registry of Standard Biological Parts only accepts genetic parts compatible with the RFC 10 BioBrick format. This combined assembly and submission standard requires that four unique restriction enzyme sites must not occur in the DNA sequence encoding a part. We present evidence that this requirement places a nontrivial burden on iGEM teams developing large and novel parts. We further argue that the emergence of inexpensive DNA synthesis and versatile assembly methods reduces the utility of coupling submission and assembly standards and propose a submission standard that is compatible with current quality control strategies while nearly eliminating sequence constraints on submitted parts.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/28</link>                 <dc:creator>Razan Alnahhas</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ben Slater</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Yunle Huang</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Catherine Mortensen</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jordan Monk</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Yousef Okasheh</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Marco Howard</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Neil Gottel</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Michael Hammerling</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jeffrey Barrick</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2014, null:28</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-12-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-8-28</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-8-28-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>28</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-01T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/27\">         <title>Correction: A fibrin/hyaluronic acid hydrogel for the delivery of mesenchymal stem cells and potential for articular cartilage repair</title>         <description>The authors would like to add the following detail to the Competing Interests and Acknowledgments stated in the published article [1] &quot;At the time of writing, TNS and RCD were employees of Regenerative Sciences, LLC.

Together with cell differentiation, these mechanisms allow populations of cells to organize themselves into defined geometries and structures, as simple embryos develop into complex organisms. The control of tissue morphogenesis by populations of engineered cells is a potentially very powerful but neglected aspect of synthetic biology. Results: We have assembled a modular library of synthetic morphogenetic driver genes to control (separately) mammalian cell adhesion, locomotion, fusion, proliferation and elective cell death. Here we describe this library and demonstrate its use in the T-REx-293 human cell line to induce each of these desired morphological behaviours on command. Conclusions: Building on from the simple test systems described here, we want to extend engineered control of morphogenetic cell behaviour to more complex 3D structures that can inform embryologists and may, in the future, be used in surgery and regenerative medicine, making synthetic morphology a powerful tool for developmental biology and tissue engineering.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/26</link>                 <dc:creator>Elise Cachat</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Weijia Liu</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Peter Hohenstein</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jamie Davies</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2014, null:26</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-11-19T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-8-26</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-8-26-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>26</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-19T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/25\">         <title>A DNA-based pattern classifier with in vitro learning and associative recall for genomic characterization and biosensing without explicit sequence knowledge</title>         <description>Background: Genetic material extracted from in situ microbial communities has high promise as an indicator of biological system status. However, the challenge is to access genomic information from all organisms at the population or community scale to monitor the biosystem&#8217;s state. Hence, there is a need for a better diagnostic tool that provides a holistic view of a biosystem&#8217;s genomic status. Here, we introduce an in vitro methodology for genomic pattern classification of biological samples that taps large amounts of genetic information from all genes present and uses that information to detect changes in genomic patterns and classify them. Results: We developed a biosensing protocol, termed Biological Memory, that has in vitro computational capabilities to &#8220;learn&#8221; and &#8220;store&#8221; genomic sequence information directly from genomic samples without knowledge of their explicit sequences, and that discovers differences in vitro between previously unknown inputs and learned memory molecules. The Memory protocol was designed and optimized based upon (1) common in vitro recombinant DNA operations using 20-base random probes, including polymerization, nuclease digestion, and magnetic bead separation, to capture a snapshot of the genomic state of a biological sample as a DNA memory and (2) the thermal stability of DNA duplexes between new input and the memory to detect similarities and differences. For efficient read out, a microarray was used as an output method. When the microarray-based Memory protocol was implemented to test its capability and sensitivity using genomic DNA from two model bacterial strains, i.e., Escherichia coli K12 and Bacillus subtilis, results indicate that the Memory protocol can &#8220;learn&#8221; input DNA, &#8220;recall&#8221; similar DNA, differentiate between dissimilar DNA, and detect relatively small concentration differences in samples. Conclusions: This study demonstrated not only the in vitro information processing capabilities of DNA, but also its promise as a genomic pattern classifier that could access information from all organisms in a biological system without explicit genomic information. The Memory protocol has high potential for many applications, including in situ biomonitoring of ecosystems, screening for diseases, biosensing of pathological features in water and food supplies, and non-biological information processing of memory devices, among many.</description>         <link>http://www.jbioleng.org/content/8/1/25</link>                 <dc:creator>Ju Seok Lee</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Junghuei Chen</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Russell Deaton</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jin-Woo Kim</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Journal of Biological Engineering 2014, null:25</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-11-06T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/1754-1611-8-25</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/1754-1611-8-25-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Journal of Biological Engineering</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>1754-1611</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>25</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-06T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <cc:License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#Reproduction\" />         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#Distribution\" />         <cc:permits rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#DerivativeWorks\" />     </cc:License> </rdf:RDF> ",
