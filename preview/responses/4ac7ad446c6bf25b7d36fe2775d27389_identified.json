Background: Arteriovenous dialysis access may be lost due to stenosis and thrombosis. Patency may be restored by thrombectomy or thrombolysis, but this is often not undertaken when the presentation is delayed. The success rate of delayed intervention is largely unknown.&#13; &#13; Methods: In this single centre study, we identified all instances of arteriovenous vascular access failure treated with angioplasty, thrombectomy or thrombolysis between August 2010 and July 2013. Patency rates immediately after intervention, and after 3 months, were assessed using multilevel mixed effects logistic regression.&#13; &#13; Results: Sixty failures occurred in 41 accesses (38 patients). The access age at failure was 495 (316 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 888) days. Intervention was carried out after more than 48 hours in 19 failures (32%). Immediate patency was achieved in 46 failures, of which 32 remained patent after 3 months. Delaying intervention increased the likelihood of achieving immediate patency (OR 0.55, 95%CI 0.31 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 1.0, p=0.05). Having lost arteriovenous accesses previously increased the risk of immediate failure (OR 4.0, 95%CI 1.07 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 14.95, p=0.04). There was no association between failure-to-intervention-time and 3-month patency rates (p=0.23). Effect estimates did not differ between arteriovenous fistulae and synthetic arteriovenous grafts.&#13; &#13; Conclusion: Delayed intervention for failed arteriovenous vascular access may result in superior early patency rates, and yields equivalent 3 month patency rates.

D.; Fotiadou, A.; Lomas, D. J.; Hopper, M. A.; Poole, K. E. S. Objectives&#13; We have developed a new grading system for hip osteoarthritis using clinical&#13; computed tomography (CT). This technique was compared with Kellgren and&#13; Lawrence (K&amp;L) grading and minimum joint space width (JSW) measurement in&#13; digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from the same CT data. In this paper we&#13; evaluate and compare the accuracy and reliability of these measures in the&#13; assessment of radiological disease.&#13; Design&#13; CT imaging of the hips from 30 female volunteers aged 66\\ufffd\\ufffd17 years were used in&#13; two reproducibility studies, one testing the reliability of the new CT grading system,&#13; the other testing K&amp;L grading and minimum JSW measurement in DRRs from CT data&#13; of the same individuals.&#13; Results&#13; Intra- and inter-observer reliability was substantial for CT grading according to&#13; weighted kappa statistics (0.74 and 0.75 respectively), while intra- and interobserver&#13; reliability was at worst moderate (0.57) and substantial (0.63) respectively&#13; for DRR K&amp;L grading. Bland-Altman analysis showed a systematic difference in&#13; minimum JSW measurement of 0.82 mm between reviewers, with a least detectable&#13; difference of 1.06 mm. The area under the curve from ROC analysis was 0.91 for our&#13; CT composite score.&#13; Conclusions&#13; CT grading of hip osteoarthritis (categorised as none, developing and established)&#13; has substantial reliability. Sensitivity was increased when CT features of&#13; osteoarthritis were assigned a composite score (0=none to 7=severest) that also&#13; performed well as a diagnostic test, but at the cost of reliability. Having established&#13; feasibility and reliability for this new CT system, sensitivity testing and validation&#13; against clinical measures of hip osteoarthritis will now be performed.

D.; Lomas, D. J.; Hopper, M. A.; Poole, K. E. S. Objective&#13; Plain radiography has been the mainstay of imaging assessment in osteoarthritis for&#13; over 50 years, but it does have limitations. Here we present the methodology and&#13; results of a new technique for identifying, grading, and mapping the severity and&#13; spatial distribution of osteoarthritic disease features at the hip in 3D with clinical&#13; computed tomography (CT).&#13; Design&#13; CT imaging of 456 hips from 230 adult female volunteers (mean age 66 \\ufffd\\ufffd 17 yrs) was&#13; reviewed using 3D multiplanar reformatting to identify bone-related radiological&#13; features of osteoarthritis, namely osteophytes, subchondral cysts and joint space&#13; narrowing. Scoresheets dividing up the femoral head, head-neck region and the joint&#13; space were used to register the location and severity of each feature (scored from 0&#13; to 3). Novel 3D cumulative feature severity maps were then created to display where&#13; the most severe disease features from each individual were anatomically located&#13; across the cohort.&#13; Results&#13; Feature severity maps showed a propensity for osteophytes at the inferoposterior&#13; and superolateral femoral head-neck junction. Subchondral cysts were a less&#13; common and less localised phenomenon. Joint space narrowing &lt;1.5mm was&#13; recorded in at least one sector of 83% of hips, but most frequently in the&#13; posterolateral joint space.&#13; Conclusions&#13; This is the first description of hip osteoarthritis using unenhanced clinical CT in which&#13; we describe the co-localisation of posterior osteophytes and joint space narrowing&#13; for the first time. We believe this technique can perform several important roles in&#13; future osteoarthritis research, including phenotyping and sensitive disease&#13; assessment in 3D.

Ischaemia and metabolic dysfunction remain important causes of neuronal loss following head injury, and we have shown that normobaric hyperoxia may rescue such metabolic compromise. This study examines the impact of hyperoxia within injured brain using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Fourteen patients underwent DTI at baseline and following one hour of 80% oxygen. Using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) we assessed the impact of hyperoxia within contusions and a 1 cm border zone of normal appearing pericontusion, and within a rim of perilesional reduced ADC consistent with cytotoxic oedema and metabolic compromise. Seven healthy volunteers underwent imaging at 21%, 60% and 100% oxygen. &#13; In volunteers there was no ADC change with hyperoxia, and contusion and pericontusion ADC values were higher than volunteers (p &lt; 0.01). There was no ADC change following hyperoxia within contusion, but an increase within pericontusion (p &lt; 0.05). We identified a rim of perilesional cytotoxic oedema in 13 patients, and hyperoxia resulted in an ADC increase towards normal (p = 0.02). &#13; We demonstrate that hyperoxia may result in benefit within the perilesional rim of cytotoxic &#13; oedema. Future studies should address whether a longer period of hyperoxia has a favourable &#13; impact on the evolution of tissue injury.
