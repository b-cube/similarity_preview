This&lt;br /&gt; tank is capable of producing hurricane strength wind speeds of up to 67 m/s. The&lt;br /&gt; measured transfer velocities spanned two orders of magnitude, lying between 11 cm/h and&lt;br /&gt; 1180 cm/h with the latter being the highest ever measured wind induced gas transfer&lt;br /&gt; velocity. They are more than a factor of 20 larger than the ones observed in the Aeolotron&lt;br /&gt; at the highest wind speed. The measured gas transfer velocities are in agreement with the&lt;br /&gt; only available dataset at hurricane wind speeds (McNeil &amp;amp; D&amp;rsquo;Asaro 2007). The&lt;br /&gt; disproportionately large increase of the transfer velocities found at highest wind speeds&lt;br /&gt; indicates a new regime of air-sea gas transfer, which is characterized by strong wave&lt;br /&gt; breaking, enhanced turbulence and bubble cloud entrainment. However, using only two&lt;br /&gt; tracers in the presented pilot experiment, the respective effects of enhanced turbulence&lt;br /&gt; due to breaking waves, additional surface and turbulence due to bubbles and spray as&lt;br /&gt; well as generally enlarged surface due to waves could not be separately quantified.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>   </front>   <article-type>user-asi</article-type> </article>   </articles>",
