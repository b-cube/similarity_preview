It excludes Alaska and Hawaii.  In addition to the graphical formats, the map key is included in ASCII text. A geographic information system (GIS) allows combining and overlaying of layers for analysis of spatial relations not readily apparent in the standard paper publication.  This disc contains only geology.  However, digital data on geology, geophysics, and geochemistry can be combined to create useful derivative products-- for example, see Phillips and others (1993). This CD-ROM contains a copy of the text and figures from Professional Paper 901 by King and Beikman (1974a).  This text describes the historical background of the map, details of the compilation process, and limitations to interpretation.  The digital version of the text can be searched for keywords or phrases.</abstract><purpose>Conversion of the geologic map of the U.S. to a digital format was undertaken to facilitate the presentation and analysis of earth-science data.  Digital maps can be displayed at any scale or projection, whereas a paper map has a fixed scale and projection.  However, the geology on this disc is not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:2,500,000.</purpose><supplinf>For DOS users, the CD-ROM contains menu-driven analytical software, in which the user selects from an array of topics.  The CD-ROM also contains MAPPER display software, a user-friendly package that displays the interactive vector map.  The raster image of the geologic map can be displayed with VIEWLBL. For other types of computer users, the map must be converted from one of the following formats included on the CD-ROM: ARC/INFO 6.1.1 Export Digital Line Graph (DLG) Optional Drawing Exchange File (DXF) Map Overlay Statistical System (MOSS)</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><mdattim><sngdate><caldate>1974</caldate></sngdate><sngdate><caldate>1994</caldate></sngdate></mdattim></timeinfo><current>Publication date of the original work (1974) and the CD-ROM (1994)</current></timeperd><status><progress>complete</progress><update>not planned</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-162.0</westbc><eastbc>-66.0</eastbc><northbc>60.0</northbc><southbc>24.0</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>Geology</themekey><themekey>Bedrock</themekey></theme><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>Conterminous United States</placekey></place><theme><themekt>National Geologic Map Database Catalog themes, augmented</themekt><themekey>1100 - Geology</themekey><themekey>1101 - General</themekey></theme><place><placekt>Common geographic areas thesaurus</placekt><placekey>US01 = Alabama</placekey><placekey>US04 = Arizona</placekey><placekey>US05 = Arkansas</placekey><placekey>US06 = California</placekey><placekey>US08 = Colorado</placekey><placekey>US09 = Connecticut</placekey><placekey>US10 = Delaware</placekey><placekey>US11 = District of Columbia</placekey><placekey>US12 = Florida</placekey><placekey>US13 = Georgia</placekey><placekey>US16 = Idaho</placekey><placekey>US17 = Illinois</placekey><placekey>US18 = Indiana</placekey><placekey>US19 = Iowa</placekey><placekey>US20 = Kansas</placekey><placekey>US21 = Kentucky</placekey><placekey>US22 = Louisiana</placekey><placekey>US23 = Maine</placekey><placekey>US24 = Maryland</placekey><placekey>US25 = Massachusetts</placekey><placekey>US26 = Michigan</placekey><placekey>US27 = Minnesota</placekey><placekey>US28 = Mississippi</placekey><placekey>US29 = Missouri</placekey><placekey>US30 = Montana</placekey><placekey>US31 = Nebraska</placekey><placekey>US32 = Nevada</placekey><placekey>US33 = New Hampshire</placekey><placekey>US34 = New Jersey</placekey><placekey>US35 = New Mexico</placekey><placekey>US36 = New York</placekey><placekey>US37 = North Carolina</placekey><placekey>US38 = North Dakota</placekey><placekey>US39 = Ohio</placekey><placekey>US40 = Oklahoma</placekey><placekey>US41 = Oregon</placekey><placekey>US42 = Pennsylvania</placekey><placekey>US44 = Rhode Island</placekey><placekey>US45 = South Carolina</placekey><placekey>US46 = South Dakota</placekey><placekey>US47 = Tennessee</placekey><placekey>US48 = Texas</placekey><placekey>US49 = Utah</placekey><placekey>US50 = Vermont</placekey><placekey>US51 = Virginia</placekey><placekey>US53 = Washington</placekey><placekey>US54 = West Virginia</placekey><placekey>US55 = Wisconsin</placekey></place><theme><themekt>Gateway to the Earth (USGS) draft 6</themekt><themekey>geology</themekey><themekey>geologic maps</themekey><themekey>lithostratigraphy</themekey><themekey>faults</themekey><themekey>folds (geologic)</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt><themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>NGDA Portfolio Themes</themekt><themekey>Geology</themekey></theme></keywords><accconst>none</accconst><useconst>none</useconst><ptcontac><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>Schruben, Paul G.</cntper><cntorg>Minerals Information Office</cntorg></cntperp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>Mail Stop 920, National Center U.S. Geological Survey 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive</address><city>Reston</city><state>VA</state><postal>20192</postal></cntaddr><cntvoice>(703) 648-6142</cntvoice><cntfax>(703) 648-6057</cntfax><cntemail>pschruben@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></ptcontac><browse><browsen>http://pubs.usgs.gov/dds/dds11/kb.gif</browsen><browsed>Bedrock geologic map units of the conterminous United States</browsed><browset>GIF</browset></browse><native>Data General AViiON 6220 computer system running the DG/UX version of UNIX.</native><crossref><citeinfo><origin>King, Philip B.</origin><origin>Beikman, Helen M.</origin><pubdate>1974</pubdate><title>Explanatory text to accompany the geologic map of the United States</title><serinfo><sername>U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper</sername><issue>901</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>Reston, VA</pubplace><publish>U.S. Geological Survey</publish></pubinfo></citeinfo></crossref></idinfo><dataqual><attracc><attraccr>The linework was captured by hand digitizing as well as scanning from the paper map and negatives.

The final mosaic was adjusted several times to correct for registration problems.  The coastline was taken from the 1:2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987), generalized to 1 km. Construction of a geologic map of an area as large and complex as the conterminous United States requires a great deal of generalization: geologic units shown on larger scale maps are combined into broader map units and their contacts are simplified to produce a pattern that is legible at the scale of publication.  The process of generalization used in the compilation of the Geologic Map of the United States is described in King and Beikman (1974a, p. 20). Furthermore, the Geologic Map of the United States is primarily a bedrock map, which depicts geologic materials present beneath the soil or relatively thin mantles of surficial deposits, not necessarily the surficial materials themselves.  For example, the map does not depict the glacial deposits in the northern States, the widespread eolian deposits in the High Plains, and the high-level gravels that mantle older Tertiary and pre-Tertiary units in much of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains.</attraccr></attracc><logic>The coverages on this disc for the digital geologic map of the conterminous United States differ in several ways from the published map.  The county outlines, cities, drainage, and other base-map information are not present on the digital version except as overlays in MAPPER.  Only the larger water bodies are included. The larger geology polygons are split into several smaller polygons to avoid problems with color and pattern fill on screen plots and paper plotters. The maximum polygon size is 1476 vertices, which is PostScript compatible. The rock-unit names are stored in uppercase letters as well as the published mixed case.  For instance: &gt; TMC   Tmc &gt; TMOE  Tmoe &gt; UTA   uTa The uppercase names are used in the coverage because an INFO sort in ARC/INFO is case sensitive.  The lookup tables must be sorted to work correctly.  The mixed-case rock-unit names are in the kbcolor.lut lookup table.  Longer rock-unit descriptions such as: &gt; Cretaceous granitic rocks &gt; Washita Group are in the ROCKDESC column of the .pat file of the KBLEG coverage.  Some of the unit names have been modified to avoid ambiguity. The Pennsylvanian symbol is stored as PP in: &gt;     PP &gt;     PP1 &gt;     PP1a &gt;     PP2 &gt;     PP3 &gt;     PP4 The Triassic symbol is stored as Tr in: &gt;     JTr &gt;     Tr &gt;     TrPe &gt;     Trv &gt;     Tri &gt;     Trg The Cambrian symbol is stored as C in: &gt;     C &gt;     Cq &gt;     OC &gt;     Ce &gt;     Cv &gt;     Cg &gt; m1 is replaced with mm1 to avoid confusion with M1 &gt; m2 is replaced with mm2 to avoid confusion with M2 &gt; m3 is replaced with mm3 to avoid confusion with M3 &gt; m4 is replaced with mm4 for consistency The extent of glaciation appears in the legend but is not present in the coverage.</logic><complete>The map does not include coverage of Alaska, Hawaii, or territories. The Geologic Map of the United States is primarily a bedrock map, which depicts geologic materials present beneath the soil or relatively thin mantles of surficial deposits, not necessarily the surficial materials themselves.

The Geologic Map of the United States (King and Beikman, 1974b) is intended to be used at a scale of 1:2,500,000; it is not intended to be used at a more detailed scale.  For instance, Colorado is about 10 inches wide at the published scale of the King and Beikman map.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Philip B.
