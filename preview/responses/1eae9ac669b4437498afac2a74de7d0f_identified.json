It excludes Alaska and Hawaii.  In addition to the graphical formats, the map key is included in ASCII text. A geographic information system (GIS) allows combining and overlaying of layers for analysis of spatial relations not readily apparent in the standard paper publication.  This disc contains only geology.  However, digital data on geology, geophysics, and geochemistry can be combined to create useful derivative products-- for example, see Phillips and others (1993). This CD-ROM contains a copy of the text and figures from Professional Paper 901 by King and Beikman (1974a).  This text describes the historical background of the map, details of the compilation process, and limitations to interpretation.  The digital version of the text can be searched for keywords or phrases.</abstract>             <purpose>Conversion of the geologic map of the U.S. to a digital format was undertaken to facilitate the presentation and analysis of earth-science data.  Digital maps can be displayed at any scale or projection, whereas a paper map has a fixed scale and projection.  However, the geology on this disc is not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:2,500,000.</purpose>             <supplinf>For DOS users, the CD-ROM contains menu-driven analytical software, in which the user selects from an array of topics.  The CD-ROM also contains MAPPER display software, a user-friendly package that displays the interactive vector map.  The raster image of the geologic map can be displayed with VIEWLBL. For other types of computer users, the map must be converted from one of the following formats included on the CD-ROM: ARC/INFO 6.1.1 Export Digital Line Graph (DLG) Optional Drawing Exchange File

The final mosaic was adjusted several times to correct for registration problems.  The coastline was taken from the 1:2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987), generalized to 1 km. Construction of a geologic map of an area as large and complex as the conterminous United States requires a great deal of generalization: geologic units shown on larger scale maps are combined into broader map units and their contacts are simplified to produce a pattern that is legible at the scale of publication.  The process of generalization used in the compilation of the Geologic Map of the United States is described in King and Beikman (1974a, p. 20). Furthermore, the Geologic Map of the United States is primarily a bedrock map, which depicts geologic materials present beneath the soil or relatively thin mantles of surficial deposits, not necessarily the surficial materials themselves.  For example, the map does not depict the glacial deposits in the northern States, the widespread eolian deposits in the High Plains, and the high-level gravels that mantle older Tertiary and pre-Tertiary units in much of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains.</attraccr>         </attracc>         <logic>The coverages on this disc for the digital geologic map of the conterminous United States differ in several ways from the published map.  The county outlines, cities, drainage, and other base-map information are not present on the digital version except as overlays in MAPPER.  Only the larger water bodies are included. The larger geology polygons are split into several smaller polygons to avoid problems with color and pattern fill on screen plots and paper plotters. The maximum polygon size is 1476 vertices, which is PostScript compatible. The rock-unit names are stored in uppercase letters as well as the published mixed case.  For instance: &gt; TMC   Tmc &gt; TMOE  Tmoe &gt; UTA   uTa The uppercase names are used in the coverage because an INFO sort in ARC/INFO is case sensitive.  The lookup tables must be sorted to work correctly.  The mixed-case rock-unit names are in the kbcolor.lut lookup table.  Longer rock-unit descriptions such as: &gt; Cretaceous granitic rocks &gt; Washita Group are in the ROCKDESC column of the .pat file of the KBLEG coverage.  Some of the unit names have been modified to avoid ambiguity. The Pennsylvanian symbol is stored as PP in: &gt;     PP &gt;     PP1 &gt;     PP1a &gt;     PP2 &gt;     PP3 &gt;     PP4 The Triassic symbol is stored as Tr in: &gt;     JTr &gt;     Tr &gt;     TrPe &gt;     Trv &gt;     Tri &gt;     Trg The Cambrian symbol is stored as C in: &gt;     C &gt;     Cq &gt;     OC &gt;     Ce &gt;     Cv &gt;     Cg &gt; m1 is replaced with mm1 to avoid confusion with M1 &gt; m2 is replaced with mm2 to avoid confusion with M2 &gt; m3 is replaced with mm3 to avoid confusion with M3 &gt; m4 is replaced with mm4 for consistency The extent of glaciation appears in the legend but is not present in the coverage.</logic>         <complete>The map does not include coverage of Alaska, Hawaii, or territories.

The final mosaic was adjusted several times to correct for registration problems.  The coastline was taken from the 1:2,000,000 scale Digital Line Graph data (U.S. Geological Survey, 1987), generalized to 1 km. The ARC/INFO version of the Geologic Map of the United States consists of three coverages: 1) geology - 12,800 polygons 2) faults  - 3 fault types and hidden contacts 3) legend  - 164 rock units The fault coverage has four line types: 1) faults 2) dashed faults 3) dotted faults 4) hidden contacts The DESC field descriptors are FAULT, DASH, DOT, CONTAC, respectively.</procdesc>                 <srcused>King and Beikman (1974)</srcused>                 <procdate>1993</procdate>             </procstep>             <procstep>                 <procdesc>Unprojected vector data repackaged using EPSG 4269 coordinate system (geographic, NAD83, decimal degrees) as on http://mrdata.usgs.gov/</procdesc>                 <procdate>20071009</procdate>                 <srcprod>http://mrdata.usgs.gov/geology/us/kbgeology.zip</srcprod>                 <proccont>                     <cntinfo>                         <cntperp>                             <cntper>Peter N Schweitzer</cntper>                             <cntorg>USGS ER GD</cntorg>                         </cntperp>                         <cntpos>Geologist</cntpos>                         <cntaddr>                             <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>                             <address>12201 Sunrise Valley Drive</address>                             <city>Reston</city>                             <state>VA</state>                             <postal>20192-0002</postal>                             <country>USA</country>                         </cntaddr>                         <cntvoice>703-648-6533</cntvoice>                         <cntfax>703-648-6252</cntfax>                         <cntemail>pschweitzer@usgs.gov</cntemail>                     </cntinfo>                 </proccont>             </procstep>         </lineage>     </dataqual>     <spdoinfo>         <direct>Vector</direct>         <ptvctinf>             <sdtsterm>                 <sdtstype>Point</sdtstype>                 <ptvctcnt>21465</ptvctcnt>             </sdtsterm>             <sdtsterm>                 <sdtstype>Complete chain</sdtstype>                 <ptvctcnt>29972</ptvctcnt>             </sdtsterm>             <sdtsterm>                 <sdtstype>GT-polygon composed of chains</sdtstype>                 <ptvctcnt>12860</ptvctcnt>             </sdtsterm>         </ptvctinf>     </spdoinfo>     <spref>         <horizsys>             <geograph>                 <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>             </geograph>             <geodetic>                 <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>                 <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>                 <semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis>                 <denflat>298.257</denflat>             </geodetic>         </horizsys>     </spref>     <eainfo>         <detailed>             <enttyp>                 <enttypl>Geologic unit</enttypl>                 <enttypd>Bedrock formations that are, wherever possible, time-stratigraphic--that is, units which are approximately the same geologic ages at all places, such as systems, series, and stages.</enttypd>                 <enttypds>U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 901</enttypds>             </enttyp>         </detailed>         <detailed>             <enttyp>                 <enttypl>Fault</enttypl>                 <enttypd>Faults are shown not only to explain offsets of map units, but for their own sake, to express the structural grain of the area.
