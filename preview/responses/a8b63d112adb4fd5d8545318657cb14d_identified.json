Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) derived raster data is the underlying data set from which the polygons and vectors were created. PRISM is an analytical model that uses point data and a digital elevation model (DEM) to generate gridded estimates of annual, monthly and event-based climatic parameters.</abstract>         <purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the Spatial Climate Analysis Service, the USDA - NRCS National Water and Climate Center, the USDA - NRCS National Cartography and Geospatial Center, or the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.</purpose>         <supplinf>There are many methods of interpolating precipitation from monitoring stations to grid points. Some provide estimates of acceptable accuracy in flat terrain, but few have been able to adequately explain the extreme, complex variations in precipitation that occur in mountainous regions. Significant progress in this area has been achieved through the development of PRISM (Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model). PRISM is an analytical model that uses point data and a digital elevation model (DEM) to generate gridded estimates of monthly and annual precipitation (as well as other climatic parameters). PRISM is well suited to regions with mountainous terrain, because it incorporates a conceptual framework that addresses the spatial scale and pattern of precipitation in such regions. Detailed descriptions of the PRISM raster data can be found on the Oregon State University PRISM web page at &lt;http://www.ocs.orst.edu/prism&gt;. Additional information is available through the Natural Resources Conservation Service web pages at the National Water and Climate Center at &lt;http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/water/climate/prism/prism.html&gt; or through the National Cartography and Geospatial Center at &lt;http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/prism/prismdata.html&gt;. Other source PRISM data sets are also available in Arc/INFO coverage and Arc/INFO ASCII GRID formats from the Spatial Climate Analysis Service. See &lt;http://www.ocs.orst.edu/prism/prism_products.html&gt; for more information. The source PRISM data is packaged on 3 CD-ROM's covering the Lower 48 United States and is available from NRCS for $50 per CD-ROM. The 48 States are broken into three regions: East, Central and West. Each CD contains the annual and monthly precipitation coverages, as well as the gridded data. The CD-ROM's may be ordered through &lt;http://www.ftw.nrcs.usda.gov/prism/prismdata.html&gt;.</supplinf>      </descript>       <timeperd>        <timeinfo>          <rngdates>            <begdate>19610101</begdate>             <enddate>19901231</enddate>          </rngdates>        </timeinfo>         <current>ground condition</current>      </timeperd>       <status>        <progress>Complete</progress>         <update>No updates are planned for the 1961-1990 climatological period.

PRISM precipitation estimates were reviewed by the PRISM Evaluation Group, a panel of climatologists, meteorologists, and hydrologists. The task of this group was to assess the assumptions made by the model and compare model output with the best available precipitation maps from several western States. The group found that the PRISM maps equaled or exceeded the accuracy of the best maps available.</attraccr>      </attracc>       <logic>Precipitation data were derived from two main sources, NCDC Climate Normals and NRCS Cooperative Snow Survey Data (SNOTEL). In general, NCDC stations are located at low elevations and in valley bottoms, and encompass the entire United States. SNOTEL stations are located primarily at high elevations in the western United States. Polygon and chain-node topology are present. Checks were made to ensure that no two adjacent polygons are labeled with the same precipitation value. A manual spot check was made of peaks, depressions, and islands.</logic>       <complete>This data set includes observations and interpolated values for the 48 contiguous United States and the District of Columbia, for the climatological period 1961-1990.
