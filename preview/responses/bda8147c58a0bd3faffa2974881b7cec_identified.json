This body, called the <soCalled>Council of the Areopagus,</soCalled> or simply the <soCalled>Areopagus,</soCalled> existed long before the democracy, and its powers and composition changed many times over the centuries. Originally, it was the central governing body of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, but under the democracy, it was a primarily the court with jurisdiction over cases of homicide and certain other serious crimes. After an Athenian had served as one of the nine <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archons</xref>, his conduct in office was investigated, and if he passed that investigation he became a member of the Areopagus. Tenure was for life.</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Introduction\" n=\"Introduction\"> <head>Introduction</head>  <p>The <name type=\"site\" n=\"areopagus\">Areopagus</name> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">*)arei=os pa/gos</foreign>) was a hill in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, south of the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Agora, Athens\">Agora</name>, to the north-west of the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Acropolis, Athens\">Acropolis</name> (<bibl author=\"Herodotus\" work=\"Hdt.\" n=\"Hdt. 8.52\">Hdt. 8.52</bibl>). The term <soCalled><name type=\"site\" n=\"areopagus\">Areopagus</name>,</soCalled> however, often refers to the <quote>Council of the Areopagus</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">h( boulh\\\\ h( e)c *)arei/ou pa/gou</foreign>), a governmental institution that met on that hill (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.92\">Aeschin. 1.92</bibl>). This institution was very ancient, existing long before democratic government. Its history, which recedes back into mythological pre-history, follows closely the political history of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, and shows the ongoing tension between democratic and anti-democratic forces (see, for example, <bibl author=\"Isocrates\" work=\"Isoc. 15\" n=\"Isoc. 15.316\">Isoc. 15.316</bibl>, in which he complains that as the city grew more democratic, the power of the older institutions, such as the Areopagus, declined). In this article, we will first present the evidence for the composition, procedures, and jurisdiction of the Council of the Areopagus in the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century BCE</dateRange>, when it was one of the institutions of the fully developed Athenian democracy. Then we will give the evidence that describes its history. Finally, we will give some evidence for special functions that the Areopagus seemed to perform in the later <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange>.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"FourthCentury\" n=\"FourthCentury\"> <head>The <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th c.</dateRange></head>  <p>The Council of the Areopagus functioned as a court under the democracy of <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange> <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, and it had a very high reputation (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.65\">Dem. 23.65</bibl>). The orator <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Lycurgus</name> tells his fellow Athenians that, <quote>you have, in the Council of the Areopagus, the finest model in <placeName key=\"Greece\">Greece</placeName>: a court so superior to others that even the men convicted in it admit that its judgements are just</quote> (<bibl author=\"Lycurgus\" work=\"Lyc. 1\" n=\"Lyc. 1.12\">Lyc. 1.12</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> speaks of the Areopagus in similar terms but praises the institution at greater length: <quote>Take the example of the Council of the Areopagus, the most scrupulous tribunal in the city. I myself have before now seen many men convicted before this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently and presented witnesses; and I know that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and although no witnesses testified for them. For it is not on the strength of the pleading alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations. And this is the reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.92\">Aeschin. 1.92</bibl>). </p> <p>Members of the Areopagus individually and the institution generally were held in high regard and considered to be worthy of respect. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> reports an incident when <name type=\"person\">Autolycus</name>, a member of the Areopagus, unwittingly made a sexual pun; when the people laughed, <name type=\"person\">Pyrrandrus</name> scolded them, asking if they <quote>were not ashamed of themselves for laughing in the presence of the Council of the Areopagus</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.84\">Aeschin. 1.84</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> is careful to defend <name type=\"person\">Autolycus</name>, as <quote>a man whose life has been good and pious, and so worthy of that body <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">i.e. the Areopagus</note></quote> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.82\">Aeschin. 1.82</bibl>). </p> <p>The principle function of the Areopagus, in the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century BCE</dateRange>, was to try cases of homicide. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> describes this function and the lengths to which the court went to ensure that its proceedings were fair and just; this passage, addressed to the Athenians, also suggests that the Athenians saw a strong relationship between human and divine justice: <quote>You are all of course aware that in the Areopagus, where the law both permits and enjoins the trial of homicide, first, every man who brings accusation of such a crime must make oath by invoking destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household; secondly, that he must not treat this oath as an ordinary oath, but as one which no man swears for any other purpose; for he stands over the entrails of a boar, a ram, and a bull, and they must have been slaughtered by the necessary officers and on the days appointed, so that in respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of solemnity has been satisfied. Even then the person who has sworn this tremendous oath does not gain immediate credence; and if any falsehood is brought home to him, he will carry away with him to his children and his kindred the stain of perjury&#8212;but gain nothing. If, on the other hand, he is believed to be laying a just charge, and if he proves the accused guilty of murder, even then he has no power over the convicted criminal; only the laws and the appointed officers have power over the man for punishment.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.67\">Dem. 23.67</bibl>-69).  </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Composition\" n=\"Composition\"> <head>Composition in the 4th c.</head>  <p>The Areopagus consisted of former <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archons</xref> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut. Sol.\" n=\"Plut. Sol. 19.1\">Plut. <title>Sol.</title> 19.1</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.22\">Dem. 24.22</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 60.3\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 60.3</bibl>). This meant that all members of the Areopagus had been thoroughly investigated by officials of the democracy. All <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archons</xref> were subject to <quote>scrutiny</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">dokimasi/a</foreign>) by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">Thesmothetae</xref> (the lower six of the nine <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">archons</xref>)&#8212;an investigation into their qualifications to serve&#8212;before they assumed their office (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 26\" n=\"Lys. 26.9\">Lys. 26.9</bibl>). So, in a passage from <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name>, the Areopagus is said to <quote>consist of those who have undergone scrutiny</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e)k tw=n dedokimasme/nwn kaqi/statai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Mem.\" n=\"Xen. Mem. 3.5.20\">Xen. <title>Mem.</title> 3.5.20</bibl>). At the end of their year of service, each <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archon</xref> was investigated by the <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>;</soCalled> only those <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">archons</xref> who passed this public audit (<foreign lang=\"grc\">eu)/quna</foreign>) could become members of the Areopagus (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 26\" n=\"Dem. 26.5\">Dem. 26.5</bibl>). An <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archon</xref> could fail this audit (<foreign lang=\"grc\">eu)/quna</foreign>) by violating any of the laws governing the conduct of his office (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.22\">Dem. 24.22</bibl>). For example, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Eponymous Archon</xref> was responsible for collecting and holding the olive oil that was given as a prize at the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Festivals\">Panathenaic Games</xref>; this <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archon</xref> was not allowed to become a member of the Areopagus until he had handed all of the oil over to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">treasurers</xref> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">oi( tami/ai</foreign>) on the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Acropolis, Athens\">Acropolis</name> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 60.3\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 60.3</bibl>). </p> <p>Appointment to the Areopagus was for life (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 3.6\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 3.6</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 26\" n=\"Lys. 26.11\">Lys. 26.11</bibl>). Nevertheless, members of the Areopagus, the Areopagites, were still subject to audit (<foreign lang=\"grc\">eu)/quna</foreign>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> describes this to his fellow Athenians as a democratic measure: <quote>For, first, the Council of the Areopagus is required by the law to file its accounts with the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Board of Auditors</xref> and to submit to their examination; yes, even those men, who sit with solemn aspect yonder as the court of highest competence, are brought under your verdict</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.20\">Aeschin. 3.20</bibl>). </p> <p>When <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> says that service on the Areopagus was for life, he describes that service as an <quote>office</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">a)rxh/</foreign>): <quote>It alone of the offices was held for life, as it is even now</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">dio\\\\ kai\\\\ mo/nh tw=n a)rxw=n au(/th meme/nhke dia\\\\ bi/ou kai\\\\ nu=n</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 3.6\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 3.6</bibl>). But it was clearly not like the other offices in that someone could be an Areopagite and hold other offices at the same time. When Athenians were sworn in as <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jurors</xref> in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>, they swore <quote>not to suffer the same man to hold the same office twice, or two offices in the same year</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.150\">Dem. 24.150</bibl>). But we know from an <name type=\"ancientGenre\">inscription</name> that a man named <name type=\"person\">Euboulos</name> was one of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">Thesmothetae</xref> in <dateRange from=\"-370\" to=\"-369\">370/69</dateRange>, and an Areopagite from <date value=\"-369\">369</date> on (<bibl n=\"SEG 19 133\"><title>SEG</title> 19 133</bibl>; source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\">Hansen, p. 289</bibl>). But we also know that <name type=\"person\">Euboulos</name> was on the board of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"theoric fund\">Theoric Fund</xref> in the <dateRange from=\"-359\" to=\"-350\">350s</dateRange> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.25\">Aeschin. 3.25</bibl>; source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\">Hansen, p. 289</bibl>). </p> <p>Members of the Areopagus seem to have received a free portion of the meat from certain sacrifices, an added benefit of service (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.56\">Din. 1.56</bibl>)  </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"MeetingPlaces\" n=\"MeetingPlaces\"> <head>Meeting Places in the 4th c.</head>  <p>The Council of the Areopagus met generally on the <name type=\"site\" n=\"areopagus\">Areopagus</name>, the Hill of <name type=\"god\">Ares</name> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.65-66\">Dem. 23.65-66</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Isocrates\" work=\"Isoc. 7\" n=\"Isoc. 7.38\">Isoc. 7.38</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> mentions the body also meeting in the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Stoa Basileus, Athens\">Stoa Basileus</name> in the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Agora, Athens\">Agora</name>, which was roped off for the occasion, so the court would not be disturbed (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 25\" n=\"Dem. 25.23\">Dem. 25.23</bibl>). </p> <p>But the <name type=\"site\" n=\"areopagus\">Hill of Ares</name> was its proper meeting place, and that location was rich in symbolic importance. A <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange> inscription records a law that seems aimed at preventing the overthrow of the Athenian democracy. It says that, <quote>If the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> or the democracy at Athens are overthrown, no member of the Council of the Areopagus shall go up to the <name type=\"site\" n=\"areopagus\">Areopagus</name> or meet in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> or discuss any single thing</quote> (<bibl n=\"SEG 12 87\"><title>SEG</title> 12 87</bibl>). This suggests two things. First, the site of the <name type=\"site\" n=\"areopagus\">Hill of Ares</name> lent legitimacy to whatever went on there&#8212;and so the authors of this law wanted to deny that meeting place to any government that followed the overthrow of the democracy. Second, the law suggests that the members of the Council of the Areopagus were assumed to be people of great authority&#8212;and so the authors of this law wanted to prevent them from exercising that authority after the overthrow of the democracy. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> says that, at least when the Areopagus was acting in its role as a murder court, it met <quote>in the sacred precinct, in the open air</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e)n i(erw|= kai\\\\ u(pai/qrioi</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 57.4\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 57.4</bibl>).  </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Procedure\" n=\"Procedure\"> <head>Procedure in the 4th c.</head>  <p>The Areopagus, functioning as a court of law during the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange>, had a reputation for following unimpeachable procedures. In his speech against <name type=\"person\">Aristocrates</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> describes this procedure at some length, and begins his description with the claim that <quote>no convicted defendant and no defeated prosecutor has ever made good any complaint against the justice of the verdict given.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.66\">Dem. 23.66</bibl>). Anyone who brought an accusation of homicide before the court had to swear an oath <quote>invoking destruction upon himself, his kindred, and his household</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">prw=ton me\\  diomei=tai kat&#8217; e)cwlei/as au(tou= kai\\\\ ge/nous kai\\\\ oi)ki/as o(/ tin' ai)tiw/menos ei)rga/sqai ti toiou=ton</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.67\">Dem. 23.67</bibl>). The swearing of this oath was unique: a boar, a ram, and a bull were to be sacrificed by certain people and on certain days (<name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> does not say which people or which days), <quote>so that in respect both of the time and of the functionaries every requirement of solemnity has been satisfied</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">w(/ste kai\\\\ e)k tou= xro/nou kai\\\\ e)k tw=n metaxeirizome/nwn a(/pan, o(/son e)/sq&#8217; o(/sion, pepra=xqai</foreign>); the accuser then stood over the entrails of the sacrificed animals and swore his oath. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> is careful to add that, even with this <quote>tremendous oath</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">to\\  toiou=ton o(/rkon</foreign>), the accuser was not automatically believed, and that if he should be proved to have lied, not only would he bear <quote>the stain of perjury</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">th\\  e)piorki/an</foreign>) himself, but his children and relatives would as well (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.68\">Dem. 23.68</bibl>). </p> <p>In this speech and elsewhere, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> emphasizes the extent to which the rights of the accused were protected by law and procedure. If the accuser won his case, and the accused was convicted, the accuser had no power of punishment: <quote>only the laws and the appointed officer have power over the man for punishment. The prosecutor is permitted to see him suffering the penalty awarded by law, and that is all.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.69\">Dem. 23.69</bibl>). If the Areopagus found a defendant guilty in a case of homicide, the court seems to have had the authority to hand him straight over to the executioner (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.62\">Din. 1.62</bibl>; although this passage refers to powers given to the Areopagus by a particular decree in the <dateRange from=\"-350\" to=\"-300\">late 4th century</dateRange>). In other matters, though the Areopagus&#8217; power of punishment was not unlimited. Speaking of a case of impiety, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Apollodorus</name> says that the court <quote>does not have the power to punish any of the Athenians as they see fit.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Apollodorus\" work=\"Dem. 59\" n=\"Dem. 59.80\">Dem. 59.80</bibl>). </p> <p>Defendants swore the same oath as accusers, but <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> says that they had an important additional right: <quote>it is permitted to them to depart after giving his first speech, and neither the prosecutor, nor the jurors, nor any other man is authorized to prevent it</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">to\\  pro/teron d&#8217; e)/cestin ei)po/nta lo/gon metasth=nai, kai\\\\ ou)/q' o( diw/kwn ou)/q' oi( dika/zontes ou)/t' a)/llos a)nqrw/pwn ou)dei\\\\s ku/rios kwlu=sai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.69\">Dem. 23.69</bibl>). We may suppose (although <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> does not make this clear) that the defendant would have to leave <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> after withdrawing from the trial. </p> <p>The trial would proceed with each side giving one or more speeches (see <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.1\">Din. 1.1</bibl>, where he says that he does not have to give all the details of the case because a fellow-prosecutor, <name type=\"person\">Stratocles</name>, has already given his speech). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>, speaking in praise of the Areopagus, says that this court was different from the other courts of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> in that Areopagites were less likely than other jurors to be swayed by skillful speaking alone: <quote>I myself have before now seen many men convicted before this tribunal, though they spoke most eloquently, and presented witnesses; and I know that before now certain men have won their case, although they spoke most feebly, and although no witnesses testified for them. For it is not on the strength of the pleading alone, nor of the testimony alone, that the members of the court give their verdict, but on the strength of their own knowledge and their own investigations. And this is the reason why that tribunal maintains its high repute in the city.</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">pollou\\\\s ga\\\\r h)/dh e)/gwge teqew/rhka e)n tw=| bouleuthri/w| tou/tw| eu)= pa/nu ei)po/ntas kai\\\\ ma/rturas porisame/nous a(lo/ntas: h)/dh de/ tinas kakw=s pa/nu dialexqe/ntas kai\\\\ pra=gma a)ma/rturon e)/xontas oi)=da nikh/santas. ou) ga\\\\r e)k tou= lo/gou mo/non ou)d&#8217; e)k tw=n marturiw=n, a)ll' e)c w(=n au)toi\\\\ suni/sasi kai\\\\ e)chta/kasi, th\\  yh=fon fe/rousi. toiga/rtoi diatelei= tou=to to\\\\ sune/drion eu)dokimou=n e)n th=| po/lei.</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.92\">Aeschin. 1.92</bibl>). </p> <p>The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Archon Basileus</xref> served as the <quote>introducing official</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ei)sa/gousa a)rxh</foreign>), but it seems that he did not actually participate in deciding the case; only the actual members of the Areopagus voted (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

The Areopagus did not merely punish the assailants themselves, but also had the power to punish accessories. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> mentions a case of assault where the Areopagus exiled a man for encouraging the assailant; the defendant in this case was the father of the priestess of <name type=\"god\">Artemis</name> at <placeName key=\"Brauron\">Brauron</placeName>, and therefore an important Athenian, but punished as an accessory nevertheless (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 54\" n=\"Dem. 54.25\">Dem. 54.25</bibl>). </p> <p>According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, not only did the Areopagus permit (<foreign lang=\"grc\">di/dwse</foreign>) Athenians to bring cases of homicide before it for judgement, but actually required it (<foreign lang=\"grc\">keleu/ei</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.67\">Dem. 23.67</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> himself was fined by the Areopagus, according to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>, for failing to pursue a charge of assault (<foreign lang=\"grc\">trau=ma</foreign>) against his cousin <name type=\"person\">Demomeles</name> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 2\" n=\"Aeschin. 2.93\">Aeschin. 2.93</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> goes on to claim that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> had actually wounded himself and falsely accused his cousin (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.15\">Aeschin. 3.15</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 2\" n=\"Aeschin. 2.93\">Aeschin. 2.93</bibl>), but regardless of that complication, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>&#8217; comment suggests that once there was an accusation of a crime over which the Areopagus had jurisdiction, the accuser was obliged to bring the matter to court. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> also describes how a certain <name type=\"person\">Theocrines</name>, whose brother was murdered, threatened to bring the case before the Areopagus, but dropped the matter when the murderer paid him money (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 58\" n=\"Dem. 58.29\">Dem. 58.29</bibl>)&#8212;the fact that <name type=\"person\">Theocrines</name> did this proves, according to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, that he is a <quote>wretch and false accuser</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ponero\\\\s kai\\\\ sukofa/nths</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 58\" n=\"Dem. 58.27\">Dem. 58.27</bibl>). </p> <p>The members of the Areopagus, the Areopagites, also seem to have investigated murders and assaults personally. In a speech prosecuting <name type=\"person\">Conon</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> says that it was possible for members of the Areopagus to come to the bedside of a victim of assault, because if the victim should eventually die, they would have to try the case of his murder (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 54\" n=\"Dem. 54.28\">Dem. 54.28</bibl>). </p> <p>It was a very serious matter to be charged with a crime before the Areopagus. In a speech written by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> for a client the speaker describes how his enemies plotted against him: <quote> When they have thus openly laid a plot, and got up a charge against me before the Areopagus, do you suppose there is any poisoning or any other such villainy from which they would abstain?</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 40\" n=\"Dem. 40.57\">Dem. 40.57</bibl>). This passage compares being charged before the Areopagus with being poisoned, and gives us an idea of how serious such a charge was. Elsewhere in that same speech, the speaker explains that his enemies hoped that by charging him before the Areopagus, he would go into exile rather than risk conviction (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 40\" n=\"Dem. 40.32\">Dem. 40.32</bibl>). </p> <p>According to the rules of procedure, a defendant charged before the Areopagus had the option of leaving the city rather than see the trial to its conclusion (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 23.69\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 23.69</bibl>). If the defendant left, then his property was sold off by the <quote>Venders</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">oi( pwlhtai/</foreign>), after the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Nine Archons</xref> gave their approval for the sale (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Apollodorus</name>, the Areopagus was initially inclined to impose <quote>the highest fine in its power</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e)zhmi/ou o(/sa kuri/a e)stin</foreign>) on <name type=\"person\">Theogenes</name> for allowing his wife to serve as priestess under false pretenses (<bibl author=\"Apollodorus\" work=\"Dem. 59\" n=\"Dem. 59.81\">Dem. 59.81</bibl>), but they relented because <name type=\"person\">Theogenes</name> convinced them that he had been deceived, and meant no harm (<name type=\"person\">Theogenes</name> immediately expelled his wife from his house) (<bibl author=\"Apollodorus\" work=\"Dem. 59\" n=\"Dem. 59.83\">Dem. 59.83</bibl>). </p> <p>An <name type=\"ancientGenre\">inscription</name> from <date value=\"-352\">352</date> or <date value=\"-351\">351 BCE</date> records that the Assembly gave the Areopagus certain authority over the religious sanctuaries of <placeName key=\"Attica\">Attica</placeName> (<bibl n=\"IG II2 204.16-33\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 204.16-33</bibl>; source for date, <bibl primary=\"NO\">Hansen, p.291</bibl>). </p> <p>The Areopagus had authority over the sacred olive trees of <placeName key=\"Attica\">Attica</placeName> as well.

Each tribe (<foreign lang=\"grc\">fulh/</foreign>) would nominate (<foreign lang=\"grc\">prokri/neie</foreign>) ten candidates, and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">nine archons</xref> would then be chosen by random lot from these (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

This procedure would have made the Areopagus somewhat more democratic. </p> <p>The evidence we have, however, is not consistent.

This seems to say that <name type=\"person\">Solon</name> did not change the way <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archons</xref> were selected. The question remains open, but since <bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 8.2\">Aristot. <title>Ath.

Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22.5\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 22.5</bibl>). This passage suggests that the tyrant <name type=\"person\">Pisistratus</name> (<date value=\"-546\">c. 546-</date><date value=\"-528\">528 BCE</date>, source: <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OHCW</title></bibl>) changed the method for selecting archons from random selection to some method over which he could exert control. </p> <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name> reports another ancient historian, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Idomeneus</name> (whose works do not survive) as saying that <name type=\"person\">Aristides</name> was chosen to be <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archon</xref> by election, not by random lot, in <dateRange from=\"-489\" to=\"-488\">489/8 BCE</dateRange> (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut.

When the historian <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Herodotus</name> narrates the battle of <placeName key=\"Marathon\">Marathon</placeName>, which happened in <date value=\"-490\">490 BCE</date> (three years before the archonship of Telesinus in <dateRange from=\"-487\" to=\"-486\">487/6</dateRange>; source: <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OHCW</title></bibl>), he says that <name type=\"person\">Callimachus</name> of <name type=\"deme\" n=\"Aphidnae\">Aphidnae</name> was <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">polemarch</xref> (i.e. one of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">nine archons</xref>), <quote>chosen by lot <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">literally, <soCalled>by bean</soCalled></note> to be <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">polemarch</xref> of the Athenians</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">o( tw|= kua/mw| laxw\\  *)Aqhnai/wn polemarce/ein</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Herodotus\" work=\"Hdt.\" n=\"Hdt. 6.109.2\">Hdt. 6.109.2</bibl>). This, then, might be an example of an <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archon</xref> being chosen by lot, rather than by election, three years earlier than <bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 22.5\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 22.5</bibl> would have us believe. The historian <name type=\"person\">N.G.L. Hammond</name> has made an argument that would bring these two seemingly conflicting pieces of evidence together. He has suggested that before between the tyranny and <dateRange from=\"-487\" to=\"-486\">487/6</dateRange>, nine Athenians were elected to be <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">archons</xref>, but were assigned to individual functions by lot (<bibl primary=\"NO\" n=\"N.G.L.

So, we would then read <bibl author=\"Herodotus\" work=\"Hdt.\" n=\"Hdt. 6.109.2\">Hdt. 6.109.2</bibl> as meaning that <name type=\"person\">Callimachus</name> of <name type=\"deme\" n=\"Aphidnae\">Aphidnae</name> had been elected to be one of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">nine archons</xref>, but had been assigned to be <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">polemarch</xref> by lot. </p> <p>Despite these problems of contradictory evidence, it seems clear that by the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-450\">early years of the 5th century</dateRange>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">nine archons</xref> were chosen by lot, rather than by election.  </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Reforms\" n=\"Reforms\"> <head>History: Reforms of the early 5th c.</head>  <p>For the first good evidence for the Areopagus as a political institution in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, we must wait until the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-400\">5th century  BCE</dateRange>, when the Council of the Areopagus became one focus of attention as pro- and anti-democratic factions worked to shape the government of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>.

So the reform was not, finally, the work of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> alone, but an act of legislation by two of the more democratic institutions in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> connects this event to a newfound feeling of power among the common <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref> of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> following the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Persian Wars\">Persian Wars</xref>, when the less wealthy citizens by serving in the navy had saved the city.

A fragment from <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Philochorus</name>, who was a historian writing in the <dateRange from=\"-299\" to=\"-200\">3rd century BCE</dateRange>, offers a little more detail. In his description of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Legislation\">nomophylakes</xref>, or <quote>guardians of the laws</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">nomofu/lakes</foreign>), he says: <quote>There were seven of them, and they were established when <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> left to the Council of the Areopagus only those cases pertaining to the body</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e(pta\\\\ de\\\\ h)=san kai\\\\ kate/sthsan, w(s *filo/xoros, o(/te *)efia/lths mo/na kate/lipe th=| e)c *)arei/ou pa/gou boulh=| ta\\\\ u(pe\\\\r tou= sw/matos</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Philochorus\" work=\"Philoch. fr. 63\" n=\"Philoch. fr. 64\">Philoch. fr. 64</bibl>). </p> <p>To understand what <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> means by <quote>deprived of superintendence of affairs</quote>, or what <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Philochorus</name> means by <quote>only those cases pertaining to the body</quote> we can only look at comments in the sources about the Court of the Areopagus&#8217; role after <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>&#8217; reforms. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name>, describing the Court of the Areopagus and its functions in <dateRange from=\"-375\" to=\"-325\">the middle of the 4th century BCE</dateRange> (over a century after <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>&#8217; reforms), says that this court had authority over trials of murder, wounding, death by poison, and arson, but that other similar crimes&#8212;involuntary manslaughter, murder of slaves or foreigners, accidental killings, or killings in self-defense&#8212;come before other <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">courts</xref>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">Court of the Palladium</xref> or the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">Court of the Delphinium</xref> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

A law quoted in a speech by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> agrees (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.22\">Dem. 23.22</bibl>); but it is important to remember that laws quoted in speeches may have been added to the manuscript later, sometime centuries later. </p> <p>If <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name>&#8217; reforms took many crimes out of the jurisdiction of the Court of the Areopagus and assigned them to other <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">courts</xref>, with <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">juries</xref> of citizens, then there would have been a greater need for citizens to serve on <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">juries</xref>. And, in fact, several of the accounts of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> and <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name> reforming the Court of the Areopagus also mention the institution of pay for <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> service, an innovation that may have aimed at meeting this new need. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> relates the two reforms very closely, and relates them both to an increasingly democratic government: <quote><name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> and <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name> docked the power of the Council on the Areopagus, while <name type=\"person\">Pericles</name> instituted payment for serving in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">law-courts</xref>, and in this manner finally the successive leaders of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref> led them on by growing stages to the present democracy</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

In <date value=\"-404\">404 BCE</date>, when <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> had been defeated by <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName> after twenty seven years of war, the democracy at <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> was temporarily overthrown and a new, oligarchic government took its place (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 2.3.1\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 2.3.1</bibl>). This government was to last only a year (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 2.4.39\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 2.4.39</bibl>), but marks an important break in the development of the Athenian democracy. According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name>, the government was to consist of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref>, <quote>who would collect the ancestral laws and govern according to them</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">oi(\\\\ tou\\\\s patri/ous no/mous suggra/yousi, kaq&#8217; ou(\\\\s politeu/sousi</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 2.3.1\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 2.3.1</bibl>). This had an immediate effect on the institution of the Areopagus: <quote>At first they were moderate towards the citizens and pretended to be administering the ancestral form of constitution, and they removed from the Areopagus the laws of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> and <name type=\"person\">Archestratus</name> about the Areopagites</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 35.2\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 35.2</bibl>; we should note that this <name type=\"person\">Archestratus</name> is not mentioned by any other source). With the reforms of the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-475\">early 5th century</dateRange> annulled, the Areopagus would presumably return to being the powerful and aristocratic body it has once been. </p> <p>The tyranny of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty</xref> was overthrown in the next year (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 2.4.39\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 2.4.39</bibl>), and the democracy was restored. It is interesting to note, however, that the prestige of the Areopagus was undiminished, despite the body&#8217;s having been one focus of the tyrants&#8217; government. The orator <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Andocides</name> describes how the tyranny was overthrown and how the Athenians drew up a temporary constitution to govern the city during the time of confusion (<bibl n=\"Andoc. 1\">Andoc. 1</bibl>). Included in this speech is a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">decree</xref>, supposedly passed by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> in <date value=\"-403\">403</date>. In this decree, it is obvious how intently the Athenians were returning to democratic principles, and it is also obvious that they still regarded the Areopagus as a vital part of their government; the decree lists various laws and provisions, and concludes: <quote>The laws thus handed over, however, shall be submitted beforehand to the scrutiny of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and the five hundred <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Legislation\">Nomothetae</xref> elected by the Demes, when they have taken their oath. Further, any private citizen who so desires may come before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and suggest improvements in the laws. When the laws have been ratified, they shall be placed under the guardianship of the Council of the Areopagus, to the end that only such laws as have been ratified may be applied by <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">magistrates</xref></quote> (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.84\">Andoc. 1.84</bibl>; source for date, <bibl primary=\"NO\" n=\"OCD3\"><title>OCD</title><edition>3</edition></bibl>). According to this decree, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">People</xref> (in the form of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Legislation\">Nomothetae</xref>, and the Demes) enacted laws, and any private citizen individually could suggest emendations, but the Areopagus was to guard the laws. Notice also, that the decree is careful to note that the <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">magistrates</xref></soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ai) a)rcai/</foreign>) can enact only those laws that have been approved by this democratic process.  </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"AfterThirtyTyrants\" n=\"AfterThirtyTyrants\"> <head>History: After the Thirty Tyrants</head>  <p>The first part of this article on the Areopagus describes its composition, procedures, and powers in the period following the overthrow of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref>. It is for this period, the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-433\">first two-thirds of the 4th century BCE</dateRange>, for which we have the best evidence, both the body of <name type=\"ancientGenre\">Oratory</name>, and the Aristotelian <title>Constitution of the Athenians</title> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title></bibl>). The sections that follow describe some special functions that seem to have fallen under the control of the Areopagus during the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-400\">4th century</dateRange>, functions apart from its role as a court for homicide and impiety.  </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"TimesOfTrouble\" n=\"TimesOfTrouble\"> <head>A Rock in Times of Trouble</head>  <p>We have already seen that the Areopagus played an important role in evacuating <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> during the Persian Invasion at <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-475\">the beginning of the 5th century BCE</dateRange>, both by using its authority to organize the evacuation, and by using its members&#8217; wealth to help pay for the evacuation (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 23.1\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 23.1</bibl>). In the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-400\">4th century</dateRange>, we see the Areopagus acting decisively in another time of national crisis. In <date value=\"-338\">338 BCE</date>, the Athenians and the Thebans, with some other allied states, tried to oppose <name type=\"person\">Philip of Macedon</name>&#8217;s growing power; the climactic battle was fought at <placeName key=\"Chaeronea\">Chaeronea</placeName> in <placeName key=\"Boeotia\">Boeotia</placeName>, and was a terrible defeat for <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> (the battle is narrated by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Diodorus Siculus</name>, beginning at <bibl author=\"Diodorus\" work=\"Diod.\"  n=\"Diod. 16.84\">Diod. 16.84</bibl>; source for date, <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OHCW</title></bibl>). The orators <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> and <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Lycurgus</name> describe how, in the aftermath of that battle, the Areopagus prosecuted people for fleeing <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> during this crisis. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> says, <quote>There came&#8212;it pains me to call it to mind repeatedly&#8212;there came a certain disaster to the city. At that time a certain private citizen who merely undertook to sail to <placeName key=\"Samos\">Samos</placeName> was on the same day punished with death by the Council of the Areopagus, as a traitor to his country. Another private citizen, who sailed away to <placeName key=\"Rhodes\">Rhodes</placeName>, was only the other day prosecuted, because he was a coward in the face of danger.</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.252\">Aeschin. 3.252</bibl>). When <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Lycurgus</name> mentions these events in his prosecution of <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>, he pauses to assure his audience that he means no criticism of the Areopagus; in this passage, the orator is arguing that since some other Athenians were punished for fleeing the city, <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name> ought to be punished as well: <quote>You should bear in mind, gentlemen, that it is not even in your power, unless you go beyond your rights, to acquit this man <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>, since his offence has had judgement passed upon it and a vote of condemnation too. For the council of the Areopagus&#8212;No one need interrupt me. That council was, in my opinion, the greatest bulwark of the city at the time&#8212;seized and executed men who then had fled from their country and abandoned it to the enemy. You must not think, gentlemen, that these councillors who are so scrupulous in trying other men for homicide would themselves have taken the life of any citizen unlawfully. Moreover you condemned <name type=\"person\">Autolycus</name> and punished him because, though he himself had faced the dangers, he was charged with secretly sending his wife and sons away. Yet if you punished him when his only crime was that he had sent away persons useless for war, what should your verdict be on one who, though a man, did not pay his country the price of his nurture? The people also, who looked with horror upon what was taking place, decreed that those who were evading the danger which their country&#8217;s defence involved were liable for treason, meriting in their belief the extreme penalty</quote> (<bibl author=\"Lycurgus\" work=\"Lyc. 1\" n=\"Lyc. 1.52-53\">Lyc. 1.52-53</bibl>; for the trial of <name type=\"person\">Autolycus</name>, see <bibl author=\"Lycurgus\" work=\"Lyc. 1\" n=\"Lyc.

The orator describes how <name type=\"person\">Antiphon</name>, who had been in exile from <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, was caught in the city, but <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> defended him before the people (presumably in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>) and won acquittal (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.132\">Dem. 18.132</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> goes on to say that, <quote>Had not the Council of the Areopagus, becoming aware of the facts, and seeing that you had made a most inopportune blunder, started further inquiries, arrested the man, and brought him into court a second time, the vile traitor would have slipped out of your hands and eluded justice, being smuggled out of the city by our bombastic phrase-monger</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.133\">Dem. 18.133</bibl>).
