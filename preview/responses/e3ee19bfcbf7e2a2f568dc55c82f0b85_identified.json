Free text responses were collected on: what it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds like being a&#13; part-time research student; what they would like from training events; and what they thought&#13; of this series of training days. The students were particularly appreciative of the opportunity&#13; to meet fellow part-time research students, albeit in different disciplines and at different&#13; stages of their PhD. Rather than solely listing specific research skills they would like&#13; covered, most of their ideas for future training sessions concerned more nebulous personal&#13; and emotional aspects of the experience of studying for a PhD on a part-time basis. Four&#13; dimensions of training need were identified: research techniques; research skills;&#13; engagement with the part-time PhD process; and engagement with their part-time peers. It is&#13; suggested that research training involving part-time research students, could usefully build&#13; in time to focus explicitly on some aspect(s) of the more personal and emotional elements of&#13; the part-time doctoral experience, as well as on technical aspects of research work. </summary> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>A qualitative study of the relationship of personality type with career management and career choice preference in a group of bioscience postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/229609\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Blackford, Sarah</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/229609</id> <updated>2013-07-25T13:39:07Z</updated> <published>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">A qualitative study of the relationship of personality type with career management and career choice preference in a group of bioscience postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers Blackford, Sarah This study reports on the career management and career choice preferences of a&#13; sample of bioscience postgraduate students and postdoctoral researchers according&#13; to their personality type as determined using the Myers Briggs Type Indicator&#13; (MBTI).

Postdoctoral researchers reported on their perceived skill&#13; levels, academic achievements, career motivations and the current research&#13; environment. Results indicated that transferable skills related to communication and&#13; awareness of the process of research (i.e. the process of acquisition of funding,&#13; commercialisation of research outputs) were lacking. Furthermore, these skills were&#13; associated with higher publication outputs, and improved with mobility between&#13; institutions at postdoctoral level. This paper also describes how the findings from the&#13; baseline evaluation were used to develop a programme to address the lower ranking&#13; skills and evaluate the impact of the programme. </summary> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>How much difference can current policy make to professional contract researchers?</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/229607\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Dear, Denise V</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/229607</id> <updated>2013-07-25T13:38:27Z</updated> <published>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">How much difference can current policy make to professional contract researchers? Dear, Denise V This article explores the role of the professional contract researcher in higher&#13; education. The factors which have led to the need for directed policy growth,&#13; the perceived consequences of these policies and the shortfalls of policy in&#13; practice. It begins by exploring the questions who are researchers, where do&#13; they work and what are their problems? It will then go on to describe the&#13; current policies targeting this cohort and highlight areas of policy which are&#13; expected to address some of the issues of concern. It will then identify areas&#13; where policy may continue to fall short in practice and address ways in which&#13; these gaps may be filled </summary> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
