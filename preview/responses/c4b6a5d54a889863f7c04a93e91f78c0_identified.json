It outputs calculated water depths and water velocities occurring within Weeks Bay due to tidal wave and fresh water boundary conditions.</abstract> <purpose>The purpose of the ADH model for Weeksbay is to generate simulations of water depths and water velocities throughout the bay for several scenarios of tidal and freshwater conditions.</purpose> <supplinf>Project abstract (Jeremy Sharp) Through the use of multiple models the goal is to present a clear defined approach for modeling an entire coastal watershed.  Determination of holistic watershed impacts is critical in understanding the dynamics and interactions among the transitions (surface water, water infiltration, groundwater, brackish effects, soil erosion, and sediment transport) in the system.  For examination of hydrology, hydrodynamics, and sediment, the demonstration site Weeks Bay, Alabama is selected.  Weeks Bay Watershed is a diverse environment that contains rapid urban development, agricultural use, and natural habitat.  Both urban and agriculture usage potentially increase runoff and change sedimentation behavior in the estuary, rivers, and watershed.  Determination and interaction of the surface flow, groundwater flow, and sediment flux require a multi-model approach for analysis. In this study five models, Gridded Surface/Subsurface Hydrologic Analysis(GSSHA), HSPF, ADH, Hec-Ras, and SBT, are implemented and interconnected to quantify flows and sedimentation tendencies for the  watershed-bay system.  Multiple models are used such that solutions are targeted in a way that inter-model validation is achievable. Currently, completed work consists of: 1-D and data oriented sediment budget for the tidally influenced surface waters; 2-D shallow water ADH model setup with preliminary runs; HSPF model of the watershed, and GSSHA model set up for the Magnolia Watershed.  Future work will consist of a 2-D shallow water ADH sediment model, and a 2-D surface water and groundwater GSSHA model.  By implementing these models the modelers will help direct future work, both locally in the study site and globally by demonstrating model connections for work at other locations.</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>2009</begdate> <enddate>2011</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>publication date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-87.903</westbc> <eastbc>-87.667</eastbc> <northbc>30.745</northbc> <southbc>30.354</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115</themekt> <themekey>environment</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>Watershed</themekey> <themekey>Hydrological Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF)</themekey> <themekey>Better Assessment Science Integrated Point &amp; Nonpoint Sources (BASINS)</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Weeks Bay watershed</placekey> <placekey>Baldwin County</placekey> <placekey>Alabama</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None, post publication by Orginators.</accconst> <useconst>Request that you acknowledge the Northern Gulf Institute as the source of this information.</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Northern Gulf Institute</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>NGI Program Office</address> <address>MSU Science and Technology Center</address> <address>1021 Balch Blvd.</address> <city>Stennis Space Center</city> <state>MS</state> <postal>39529</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>228.688.4218</cntvoice> <cntemail>program.office@ngi.msstate.edu</cntemail> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <browse> <browsen>http://www.ncddc.noaa.gov/approved_recs/edu/msu/gri/projects/BP_America10121360/BP_Phase_1/Vladimir_JeremyS/JeremySharp/Vladimir_Jeremy_Sharp_browse_Sharp_NGI_Poster_5_12_09.pdf</browsen> <browsed>Poster Jeremy Sharp presented at the 2009 Northern Gulf Institute Annual Conference in Mobile, Al</browsed> <browset>PDF</browset> </browse> </idinfo> <dataqual> <logic>No logical inconsistencies are known to exist in this data set.</logic> <complete>Complete</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>ADH (2-D model) This is a depth averaged  model that uses the Shallow Water Equations  on a finite element grid to solve for x and y velocity along with depth.
