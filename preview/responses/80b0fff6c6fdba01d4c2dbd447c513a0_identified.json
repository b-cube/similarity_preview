Presently, a GRI Google Earth KMZ/KML product doesn&apos;t exist for this map.  The data were completed as a component of the Geologic Resources Inventory (GRI) program, a National Park Service (NPS) Inventory and Monitoring (I&amp;M) Division funded program that is administered by the NPS Geologic Resources Division (GRD).  Source geologic maps and data used to complete this GRI digital dataset were provided by the following: Ohio Division of Geological Survey.  Detailed information concerning the sources used and their contribution the GRI product are listed in the Source Citation section(s) of this metadata record (sucu_metadata.txt; available at http://nrdata.nps.gov/geology/gri_data/gis/cuva/sucu_metadata.xml).  Users of this data are cautioned about the locational accuracy of features within this dataset.  Based on the source map scale of 1:62,500 and United States National Map Accuracy Standards features are within (horizontally) 31.8 meters or 104 feet of their actual location as presented by this dataset.  Users of this data should thus not assume the location of features is exactly where they are portrayed in ArcGIS or other software used to display this dataset.  All GIS and ancillary tables were produced as per the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1. (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  The GIS data is available as a 9.3 personal geodatabase (sucu_geology.mdb), and as shapefile (.SHP) and DBASEIV (.DBF) table files.  The GIS data projection is NAD83, UTM Zone 17N.  The data is within the area of interest of Cuyahoga National Park.</abstract> <purpose>The data are intended to assist NPS personnel in the protection and management of Cuyahoga National Park.</purpose> <supplinf>The data layers (feature classes) that comprise the Unpublished Digital Glacial and Surficial Geologic Map of Summit County and parts of Cuyahoga County, Ohio include: SUCUGAF (Glacial Area Features), SUCUGAFA (Glacial Area Feature Boundaries), SUCUSUR (Surficial Units), SUCUSURA (Surficial Contacts), SUCUCN1 (Structure Contours on Bedrock Surface), SUCUGFL (Glacial Feature Lines), SUCUGLF (Geologic Line Features), SUCUGFP (Glacial Feature Points) and SUCUMIN (Mine Point Features).  There are three additional ancillary map components, the Geologic Unit Information (SUCUUNIT) Table, the Source Map Information (CUVAMAP) Table and the Map PDF Document (cuva_geology.pdf).

Users of this data should thus not assume the location of features is exactly where they portrayed are in ArcGIS or other software used to display this dataset.  The PRECISION of any Shapefile (SHP) files is DOUBLE.  The maximum root mean square (RMS) horizontal accuracy of the georeferenced image as measured in ArcMap is 10.5600004196 meters.  Coordinate tics on the georeferenced (registered and rectified) source map image(s) were checked against control points that had the exact specified coordinates of the tic.  The direct distance between the image tic and its control point were measured.  All measured distances were less than 50% of the required distance to meet National Map Accuracy Standards (1/50th of an inch for maps at 1:20,000 scale and smaller).  Features were checked (QCd) after digitizing for positional accuracy errors using the georeferenced source map image.</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Ford, J.P.</origin> <pubdate>1987</pubdate> <title>Glacial and Surficial Geology of Cuyahoga County, Ohio</title> <edition>1st</edition> <geoform>map</geoform> <serinfo> <sername>NA</sername> <issue>Report of Investigations 134</issue> </serinfo> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Columbus, Ohio</pubplace> <publish>Ohio Division of Geological Survey (ODGS)</publish> </pubinfo> </citeinfo> </srccite> <srcscale>62500</srcscale> <typesrc>paper</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1987</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>publication date</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>ODGS Report of Investigations 134</srccitea> <srccontr>Geologic features present on the source map were digitized using a .TIF image of the paper/mylar map that was scanned at 300dpi and georeferenced in NAD83 UTM.

GIS features were digitized from a TIF image of the source map scanned at 300dpi and georeferenced in NAD83 UTM coordinates.  See the Source Information Contribution section(s) for specific source map details.  Geology features were digitized into a data model compliant geodatabase.  For details on the GRI data model see the NPS GRI Geology-GIS Geodatabase Data Model v. 2.1 (available at: http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/inventory/geology/GeologyGISDataModel.cfm).  2.) Line quality was checked against the source scan to ensure that GIS features were represented accurately, both positionally and spatially.  3.) Feature attribution was derived using the source map.  4.) Data Model topology rules were validated for all features and any topology errors corrected.  5.) Quality control (QC) consisting of a visual check of the data against its source, as well as running a GRI developed script (QC_Script) to check for GRI data model validation and feature-related consistency, was conducted.  6.) The UNIT and MAP tables were populated and checked against the source (s).  Relationship classes were also added and used to ensure attribution consistency between feature class and table attribution.  7.) Feature symbology was produced for all feature classes.  An attempt was made to best match symbology to its source map, however, in some cases feature symbology maybe slightly modified, primarily based on the limitations of the ArcGIS geology style.  In some cases, however, symbology may have been modified to reconcile differences from multiple sources.  8.) GIS feature classes were exported from the geodatabase to shapefile (SHP) format, and GIS tables exported to DBASEIV (DBF) format.  Layer (LYR) files were also exported.  9.) The ancillary map information PDF document, see the Supplemental Information section for additional information, was produced from textual information and figures present on the source map(s) and/or in digital data files.  If applicable, source map images were produced at 150dpi or greater resolution and optical character recognition (OCR) software was used to produce text from source map text.  The text, source map images and other ancillary source map information were added to a Help &amp; Manual (.HMXZ) template file.  The HMXZ file was then compiled to produce the ancillary map PDF document.  Any compilation errors were checked and corrected and the document was reviewed for content, usability and grammatical errors.</procdesc> <srcused>ODGS Report of Investigations 134, ODGS Report of Investigations 123</srcused> <procdate>20120619</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Georgia Hybels</cntper> <cntorg>NPS Geologic Resources Division</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>GIS Technician/Geographer</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype> <address>P.O.
