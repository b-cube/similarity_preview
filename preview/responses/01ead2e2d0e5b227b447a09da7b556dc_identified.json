The map, produced using GIS, shows where current drought areas are expected to improve, be removed, or persist with intensity, as well as new areas where drought may develop, at the end of the forecast period. The current drought areas are obtained from the most recent weekly U.S. Drought Monitor where drought is considered D1 (moderate drought) or worse. There are two narratives: a brief, general summary and a detailed, regional technical discussion that describes the thought process, forecast tools used, and confidence for each region on the map. These outlook products apply to the following 1-month period from the date of issue. The MDO replaced the updated SDO (which had been released on the first Thursday of the month) starting on June 30, 2013, with the MDO released on the last day of the month. The forecast applies to all 50 states of the United States plus Puerto Rico.</abstract> <purpose>To present a general picture of the overall drought tendency during the valid period.

The initial drought data is obtained from the latest U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) GIS shape files for drought areas D1 or worse from National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) in Lincoln, NE. A MDO verification score is made from the USDM at the end of the valid period. Originally, the category Some Improvement (which has been replaced since June 30, 2013) was not scored, and no verification is made for Hawaii, Alaska, or Puerto Rico as of August 2013. In short, the drought shape files from the USDM are compared with the MDO areas of improvement (removal is scored as improvement), persistence, and development to detect number of drought hits and misses (pixels) via the GIS spatial analyst. A hits versus misses score (%) is calculated, and then an outlook skill is determined from the score minus the persistence forecast baseline score. The MDO verifications (maps and statistics) have been archived by CPC since August 2013 (since first ever MDO was released on June 30, 2013), and are available upon request. Future plans include MDO verifications to be on the CPC web site.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>The MDO author is responsible for obtaining the most recent and final weekly US Drought Monitor D0 thru D4 shape files from the NDMC file server or USDM author and overlaying them on the MDO MXD. Once this is done, the author must determine whether to draw an area of Persistence, Improvement (at least one category improvement but drought remains), or Removal (no drought remains &#150; D0 or none) over the D1-D4 areas based upon future outlooks, forecasts, and analogs. The author can use the Snapping or Tracing options in ArcMap10 to precisely overlay their drought outlook areas to the borders of the D1 areas, and to other existing MDO areas. The author may also use the USDM&#146;s D0 areas as a guide for new drought Development areas. They may snap to the D0 lines, or not, depending if the author believes that drought will develop beyond the current border of D0 (abnormal dryness). However, there may be some slight overlapping of MDO areas, or some slight gaps between MDO areas depending upon how accurate (e.g. how many points) the author draws their MDO areas. Since this product is currently meant for a non-technical audience, no logical consistency tests are made on the MDO areas. But once all the MDO areas are drawn and final, a script is run to clip the areas to the US border so no MDO areas are over water or in Mexico or Canada.</logic> <complete>Quality control was performed on the most recent USDM shape files by NDMC as drought area input to the MDO. There is no quality control of the MDO shape files, but the MDO author cannot contradict CPC&#146;s 1-month precipitation outlook (e.g. show drought development where the updated monthly precipitation outlook favors wetness). Information about the NWS operational aspects of the MDO is contained in: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/directives/sym/pd01012002curr.pdf</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>Initial MDO drought areas (shape files) are obtained from the most recent USDM via ftp site from the NDMC in Lincoln, NE, and lastly from the USDM author on Wednesday. The MDO author use the D1 (moderate drought) to D4 (exceptional drought) areas, and manually draws for persistence, improvement, development, or removal using ArcMap/GIS for the current D1 areas. The D0 (abnormal dryness) areas are also overlaid on the US base map in case the MDO author believes that drought (D1 or drier) will develop by the end of the MDO outlook period. The latest ArcMap version (version 10) point snapping routine assures that the author will overlay the existing D1 areas. The large-scale drought trends are based upon subjectively derived probabilities guided by short and long-range statistical and dynamical forecasts. Data which contributes to the drought forecast includes the USDM, CPC long lead outlooks of precipitation and temperature, CPC medium range forecasts, La Nina and El Nino analogs, and various other climate and forecast products. The MDO cannot contradict CPC&#146;s one-month precipitation outlook for that period. The MDO GIS shape files are saved for archival, especially for verification once the MDO period ends and the applicable USDM is available for comparison.</procdesc> <procdate>2013</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Climate Prediction Center</cntorg> <cntper>David Miskus</cntper> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>physical</addrtype> <address>5830 University Research Court, Room 3146</address> <city>College Park</city> <state>MD</state> <postal>20740</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(301) 683-3453</cntvoice> <cnttdd>(301) 683-3453</cnttdd> <cntfax>(301) 683-1557 or 1558</cntfax> <cntemail>David.Miskus@noaa.gov</cntemail> <hours>8:30 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern</hours> <cntinst>Call the office or email</cntinst> </cntinfo> </proccont> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> </spdoinfo> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>The primary input parameters are the D1 (moderate drought) to D4 (exceptional drought) areas from the most recent USDM where the MDO author will create drought areas of persistence, improvement, or removal. The author may also use the USDM&#146;s D0 areas (abnormal dryness) to create areas of drought development. The MDO contains the U.S. drought tendency map, a general summary, and a detailed technical discussion. The citation is at: http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/expert_assessment/monthly_drought.html. The MDO output shape file layer is: D0_Merge_Clip, and its Attribute Table includes: FID_improv (Improvement), FID_persis (Persistence), FID_Remove (Removal), FID_dev (Development) where each shape file (or polygon area) is marked either 0 or 1 (0=not this category, 1=this category), and Fcst_Date (date in format dd/mm/yyyy) when this MDO was released), and Target (month this MDO was forecasted for, e.g. June 2013 = Jun 2013). On the final MDO, forecasted drought areas are both text labeled with arrows and colored: Persistence=Brown, Improvement=Brown and Green stripes, Development=Yellow, and Removal=Green.</eaover> <eadetcit>NOAA's Climate Prediction Center</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>NOAA's Climate Prediction Center</cntorg> <cntper>David Miskus</cntper> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype> <address>5830 University Research Court</address> <city>College Park</city> <state>Maryland</state> <postal>20740</postal> <country>United States of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(301) 683-3453</cntvoice> <cntemail>David.Miskus@noaa.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </distrib> <distliab>The user assumes the entire risk related to its use of this data.
