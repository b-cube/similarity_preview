The UKBMS comprises a suite of surveys carried out each year across the UK that generate data on butterfly abundance. The UKBMS started in 1976 (few sites from 1973) with thirty-six sites increasing to over a thousand by 2010. On the majority of these sites, recorders walk a fixed route (divided into up to 15 sections) at their site every week from 1st April to 29th September (total of 26 weeks), each year, counting butterflies within defined limits (5m box) when weather meets certain criteria. On some sites different survey techniques are employed to assess the abundance of species. These techniques include timed counts and larval web surveys in fixed areas. Weather data is recorded at the time of the count and habitat data is available for most transects. The surveys are undertaken by volunteers and other recorders, who contribute their data free of charge. The scheme is operated as a partnership between the Centre For Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC), and is jointly sponsored by a multi-agency consortium of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Natural Environment Research Council (through CEH), BC, Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Countryside Council for Wales, Natural England, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage. UKBMS data is widely used for research; a list of publications as well as downloadable PDF copies of past Annual Reports is made available via the UKBMS website. Datasets currently available for download are yearly calculations of species trends and collated indices of abundance, as well as yearly updated site data. Access to the full dataset should be requested directly from the UKBMS.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-06T09:13:09Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ada39609-ddec-4cbe-85c2-4fdd6bd774d7\">     <title>Cleaned UK Rainfall Chemistry Data (1986 - 2011)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ada39609-ddec-4cbe-85c2-4fdd6bd774d7</link>     <description>These data are based on the UK rainfall chemistry data held on the UK-AIR database operated on behalf of Defra (http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/). A subset of 20 sites was analysed, being those with the longest continuous data record from 1986 to 2011. Rainfall samples from bulk collectors were taken weekly or two-weekly at sites across the UK and analyzed by a central laboratory. The raw reported data contain some samples which were contaminated by bird droppings, or by wind-blown dust, and should not be used to estimate annual or long-term wet deposition at the measurement sites. Some samples were missing for other reasons, such as physical loss of the rain sample prior to analysis. Following identification and removal of contaminated sample data, the missing data were estimated, where possible, using statistical interpolation across both time and space with the GENSTAT procedure MULTMISSING. The final datasets contain the accepted and estimated data values, flagged as appropriate.  The dataset names correspond to the sites as listed in the UK-AIR database. This cleaned dataset was prepared by Neil Cape, Ron Smith and David Leaver at CEH Edinburgh on behalf of Defra and the Devolved Administrations under the project Pollutant Deposition Processes.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>David Leaver</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>cleaned dataset</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK National Rainfall Chemistry Network</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>PrecipNet</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-07-15T10:59:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/3f0820a7-a8c8-4dd7-a058-8db79ba9c7fe\">     <title>Five year record of aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations from Auchencorth Moss</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/3f0820a7-a8c8-4dd7-a058-8db79ba9c7fe</link>     <description>Dataset contains concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon, inorganic carbon, CO2, CH4 and N2O in the Black Burn stream which drains Auchencorth Moss peatland in South East Scotland.

The data cover stream and estuary survey locations sampled manually from 2007 to 2011 at varying intervals between fortnightly and quarterly. Survey locations were selected as draining the main landscape classes in the catchment, which include upland (&gt;300m) and lowland (&lt;300m) environments under trees, moorland or improved agriculture. Also included are a suite of locations on the major rivers, and in the estuary. The purpose of the data is to provide support for estimating loads and testing hypotheses relating to the relationship between subcatchment properties and water quality, and the relative importance of mixing and in-stream processes in influencing downstream water quality.   Streams draining peat, with high dissolved organic carbon concentrations, are well represented.  Upland drainage is generally acidic, and lowland circum-neutral. The lowland rivers are not heavily contaminated with nutrients, although they show evidence of some loss of nitrates in particular. There is little industry in the catchment beyond agriculture and tourism, though there is some legacy contamination from metal mines in a small part of the catchment.  Measurements are provided for major cations and anions, pH, alkalinity, DOC, Al, Fe and conductivity for most samples, with values for a wide range of trace elements for a limited number of samples.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conwy Catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>stream</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>lake</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>quarterly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC0454</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-07-26T09:21:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/68f4a12f-740d-4705-9c27-6a7fb7127046\">     <title>Vyrnwy research catchment hydrochemistry</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/68f4a12f-740d-4705-9c27-6a7fb7127046</link>     <description>This dataset includes weekly data from monitoring of stream, rainfall and groundwater hydrochemistry in the Vyrnwy research catchment between 1994 and 2001.
