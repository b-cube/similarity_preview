Traditionally, this speech has been included among the speeches of <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>. However, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Libanius</name> (a scholar of the <dateRange from=\"300\" to=\"399\">fourth century CE</dateRange>), in his hypothesis (or summary) of this speech, expresses doubt as to who really wrote it (but summarizes it along with <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>&#8217; speeches anyway): <quote>This speech is not attributed by anyone to Demosthenes, but here is its summary.</quote> (<quote lang=\"grc\">o( me\\  lo/gos ou)k a)nafe/retai para/ tinwn e)is to\\  *dhmosqe/nhn, u(po/qesin de\\\\ e)/xei tau/thn</quote>) (<bibl author=\"Libanius\" n=\"Libanius, 'Hypothesis to the Speech Against Phaenippus'\">Libanius, <title>Hypothesis to the Speech Against Phaenippus</title></bibl>). The speech itself is one composed for a plaintiff (whose name we do not know) who is suing <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> in order to make him perform certain <soCalled>liturgies</soCalled>, (<foreign lang=\"grc\">leitourgi/ai</foreign>) or public duties, that the plaintiff is unable to fulfill. It appears that both <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> and the plaintiff are important and wealthy men in the city of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>. During the year before the trial their fortunes take very different turns. The plaintiff lost 3 talents (see also <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>) in a mining investment when the city repossessed the mines. On the other hand, <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> acquired two very lucrative farming properties, one from his father <name type=\"person\">Callippus</name> and the other from his adoptive father, the orator <name type=\"person\">Philostratus</name>. Because of his reverses, the plaintiff claimed to be too poor to perform the liturgy that had been assigned him. Athenian law provided options in this situation. He had the right to nominate someone else who was financially able to take his place. If that person claimed to be too poor, the one originally assigned the liturgy could ask that the two of them exchange property. This exchange was called the <soCalled>antidosis</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">a)ntido/sis</foreign>). The procedures of the antidosis were as follows. The generals (<foreign lang=\"grc\">oi( strathgoi/</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 42\" n=\"Dem. 42.5\">Dem. 42.5</bibl>) appointed a court date at which the plaintiff cited <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> for the exchange of property. Before the trial, each party completed an exact inventory of all property owned subject to an inspection by the other party. At this point, according to the plaintiff, <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> stated that there were no outstanding debts that he owed and he allowed the plaintiff to tour his extensive and prosperous lands, complete with wine and grain production and a timber industry. But, by the time that the trial arrived, mortgage-pillars appeared on <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name>&#8217; land and <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> had <soCalled>discovered</soCalled> almost three talents of debt that he owed to various parties. Furthermore, two full storerooms of grain had gone missing from <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name>&#8217; property. All of this was very disturbing to the plaintiff who merely wanted the property to which he was entitled under the provisions of the law. During the trial, the plaintiff produced much evidence which disproved <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name>&#8217; claims of financial obligations and showed, rather, that <name type=\"person\">Phaenippus</name> led a profligate lifestyle, spending all of his money on fast chariots (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 42\" n=\"Dem. 42.24\">Dem. 42.24</bibl>) without any regard for the public good. We have no way of dating this speech more precisely than the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">fourth century BCE</dateRange>.</p> <byline>Christopher Cotten</byline> </div0>   </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
