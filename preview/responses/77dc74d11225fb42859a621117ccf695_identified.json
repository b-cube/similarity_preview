There  is a close similarity among the questionnaires administered in these  countries, many items being identical. The present study was conducted  in 1966 in Paraguay. The respondents' educational backgrounds were  explored through extensive questions about their secondary school  attendance and the level of education attained by their parents and  grandparents. The value that students placed on education and on the  university in general was examined in variables probing the importance  of completing a degree, the main functions of an academic institution,  and the respondents' professional prospects and expectations after  graduation. Other questions elicited the respondents' views on faculty  and student involvement in politics. A major portion of the study  assessed the students' perspectives on national and international  affairs. Respondents gave their opinions about specific issues  affecting their country, such as agrarian reform, the role of the  national government, the benefits of foreign capital, and the  advantages of joining the Latin American Free Trade  Association. Further variables explored the students' views on  international issues, such as the Cuban Revolution and aspects of the  social, economic, and cultural development of several world  powers. Finally, several questions probed the respondents'  perspectives on life, social relations and family ties, and moral and  religious matters, as well as their tendencies toward progressive  political thinking. Demographic variables include age, sex, marital status, number of siblings, religion, and occupation, if applicable.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1966\" cycle=\"P1\">1966</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1966\" cycle=\"P1\">1966</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Latin America</geogCover>             <geogCover>Paraguay</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Students from Universidad de Asuncion, Paraguay.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          self-enumerated questionnaires             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>               <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR07061.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
