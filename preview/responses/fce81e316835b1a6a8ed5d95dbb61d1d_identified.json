Miller, Dan Taninecz I will argue that the SCO is not failing as security organization (as many have claimed) but is in fact pivoting towards security and intelligence functions aimed at repressing subversive elements and domestic threats under the auspices of the Chinese three evils doctrine of separatism, extremism and terrorism. This paper identifies significant developments within the SCO and analyzes their security, intelligence and human rights implications. The SCO's normative documents show extensive security designs, and recent diplomatic information and quantitative media analysis data suggest these goals are bearing fruit. Realities on the ground over the SCO's lifespan indicate collective security cooperation that aligns with self-described goals for the organization as well as major players like the PRC. I argue that such development in security functionality is the result of shared domestic insecurity across SCO member-state territory and security functions are increasingly emphasized by Beijing.

The two main dialects with which we&#13; are here dealing are Khalkha and Chakhar. The former is the predominant&#13; dialect of Outer Mongolia, and the latter of Inner Mongolia.

I will show the consolidation of Kim Il Sung's power by examining the pattern of changes in the membership of the Central Committee of Workers' Party of Korea, also known as the Korean Workers' Party. In Chapters 1 to 4, I will look at four significant time periods in post-World War II Korean history and the membership in the corresponding Party Congresses that occurred during that time. The events are as follows: 1) the end of the World War II (1945-1950) and membership in the First and Second Congress in 1946 and 1948; 2) the Korean War (1950-1953) and membership in the Third Congress in 1956; 3) the Sino-Soviet Dispute (1950s, 60s, 70s) and membership in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Congresses in 1961, 1970, 1980 respectively and 4) the Seoul Olympics (1980s) and members in the Political Leadership.
