A key discovery of the Kepler mission is of the circumbinary planets known as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTatooines\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, which appear to be well aligned with their host stars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd orbits. Whether this alignment is due to initially coplanar circumbinary planet-forming discs (i.e. nature), or subsequent alignment of initially misaligned discs by warping the inner disc or torquing the binary (i.e. nurture), is not known. Tests of which scenario dominates may be possible by observing circumbinary Kuiper belt analogues (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddebris discs\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd), which trace the plane of the primordial disc. Here, the 140 au diameter circumbinary debris disc around HD 131511 is shown to be aligned to within 10\\ufffd\\ufffd of the plane of the near edge-on 0.2 au binary orbit. The stellar equator is also consistent with being in this plane. If the primordial disc was massive enough to pull the binary into alignment, this outcome should be common and distinguishing nature versus nurture will be difficult. However, if only the inner disc becomes aligned with the binary, the HD 131511 system was never significantly misaligned. Given an initial misalignment, the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGyr mainsequence lifetime of the star allows secular perturbations to align the debris disc out to 100 au at the cost of an increased scaleheight. The observed debris disc scaleheight limits any misalignment to less than 25\\ufffd\\ufffd. With only a handful known, many more such systems need to be characterized to help test whether the alignment of circumbinary planets is nature or nurture.

Likelihood surfaces in the parameter space of gravitational wave signals can contain many secondary&#13; maxima, which can prevent search algorithms from finding the global peak and correctly&#13; mapping the distribution. Traditional schemes to mitigate this problem maintain the number of secondary&#13; maxima and thus retain the possibility that the global maximum will remain undiscovered.&#13; By contrast, the recently proposed technique of likelihood transform can modify the structure of&#13; the likelihood surface to reduce its complexity. We present a practical method to carry out a likelihood&#13; transform using a Gaussian smoothing kernel, utilising gravitational wave surrogate models to&#13; perform the smoothing operation analytically. We demonstrate the approach with Newtonian and&#13; post-Newtonian waveform models for an inspiralling circular compact binary. This is the accepted manuscript.

We use simulations of the formation of the Oort cloud to show that \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd4\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdper\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcent of the small bodies in the Oort cloud should have formed within 2.5 au of the Sun, and hence be ice-free rock-iron bodies. If we assume that these Oort cloud asteroids have the same size distribution as their cometary counterparts, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope should find roughly a dozen Oort cloud asteroids during 10 years of operations. Measurement of the asteroid fraction within the Oort cloud can serve as an excellent test of the Solar system's formation and dynamical history. Oort cloud asteroids could be of particular concern as impact hazards as their high mass density, high impact velocity, and low visibility make them both hard to detect and hard to divert or destroy. However, they should be a rare class of object, and we estimate globally catastrophic collisions should only occur about once per billion years. This is the final published version.
