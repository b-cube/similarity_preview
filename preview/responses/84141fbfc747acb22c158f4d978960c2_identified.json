Addressing the need for a unified search, these services use an aggregated meta-index and enable users to query a wide range of resources \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd both licensed and free \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd from multiple providers. Discovery services have largely supplanted the previous generation of metasearch systems and offer superior performance, much wider search scope and no limit on the number of results retrieved by the system. Although these relatively new discovery services have been widely adopted by libraries on a global basis, the ODI recommendations should assist with the further development of this industry. This article provides some background for the ODI, a summary of the published recommendations, and a call to action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Jenny Walker</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-05</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-05</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/uksg.222\">        <title>Could we ever get rid of usage statistics?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/uksg.222</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;UKSG is pleased to be able to publish the winning entry in the Usus Travel Award competition, sponsored by COUNTER.

Considering the existing subscription publication ecosystem as a risk/cost-pooling mechanism leads to the conclusion that APCs are a concentration of risk that may come with damaging institutional consequences, particularly in the humanities disciplines. Consortial and co-operative modes of funding gold OA, however, do not come with these drawbacks but are susceptible to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfree riders\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. In this article, the theoretical backdrop to these models is addressed and the range of current offerings evaluated.

Various topics within research communication, such as open access (OA) and post-publication peer review (PPPR), are considered from the perspective of the authors as participants in the scholarly communication community of more than 20 years\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd standing, with both for- and non-profit credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors explore how harnessing the wisdom of the crowd in rating everyday services manifests itself by improving our ability to make choices in our daily lives. They explain how this network effect can be applied to scholarly communication and how it provided some of the inspiration behind the launch of ScienceOpen, the research and OA publishing network, in May 2014. This publishing platform is then described as an example of democratizing publishing. The increasing importance of software development in publishing and the need for stand-alone expertise in this space (as opposed to a publisher-centric approach) is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the authors consider the role that the impact factor and the promotion/tenure system play in holding back progress in scholarly communication and they highlight the efforts of early career researchers to break the stalemate by taking \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdopen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd pledges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Liz Allen</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Stephanie Dawson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-05</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-05</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/uksg.218\">        <title>Europeana Newspapers: searching digitized historical newspapers from 23 European countries</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/uksg.218</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Europeana Newspapers is a European Commission-funded project which is refining, aggregating and giving researchers online access to historical newspaper content from 23 European libraries. It also offers free, open source tools which individual libraries can use to assess refinement quality and metadata standards in relation to their own digital newspaper collections. The content made available by the project is available both through Europeana and a dedicated newspaper browser. Europeana is a way to see the newspapers in the context of over 30 million other items of cultural heritage, while the dedicated browser hosted on The European Library site gives researchers the possibility to refine their search terms (e.g. by date, publishing country, issue) and to search the full text of many newspapers. So far, the browser, which has been online for approximately one year, has proven popular with researchers, and further improvements to its functionality are planned in 2015. This could include the ability for users to tag articles or to edit, and help correct, the full text of individual articles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Marieke Willems</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Rossitza Atanassova</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2015-03-05</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2015-03-05</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/uksg.217\">        <title>The Global Open Knowledgebase (GOKb): open linked data supporting electronic resources management and scholarly communication</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/uksg.217</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The Global Open Knowledgebase (GOKb), a partnership between Kuali OLE and Jisc, is an open data repository of information related to e-resources as they are acquired and managed by libraries.

France, along with the rest of the world, has faced huge price increases in the acquisition of academic electronic resources during the last decade, and its institutions are now finding it difficult to pay to access them. The Ministry has therefore decided to invest in an extensive electronic archives acquisition programme in order to give the academic and research community nationwide access to a very large corpus of data in all disciplines. This project will consist of two phases: acquisition of the archives themselves and the development of a single platform to host the data. This platform will offer seamless unique access to all the resources purchased and will provide a range of efficient services to researchers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Andr\\ufffd\\ufffd Dazy</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-03</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-03</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.172\">        <title>The open library and its enemies</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.172</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;In the age of electronics an open society \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd one in which questions can be asked, where critical thinking is not just permitted but encouraged and where investigation rather than ideology is used to seek out the truth about the world (the open society according to Karl Popper) \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd has also to be an open data society because reusable, structured data has become the main machine for doing the heavy lifting of moving knowledge around, just as books move ideas around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An open library is one that embodies the Open Definition in its working practices, one that is available and accessible, open to all participants, and which offers services that can be freely shared.

These tools are designed to change the research experience, yet very few studies have investigated the impact of discovery service implementation. This study examines one aspect of that impact by asking whether usage of publisher-hosted journal content changes after implementation of a discovery tool. Libraries that have begun using the four major discovery services have seen an increase in usage of this content, suggesting that for this particular type of material, discovery services have a positive impact on use. Though all discovery services significantly increased usage relative to a no discovery service control group, some had a greater impact than others, and there was extensive variation in usage change among libraries using the same service. Future phases of this study will look at other types of content.</description>            <dc:creator>Michael Levine-Clark</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>John Mcdonald</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Jason S Price</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-03</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-03</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.178\">        <title>Managing open access (OA) workflows at the University of St Andrews: challenges and Pathfinder solutions</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.178</link>            <description>This article arose out of a presentation given to the UKSG seminar on \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdManaging Open Access: pain points and workflows\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

It looks at the overall policy for managing these funds at the University and at the systems and processes set in place by the University Library to deal with this new area of activity. There are significant challenges for institutions in managing individual APCs and the article discusses some of these challenges. The new Research Excellence Framework (REF) policy on open access was introduced in March 2014 and will have implications for the management of open access by institutions.

In an attempt to better understand the impact of e-books on student outputs, citation analysis was performed on coursework to identify the e-books that had been used. Of the students surveyed, 11.6% cited an e-book in their work and, for this particular group, EBL was found to be the most popular collection. However, cross reference with the Library discovery tool and Google revealed that e-books available from the web were cited more than those from library collections. Interviews uncovered a spectrum of usage, leading to the conclusion that a comprehensive e-book strategy is required that makes students aware of their benefits, equips them with the skills needed for effective use and increases the number of e-books available.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Antony Groves</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.131\">        <title>The university as publisher revisited</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.131</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;This article explores the growing involvement of libraries in providing publishing services for the informal scholarly outputs traditionally referred to as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgray literature\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. By envisioning institutional repository (IR) infrastructure as a publishing platform, libraries can bring conference proceedings, technical reports, niche journals, white papers and other hard-to-source materials into the mainstream. The opportunities of such an approach for scholars, libraries and university presses open to collaboration are considered. Several directions for future expansion of this activity, such as the publication of student scholarship and the development of more formal products linked to gray literature, are suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Charles Watkinson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.180\">        <title>People</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.180</link>                <dc:creator>John Jardine</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.179\">        <title>Editorial</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.179</link>                <dc:creator>Lorraine Estelle</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Steve Sharp</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.176\">        <title>People in the News - Emily Gore</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.176</link>                    <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.168\">        <title>A day in the life of &lt;i&gt;a Co-ordinator, Scholarly Communications&lt;/i&gt; </title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.168</link>                <dc:creator>Amy Buckland</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.162\">        <title>Is rational discussion of open access possible?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.162</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Open Access (OA), like any other model or strategy for the dissemination of knowledge, carries with it clear benefits as well as costs and downsides. These vary depending on the OA strategy in question, and in order for OA to bring maximum benefit to the world of scholarship, its costs and benefits need be examined carefully and dispassionately so that the former can be maximized and the latter minimized. Unfortunately, the OA advocacy community tends to resist all attempts to examine OA in this way, to the point that those who approach OA in a spirit of critical analysis (rather than celebration and evangelism) are attacked and punished. This article describes the problem, provides examples of it, and proposes strategies for promoting a more rigorous and analytical discussion of OA.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Rick Anderson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-07-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-07-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.97\">        <title>Digitization: a successful collaborative partnership between library and publisher</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.97</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;While archives across the UK are recognizing the potential of digitization to unlock their treasures, the realities of a large-scale digitization project can be daunting for any institution.

This has given the Library many new opportunities, but we have also come across some challenges that we have needed to address. A new role implies many new considerations, and gives the Library the opportunity to develop the way it works and the services it provides. Libraries such as ours have excellent opportunities to really contribute to the development of our universities by offering our expertise in the fields of literature acquisition including open access (OA), metadata and archiving, information literacy and student support, ICT and pedagogy.

Digital media have dramatically improved access to historic texts but library e-books are frustrating due to software and loan arrangements. Authors of illustrated books risk losing control of book design, although new media offer opportunities to improve image quality and access. Alfred Tennyson&#039;s career shows that authors have been sensitive about the physical form of their work since the Victorian period and ignoring the material significance of the book could make us overlook the fundamental changes that the e-book represents. Monographs retain value as a way of evaluating substantive research projects and those published through the OA process will have great advantages over the commercial e-book. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGreen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd OA publishing is impractical for humanities scholars and funded \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgold\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd OA publishing is likely to involve a labour-intensive application process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Dr Jim Cheshire</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.163\">        <title>Open access monographs and the role of the library</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.163</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;If open access (OA) books are to succeed, they need to operate in a way that works for academic libraries. Humanities researchers rely upon libraries to help them find and access many of the books they need for their research. Furthermore, many business models require direct input from librarians in the form of funding for first-copy costs or alternative formats. This article uses interviews with librarians and repository managers at four UK universities to consider some key issues for OA monographs from the point of view of librarians, and concludes with a reflection on these findings from the point of view of the University of Huddersfield&#039;s Library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Ellen Collins</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Graham Stone</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.120\">        <title>Building it together: collaboration in university-based open access book publishing</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.120</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Open access (OA) book publishing in the humanities and social sciences is becoming technically more feasible and financially more desirable. After securing funding for the development of a business model based on a pilot book series, the University of Heidelberg is joining this development and building an infrastructure to publish OA books on campus. The challenges facing such new publishing outlets are considerable. This article argues that the best strategy to build the prestige, affordability and competitiveness necessary to succeed is collaboration. Accomplishing this within the OA community will prove less difficult than extending collaboration beyond it because many agencies and individuals still lack information about, and are often unconvinced of, the merits of open access. The key lies in offering excellence in manuscript development to revitalize the most important collaboration of all: that between publisher and author.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Dr Andrea Hacker</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.164\">        <title>How should we fund open access monographs and what do you think is the most likely way that funding will happen?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.164</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The contributors to the &lt;em&gt;Insights OA monograph supplement&lt;/em&gt; were invited to respond to this question, and their thought-provoking and sometimes conflicting replies below make interesting reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Michael C R Davies</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Paul Ayris</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Graham Stone</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Jim Cheshire</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Rhodri Jackson</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Andrea Hacker</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Mercedes Bunz</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Eelco Ferwerda</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Hazel Newton</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Marin Dacos</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Pierre Mounier</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Yrsa Neuman</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.46\">        <title>Open access monograph business models</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.46</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, a number of business models have been developed for open access (OA) monographs in the humanities and social sciences (HSS).

However, it does present some challenges to the traditional model of monograph publication in the humanities and social sciences. In common with many other academic institutions, the University of Sussex is developing policies that will permit it to embrace OA publication. This paper describes how, in doing this, Sussex is addressing the challenges associated with OA to ensure that the careers of doctoral students, academics and researchers are not affected adversely by the change in the publishing landscape for monographs both in the UK and internationally.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Professor Michael C R Davies</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.118\">        <title>Snapshots of three open access business models</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.118</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from Eelco Ferwerda&#039;s introduction to different OA monograph business models ( &lt;a href=&quot;http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.46&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://dx.doi.org/10.1629/2048-7754.46&lt;/a&gt;), Hazel Newton (Palgrave Macmillan), Marin Dacos and Pierre Mounier (OpenEdition Books) and Yrsa Neuman (\\ufffd\\ufffdbo Akademi University) explain the different OA business models that they are currently working with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Hazel Newton</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Marin Dacos</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Pierre Mounier</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Yrsa Neuman</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.117\">        <title>The publisher journey for OUP</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.117</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;The journey towards open access (OA) monograph publishing is incomplete. Since the publication of the Finch Report and in an environment of improving funding for OA monographs, publishers have made tentative moves into the OA monograph space, but there are a number of questions to be answered before one or more truly successful and sustainable business models can be identified. Oxford University Press (OUP) is a large monograph publisher, and has been publishing OA journals for a decade. It is only in the last year though that OUP has made significant moves towards OA monograph publishing, participating in the OAPEN-UK project and considering other options. The challenge for OUP and the publishing industry is to work with authors, funders and other interested parties to develop OA monograph publishing options which work for all involved and safeguard the future of a crucial element of the scholarly publishing landscape.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Rhodri Jackson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.122\">        <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Returned\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: on the future of monographic books</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.122</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;This article evaluates the current state of academic book publishing based on the findings of the Hybrid Publishing Lab&#039;s business model research. With students relying more and more on Google and Wikipedia, the role of books within today&#039;s university studies is a difficult one. From the perspective of publishers, open access (OA) embracing the digital is seen as one potential way to bridge this gap between online search engines and traditional monographs. To illustrate this further, the article delivers an overview of its findings, which highlight changes in academic publishing: publishers have switched their emphasis from delivering a product to creating a service, whereby the author rather than the reader becomes their most focused-on customer. Research frameworks, funding and conventions about academic careers, however, often still need to adjust to this new development. If these frameworks acknowledge and foster OA publishing, and new experiments with collaborative book productions flourish, the monograph will have a future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Mercedes Bunz</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.140\">        <title>Open access e-books: the role of the institution</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.140</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;This article explains the policy position taken by University College London (UCL) in establishing the UCL Press. It sets the creation of the Press against the background of national open access (OA) policy development in the UK. UCL Press, repatriated from a commercial provider, was relaunched as an OA press as part of UCL Library Services on 1 August 2013. The Press will publish both OA electronic journals and OA monographs, with a particular emphasis in the latter on the arts, humanities and social sciences. UCL is largely funding Press activity from its own internal funds, seeing OA as an opportunity rather than a threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Paul Ayris</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-04-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-04-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.115\">        <title>Open access for REF2020</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.115</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Open access (OA) may have been the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbig thing\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in 2013 but the OA juggernaut is still rolling and plans are now afoot for the requirements for the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnext REF\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (which from now on we will refer to as REF2020).

As a major scientific publishing country with its estimated 5,000 STM journals, China&#039;s place in the international OA publishing scene is considered in detail, with the author concluding that he believes open access to publicly funded research in China will soon become the accepted norm, as all levels of scientific policymakers fulfil their political, professional and international responsibilities, to the benefit of Chinese research and society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Dr Xiaolin Zhang</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-03-03</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-03-03</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.114\">        <title>Seeking a fresh perspective: a research funder&#039;s view of open access</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.114</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;For open access (OA) to become a reality, all stakeholders will need to engage positively with each other to rise to the substantial practical challenges it brings.

As an academic, the author feels it is essential that scholars embrace the responsibility of being part of the process that reconsiders how to publish their research, and that they recognize they have a key role to play amongst a variety of stakeholders. The launch of the Open Library of Humanities (OLH) in early 2013 and its growing momentum as a scholarly-led movement over the last 12 months demonstrates that there is an increasing awareness amongst the academic community in the humanities of what is required to build a new kind of publishing model. Aspects of this \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddo-it-yourself\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd culture are considered along with various funding options, concluding with a look at international challenges facing the transformation towards open access and where the OLH fits into the picture.</description>            <dc:creator>Caroline Edwards</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-03-03</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-03-03</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.137\">        <title>How are universities putting policy into practice, from both library and research perspectives?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.137</link>            <description>This paper briefly outlines the experience of a large research-intensive university working towards wider adoption of open access. OA has featured in the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds research strategy for several years, but there was a step change in the level of activity following the Finch Report and subsequent policy announcements from RCUK and HEFCE. For individual researchers, OA presents a number of practical challenges that universities must work to overcome.

Many have described how publishers were caught on the back foot by the move of open access (OA) from the fringes of publishing to the mainstream, particularly within the UK following the publication of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFinch\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Report. OA has had a marked influence on the publishing industry, leading publishers to reflect on current practices, to have a much more granular approach to systems and processes, and to be engaging even more than previously with other players in the publishing landscape. OA is both a strategic challenge and an opportunity. But for a publisher like Taylor &amp;amp; Francis with a significant number of subscription-based journals, OA creates new levels of complexity, and requires the ability to adapt to new requirements within short timeframes.</description>            <dc:creator>Victoria Gardner</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>David Green</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-03-03</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-03-03</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.139\">        <title>The future is open: opportunities for publishers and institutions</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.139</link>            <description>The growth of open access (OA) has created a unique opportunity for publishers and institutions to collaborate and deliver real change to the way science is disseminated and built upon. OA allows institutions to share and evaluate the research performed by their researchers as never before. Through OA, research can now reach readers from all walks of life, from all countries of the world. Combined with article-level metrics, authors and institutions are able to see the full reach of their research, beyond the traditional channels of citations and journal impact factors (IFs). However, the drive by policymakers to implement OA presents significant challenges to institutions and publishers. These challenges mean that the future of OA is by no means certain, and it is now up to funders, institutions and authors to work together to ensure the potential of OA is fully realized.</description>            <dc:creator>Damian Pattinson</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Catriona J MacCallum</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-03-03</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-03-03</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.70\">        <title>Research data management for libraries: getting started</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.70</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Many libraries are keen to take on new roles in providing support for effective research data management (RDM), but lack the necessary skills and resources to do so. This article explores the approach used by the University of Sussex to engage with academic departments about their RDM practices and requirements in order to develop relevant library support services. It describes a project undertaken with three Academic Schools to inform a list of recommendations for senior management, to include areas which should be taken forward by the Library, IT and Research Office in order to create a sustainable RDM service.

Beyond the research community itself, scholarly information has an impact on other professionals, as well as on the general public. Traditional measures do not reflect these wider impacts. The mission of COUNTER is to set and monitor global standards for the measurement of online usage of content. Usage is an important measure of the impact and value of publications, and as such has a role in altmetrics. Usage can be reported at the individual item and individual researcher level and aggregated to the journal or institution level. PIRUS and Usage Factor are two COUNTER-lead initiatives that are based on this approach, with the potential to provide useful altmetrics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Peter Shepherd</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.72\">        <title>Key Issue - PIE-J, Presentation and Identification of E-Journals: what&#039;s the point?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.72</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&lt;/a&gt;), which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Regina Romano Reynolds</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.96\">        <title>Digitization: surely it can\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt be that difficult?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.96</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;With some five million collections items comprising art, film, photographs, sound, new media, writings and objects, the possibilities which digitization opens up for the Imperial War Museums (IWM) are only limited by the imagination: new ways of reaching and engaging with audiences, slicker commercial activities, online access to superbly restored film and photographic images. But without the financial clout of a Google-style business, and where systems and standards are still very much in development, heritage institutions struggle to bridge the gulf between aspiration and reality. Hiding behind the term digitization lies a mass of activities and responsibilities, all critical to its success. With several years of experience of digitizing anything from posters to motion picture film, and of capturing high-quality digital images of a range of objects from medals to missiles, IWM has now learnt, often the hard way, most of the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>David Walsh</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.126\">        <title>Profile - Fran\\ufffd\\ufffdoise Pell\\ufffd\\ufffd</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.126</link>                    <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.125\">        <title>People in the News - Roly Keating</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.125</link>                    <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.109\">        <title>How libraries use publisher metadata</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.109</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;With the proliferation of electronic publishing, libraries are increasingly relying on publisher-supplied metadata to meet user needs for discovery in library systems. However, many publisher/content provider staff creating metadata are unaware of the end-user environment and how libraries use their metadata. This article provides an overview of the three primary discovery systems that are used by academic libraries, with examples illustrating how publisher-supplied metadata directly feeds into these systems and is used to support end-user discovery and access. Commonly seen metadata problems are discussed, with recommendations suggested. Based on a series of presentations given in Autumn 2012 to the staff of a large publisher, this article uses the University of Washington Libraries systems and services as illustrative examples. Judging by the feedback received from these presentations, publishers (specifically staff not familiar with the big picture of metadata standards work) would benefit from a better understanding of the systems and services libraries provide using the data that is created and managed by publishers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Steve Shadle</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.127\">        <title>A day in the life of &lt;i&gt;the curator of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Digitalpreservation Daily\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and content delivery librarian&lt;/i&gt; </title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.127</link>                <dc:creator>Phil Adams</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.99\">        <title>Research information meets research data management \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the library?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.99</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Research data management (RDM) is a major priority for many institutions as they struggle to cope with the plethora of pronouncements including funder policies, a G8 statement, REF2020 consultations, all stressing the importance of open data in driving everything from global innovation through to more accountable governance; not to mention the more direct possibility that non-compliance could result in grant income drying up.

More broadly, the journal &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; has a mandate to experiment and to be a catalyst for innovation in all aspects of scholarly communication. &lt;em&gt;eLife&lt;/em&gt; has now been publishing for just under a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (&lt;a href=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0&lt;/a&gt;), which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Mark Patterson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.91\">        <title>Open access in Australia: an odyssey of sorts?</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.91</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Scholarly communication change and open access (OA) initiatives in Australia have followed an Odyssean path in the last decade. The stop-start nature of early initiatives demonstrates that institutional leadership is essential for the successful deposit of academic content in an institutional repository. Similarly, OA policies from the two Australian Research Councils were delayed for nearly a decade, partly due to publisher pressure and bureaucratic conservatism. More successful has been the development of full, or hybrid, open access university e-presses. These presses, usually embedded in the scholarly infrastructure of the university, provide monographic models for wider global consideration. Australian universities are now reflecting, partly through recent Research Council edicts and monitoring global OA developments, greater awareness of the need for action in scholarly communication change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Colin Steele</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.104\">        <title>Being a paperless medic</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.104</link>            <description>Am I the student of the future?

The mission of ORCID is to address the name ambiguity problem in research and scholarly communication. ORCID works with the research community to embed identifiers in research workflows: grant applications, manuscript submissions, association membership renewal, meeting abstract submission, everywhere that a person can be connected with a research or scholarly contribution. This article describes ORCID, and its adoption by the research community, and provides examples of how ORCID identifiers are being integrated by organizations throughout the community and becoming part of the metadata on a diverse set of documents. Ultimately, the goal of ORCID is to improve discoverability, reduce repetitive data entry, and thereby allow researchers and organizations more time to focus on research and scholarly pursuits.</description>            <dc:creator>Laurel L Haak</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-11-06</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-11-06</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.71\">        <title>Maximizing the knowledge base: Knowledge Base+ and the Global Open Knowledgebase</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.71</link>            <description>The motivation for the two projects discussed in this article is the simple premise that the current inaccuracies of data in the library supply chain are detrimental to the user experience, limit the ability of institutions to effectively manage their collections and that resolving them is increasingly unsustainable at the institutional level.

With the leadership and substantial support of CERN, the community&#039;s Geneva-based hub, the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) has created an innovative model for OA publishing. Whereas the journal subscriptions of today implicitly support the important process of peer review, the new model federates funding agencies and libraries to cover journals&#039; professional publication costs explicitly, while publishers make the electronic versions of their journals free to read. Authors are not directly charged to publish their articles OA. Each SCOAP&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; partner will finance its contribution by canceling journal subscriptions, and each country will contribute according to its share of HEP publishing. The project is now embarked on a complex finessing process on the route to the projected 2014 launch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Ralf Schimmer</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-07-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-07-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.80\">        <title>Enlighten: research and APC funding workflows at the University of Glasgow</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.80</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;This paper provides an overview of the research funding and article processing workflows provided by the University of Glasgow&#039;s open source institutional repository \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Enlighten \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and how these have evolved, in particular with the recent introduction of the Research Councils UK (RCUK) open access policy.

The reasons for this are many, including a perception by library vendors that libraries themselves move slowly and feel no sense of urgency to innovate on behalf of patrons. The ever improving consumer media experience is the biggest competitor to the role of the library in the future. There are clear steps both public and academic libraries can take to remediate this, including demanding faster innovation from vendors, finding new roles for themselves in the content value chain and finding balance between the practicalities of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrunning a media business\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and the larger mission of the library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Mitchell Davis</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-07-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-07-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.61\">        <title>350 years at the cutting edge of scientific publishing \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the Royal Society moves to continuous publication</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.61</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdContinuous publication\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is a digital-friendly concept that does exactly what it says on the tin.

These articles are no longer constrained by the traditional print schedule, which means that citation details are available straight away and the reader has confidence that they are reading the version of record. A number of newly launched journals have experimented with a continuous format over the past few years, although to see established journals making the switch to a different publication model is still rare. So when the Royal Society, publisher of the world&#039;s first science journal, decided to transition its titles to a continuous publication model, it was a bold move.

Complementing traditional citation analysis, altmetrics are intended to reflect more broad views of research impact by taking into account the use of digital scholarly communication tools. Aggregating online attention paid to individual scholarly articles and data sets is the approach taken by Altmetric LLP, an altmetrics tool provider. Potential uses for article-level metrics collected by Altmetric include: 1) the assessment of an article&#039;s impact within a particular community, 2) the assessment of the overall impact of a body of scholarly work, and 3) the characterization of entire author and reader communities that engage with particular articles online. Although attention metrics are still being refined, qualitative altmetrics data are beginning to illustrate the rich new world of scholarly communication, and are emerging as ways to highlight the immediate societal impacts of research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Jean Liu</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Euan Adie</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-07-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-07-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.69\">        <title>RDA: an innovation in cataloguing</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.69</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;With effect from 31 March 2013, Resource Description and Access (RDA) has become the cataloguing content standard used by the British Library and the Library of Congress.

After a decade in which academic librarians have found it hard to get open access on to the university agenda, it is now difficult to get it off. University senior managers and researchers are all preoccupied with it to an unprecedented degree. Policy decisions are being made by government, funders and universities themselves which will have profound implications for the future in a context that is complex, fast moving and beset with misconceptions. In this article, the author tries to shine some light on the issues under consideration and offer some prescriptions for future progress.</description>            <dc:creator>Phil Sykes</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-07-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-07-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.65\">        <title>Mining for gold: identifying the librarians\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd toolkit for managing hybrid open access</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.65</link>            <description>In 2012, the author and colleagues surveyed eight publishers that had been involved with the Publishing and the Ecology of European Research (PEER) project to learn about the state of hybrid journal publishing. At the same time, one of the key questions asked to a panel of librarians at the International Association of Scientific, Technical &amp;amp; Medical Publishers May 2012 Meeting was what role librarians would play if scholarly publishing shortly went open access (OA) across the board? From the survey of the market, and the rapid OA developments in the UK and EU that include hybrid OA, a picture has begun to emerge of what roles librarians can play with regard to supporting hybrid OA publishing at their institutions. This article focuses on developing new partnerships within a given institution, looks at new budgetary models and the tracking of local scholarship creation.

In 2012, Simon Inger and Tracy Gardner undertook a large-scale international survey of journal readers, which followed on from smaller surveys undertaken in 2005 and 2008. The survey benefited from over 19,000 responses from across the world, with over 25% of the responses coming from each of North America, Europe and Asia, half the responses coming from the academic sector, but with still many thousands of responses making up smaller demographics.

Librarians must justify all expenditure, but quantitative metrical analysis to assess the value to the institution of journals and specialized research databases for AHSS subjects can be inconclusive; often the number of recorded transactions is lower than for STM, as the resource may be relevant to a smaller number of users. This paper draws on a literature review and extensive primary research, including a survey of 570 librarians and academics across the Anglophone countries, findings from focus group meetings and the analysis of user behaviour at a UK university before and after the installation of the Summon discovery system. It concludes that providing a new approach to metrics can help to develop resources strategies that meet changing user needs; and that usage statistics can be complemented with supplementary ROI measures to make them more meaningful.</description>            <dc:creator>Linda Bennett</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Zoe Loveland</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-07-08</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-07-08</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.84\">        <title>Simplifying the search experience \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd resisting the lure of shiny new technology</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.84</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;After two years of implementing a resource discovery system at the National University of Ireland, Galway (NUI Galway), and a new website to complement it, imagine our horror when in the first user survey postlaunch, our users told us that we were not meeting even their minimum expectations of a library website that allowed them to find information on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comment analysis, focus groups and a user observation study revealed that our technology-driven and information literacy-led implementation of our discovery system had resulted in user confusion.

This article explores the potentially disruptive financial effects of hybrid OA, especially for research-intensive universities. Starting from the assumption that OA will lead to higher costs of dissemination for higher education (HE) anyway, the author indicates two possible ways to get round the financials cliffs between toll access and open access. In both cases, it is necessary to construct a financial communication channel between costs of subscriptions and costs of article processing charges (APCs) on the level of the individual university and/or the consortium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Nol (Arnold) Verhagen</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.88\">        <title>People</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.88</link>                <dc:creator>John Jardine</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.77\">        <title>Key Issue - The \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFinch Report\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: the future is gold, but many challenges lie ahead</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.77</link>                <dc:creator>Albert Prior</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.44\">        <title>Opening access to African scholarly content: Stellenbosch University&#039;s AOARI platforms</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.44</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Africa is viewed as a consumer of the world&#039;s knowledge production.

The UK has been a leader in the global movement toward open access (OA) to research but recently its leadership has been derailed by the joint influence of the publishing industry lobby from without and well-intentioned but premature and unhelpful over-reaching from within the OA movement itself. The result has been the extremely counterproductive \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFinch Report\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd followed by a new draft of the Research Councils UK (RCUK) OA mandate, downgrading the role of cost-free OA self-archiving of research publications (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgreen OA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) in favor of paying subscription publishers over and above subscriptions, out of scarce research funds, in exchange for making single articles OA (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhybrid gold OA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). The motivation of the new policy is to reform publication and to gain certain re-use rights (CC-BY), but the likely effect would be researcher resistance, very little OA and a waste of research funds. There is still time to fix the RCUK mandate and restore the UK&#039;s leadership by taking a few very specific steps to clarify and strengthen the green component by adding a mechanism for monitoring and verifying compliance, with consequences for non-compliance, along lines also being adopted in the EC and the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Stevan Harnad</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.66\">        <title>The Arizona Universities Library Consortium patron-driven e-book model</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.66</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Building on Arizona State University&#039;s patron-driven acquisitions (PDA) initiative in 2009, the Arizona Universities Library Consortium, in partnership with the Ingram Content Group, created a cooperative patron-driven model to acquire electronic books (e-books). The model provides the opportunity for faculty and students at the universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents (ABOR) to access a core of e-books made accessible through resource discovery services and online catalogs. These books are available for significantly less than a single ABOR university would expend for the same materials. The patron-driven model described is one of many evolving models in digital scholarship, and, although the Arizona Universities Library Consortium reports a successful experience, patron-driven models pose questions to stakeholders in the academic publishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Jeanne Richardson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.82\">        <title>A day in the life of &lt;i&gt;a consortium manager&lt;/i&gt; </title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.82</link>                <dc:creator>Jayhoon Kim</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.5\">        <title>Introducing our Publications and Editorial Board</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.5</link>                <dc:creator>Ally Souster</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-03-01</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-03-01</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.34\">        <title>Co-operation and collaboration to strengthen the global research cycle</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.26.1.34</link>            <description>This article provides an update on the International Network for the Availability of Scientific Publications (INASP), a development charity working in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

This article looks at the potentially profound consequences of these steps for publishers, librarians and researchers in the UK, and for scholarly communications in general, not least for the centuries-old model of peer review.

The software is mostly released under an Open Source licence and the re-use of existing tools and services is often the most effective way for institutions looking to set up an e-publishing system. But information on e-publishing tools and services is often hard to get or tends not to get passed on.

From the legal perspective, the policy grants to the University a license to archive all peer-reviewed scholarly articles in the DukeSpace repository, which is managed by the University Libraries. That license is broad, but there were clear limitations on its implementation expressed by the Academic Council. From the point of view of values, this policy is a clear statement that research is undertaken for the benefit of society as a whole, and that improving access to the products of that research is beneficial to the researchers themselves, to the University and to the global community.

Surplus copies can be removed without endangering the scholarly record. But identifying candidates for deselection is time-consuming. Batch-oriented tools that incorporate both archival and service values are needed.

The project involved soliciting detailed information from each of the providers of the major products in this genre, reviewing product information available on the web and in published articles, and conducting a survey addressed to libraries using these products. The report identified and presented comparative information on a top tier of products that includes KnowledgeWorks and 360 Link from Serials Solutions; SFX Global KnowledgeBase and the SFX link resolver from Ex Libris; LinkSource and the EBSCO Integrated Knowledge Base from EBSCO and the WorldCat knowledge base from OCLC. A second tier included TOUResolver from TDNet, Gold Rush from the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries and GODOT from Simon Fraser University. Innovative Interfaces, Inc offers the WebBridge link resolver but does not produce a knowledge base. The library survey revealed relatively narrow differences in the statistical results. Serial Solutions emerged as more favorable in most categories except for end-user functionality where Ex Libris received higher ratings. The Global Open Knowledgebase project (GOKb) is noteworthy as a nascent community-based effort to produce a knowledge base. Key trends noted include less emphasis on knowledge bases and link resolvers as stand-alone products as they become integral components of comprehensive discovery and automation products.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Marshall Breeding</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-07-05</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-07-05</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.2.216\">        <title>A day in the life of &lt;i&gt;a freelance publisher&lt;/i&gt; </title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.2.216</link>                <dc:creator>Emma Anderson</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-07-05</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-07-05</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.2.219\">        <title>People</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.2.219</link>                <dc:creator>John Jardine</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-07-05</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-07-05</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.2.130\">        <title>Scholarly Reading and the Value of Academic Library Collections: results of a study in six UK universities</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.2.130</link>            <description>Measuring the use, outcomes and value of the library\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds role in scholarly reading helps demonstrate the value library collections bring to scholarship.

There is a growing degree of anger, especially from early-career academics in a time of austerity, at perceived publisher extortion. The current models of open access do not address all these problems, especially with regard to library budgets. While some of this anger is misplaced, publishers must either self-discipline their practices or find themselves displaced by alternate models. Libraries, likewise, face a dangerous time in which the threat of third-party tender for their services brings extinction ever closer.

Affordable pricing and flexible terms and conditions of use, enabling content to be used to support teaching, learning and research, are central to negotiations. In 2011, JISC Collections launched JISC eCollections (&lt;a href=&quot;/editor/viewMetadata/www.jiscecollections.ac.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.jiscecollections.ac.uk&lt;/a&gt;), a community-owned content service developed to protect and preserve existing content investments by offering an alternative to commercial providers. It brings access fees within the control of the community, in terms of ring-fenced reinvestment and moderation of increases. A completely new venture for JISC Collections, the rationale behind the service&#039;s development and some of the challenges overcome in creating three new content platforms are presented in this case study. These included discovering and addressing gaps in content, rationalizing metadata, bringing lots of licences together under one model, anticipating and meeting the needs of multiple audiences (but delivering a simple overall interface) and developing an appropriate business model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Caren Milloy</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.66\">        <title>Building cross-border communities to energize learning, teaching and innovation in higher education</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.66</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;As universities worldwide take an increasingly interdisciplinary approach to higher education, effective communication must bridge the gap across fields of study as well as across linguistic, cultural and professional boundaries.

Coupled with digital technologies that can help teams generate connections and collaborations, these data sets can support large-scale innovation and insight. However, by looking at a comparable explosion in data-driven journalism, this article hopes to highlight some of the ethical questions that may arise from big data. The popularity of the social networking service Twitter to share information during the riots in London in August 2011 produced a real-time record of sense-making of enormous interest to academics, reporters and to Twitter users themselves; however, when analysed and published, academic and journalistic interpretations of aggregate content was transformed and individualized, with potential implications for a user-base that was unaware it was being observed. Similar issues arise in academic research with human subjects. Here, the questions of reflexivity in data design and research ethics are considered through a popular media frame.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Aleksandra K Krotoski</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.4\">        <title>Introducing our Editorial Board</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.4</link>                <dc:creator>Nick Woolley</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.61\">        <title>Scenarios for the future of scholarly communications</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.61</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;How might scholarly communication change in the future, given the shifting landscape and impact of technology and what would this mean for publishers and libraries?

The academic research library must sustain its core responsibilities, albeit in an increasingly digitized, networked and mobile condition, enrich fundamental relationships with its user communities, and assume powerful new roles in support of learning and scholarship. New measures of quality, impact, productivity, innovation and leadership must be advanced. The paper suggests that the evolution of the academic library will focus more on an evolving period of polygamy, parabiosis and particularism, as we think beyond the transition to electronic and more about a post-digital context.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>James G Neal</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.1\">        <title>Editorial</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.1</link>                <dc:creator>L Lorraine</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>S Steve</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.98\">        <title>Ten things to consider when entering into public-private digitization partnerships</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.98</link>            <description> &lt;p&gt;Over the past three years the British Library has brokered mass digitization partnerships with Google, Brightsolid, Find my Past, Cengage Learning and others.

It also covers topics like term (length of time), the importance of flexibility, maximizing use/re-use of digitized material and market penetration. Legal and other aspects of such partnerships are also detailed, with sections on the type of partnership that needs to be entered into (non-exclusive) and the role of the commercial partner. Finally, there is sound advice about risk assessment and cover.

This paper explores case studies of different shared services models, the lessons learned, the success factors and provides some tips on implementation. It also proposes a practical model to assess whether a shared services option is likely to deliver the objectives being sought and, if so, which is likely to be the best model. Finally, it points out that shared services can be cross sectoral and asks whether some higher and further educational institutions could find a business opportunity through taking over the running of local authority library services.</description>            <dc:creator>Colin M Cram</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.44\">        <title>An evidence-based approach to engaging healthcare users in a journal review project</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.44</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to significant cutbacks in the Irish health service, the Adelaide and Meath Hospital incorporating the National Children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Hospital (AMNCH) Library\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds budget was reduced by 25% in 2011, necessitating the cancellation of journals.

The discussion is informed by evidence from the University of Liverpool COUNTER usage statistics and includes modelling of the costs that might result from observed usage patterns if a PDA purchasing model were applied. Criteria for evaluating the success of e-book packages are discussed, including a consideration of how value for money can be calculated for different e-book purchasing models. An outline is provided of the implications for managing acquisitions budgets when e-book collections form part of the acquisitions strategy.</description>            <dc:creator>Terry Bucknell</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.103\">        <title>Key Issue</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.103</link>            <description>A few months ago, while I was participating in a conference about open access infrastructures, a delegate from a governmental agency asked, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWhy does each library need to maintain a repository for their own scientists?\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd He was rightfully wondering if a broad collaboration in building a network of archives will provide a durable and extensible technology and service framework for ever-increasing digital scholarly content. The ensuing discussion did not offer a plausible response but accentuated that we do not have in place a plan for building an expandable infrastructure to facilitate communication and exchange of information among rapidly proliferating distinct instances of institutional and subject repositories.</description>            <dc:creator>Oya Y Rieger</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.8\">        <title>Profile - Sarah Thomas</title>    <link>http://insights.uksg.org/article/view/2048-7754.25.1.8</link>                    <dc:date>2012-03-07</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2012-03-07</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>28</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>  </item>  </rdf:RDF> ",
