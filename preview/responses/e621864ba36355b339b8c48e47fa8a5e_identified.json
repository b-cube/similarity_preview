The DEM is formatted as one ASCII                 header record (A-record), followed by a series of profile                 records (B-records) each of which include a short B-record                 header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each                 profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy                 record (C-record). The 7.5-minute DEM (10- by 10-m data spacing,                 elevations in decimeters) is cast on the Universal Transverse                 Mercator (UTM) projection (the quads UTM zone can be found in                 the header record (Record A)) in the North American Datum of                 1927. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each                 product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute                 quadrangle, but overedges are published as separate DEM files.                 Coverage is available for all quads completely contained within                 New York State, plus some additional ones falling along the                 borders and containing significant area of the State's land.</abstract>             <purpose>DEMs can be used as source data for digital orthophotos and                 as layers in geographic information systems for earth science                 analysis. DEMs can also serve as tools for volumetric analysis,                 for site location of towers, or for drainage basin delineation.                 These data are collected as part of the National Mapping                 Program.</purpose>             <supplinf>7.5-minute DEMs have rows and columns which vary in length                 and are staggered. The UTM bounding coordinates form a                 quadrilateral (no two sides are parallel to each other), rather                 than a rectangle. The user will need to pad out the uneven rows                 and columns with blanks or flagged data values, if a rectangle                 is required for the user's application. Some software vendors                 have incorporated this function into their software for input of                 standard formatted USGS DEMs.</supplinf>         </descript>         <timeperd>             <timeinfo>                 <sngdate>                     <caldate>unknown</caldate>                 </sngdate>             </timeinfo>             <current>ground condition</current>         </timeperd>         <status>             <progress>Complete</progress>             <update>Irregular</update>         </status>         <spdom>             <bounding>                 <westbc>-79.77</westbc>                 <eastbc>-71.85</eastbc>                 <northbc>45.02</northbc>                 <southbc>40.49</southbc>             </bounding>         </spdom>         <keywords>             <theme>                 <themekt>None</themekt>                 <themekey>digital elevation model</themekey>                 <themekey>digital terrain model</themekey>                 <themekey>hypsography</themekey>                 <themekey>altitude</themekey>                 <themekey>height</themekey>                 <themekey>landforms</themekey>                 <themekey>relief</themekey>                 <themekey>topography</themekey>                 <themekey>raster</themekey>                 <themekey>grid</themekey>                 <themekey>cell</themekey>             </theme>             <theme>                 <themekt>Library of Congress Subject Headings</themekt>                 <themekey>Hydrography</themekey>                 <themekey>Digital Mapping</themekey>                 <themekey>Digital mapping -- Automation</themekey>                 <themekey>Cartography -- Automation</themekey>                 <themekey>New York (State) -- Dept. of Environmental                     Conservation</themekey>             </theme>             <theme>                 <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>                 <themekey>elevation</themekey>                 <themekey>006</themekey>             </theme>             <place>                 <placekt>Department of Commerce, 1987, Codes for the                     Identification of the States, The District of Columbia and                     the Outlying Areas of the U.S., and Associated Areas                     (Federal Information Processing Standard 5-2): Washington,                     Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and                     Technology (http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip5-2.htm)</placekt>                 <placekey>New York</placekey>                 <placekey>36</placekey>                 <placekey>NY</placekey>             </place>             <place>                 <placekt>Library of Congress Subject Headings</placekt>                 <placekey>New York (State)</placekey>             </place>             <place>                 <placekt>Geographic Names Information System                     http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic</placekt>                 <placekey>New York State</placekey>             </place>         </keywords>         <accconst>None</accconst>         <useconst>1.

Raster data converted to             vector with line-center algorithm in LT4X v. 3.1, 11/11/93, by John             Dabritz of Infotec Development Inc. Grid elevations calculated with             8-profile weighted linear interpolation, with cubic smoothing of             slope at the contour line as per algorithm in above mentioned LT4X             v. - export in DEM format, UTM meters, - grid height and width of 10             mt, - clipping (overedge) coordinate in UTM mt, - input coord feet             or meters (depending on source material), output in             meters/decimeters, - DEM grid points which are on a profile section             longer than 80 mt are smoothed by passing the grid through a low             pass-filter twice. The filter size (see below) is of 9 cell             diameters (aprox 9 mt). The purpose here is to leave well-contoured             areas untouched while smoothing areas of less than 5-2.5% slope (to             lessen streaking in flat areas typical of multiple-profile DEM             derivation). - cubic smoothing of elevation profile across contours             to 35% of the distance between adjacent contours. These profiles             have a smaller, but still discontinuous change in slope at contour             intersection than if not rounded. - 9 cell diameter for smoothing             reach, - use all 8 directions (from grid point to N, S, E, W ,NE,             NW, SE, SW) for each cell, - no line feeds. export dem             &lt;contour data name&gt; 2 10.00 10.00 2 1 4 80 2 0.35 9 8             0</native>         <crossref>             <citeinfo>                 <origin>US Geological Survey</origin>                 <pubdate>unknown</pubdate>                 <title>Digital Elevation Model (DEM)</title>                 <onlink>http://eros.usgs.gov/guides/dem.html</onlink>             </citeinfo>         </crossref>     </idinfo>      <dataqual>         <attracc>             <attraccr>10 mt gridding cell spacing is the maximun that can be                 meaningfully extracted from hypsography contour lines.

A. Original Data Source                     Preparation: 1. The United States Geological Service (USGS)                     office of Map Production (Mid Continent Mapping Center,                     Rolla, MO) selects the most recent original printing plates                     (1:24,000 or 1:25,000 scale) for each published quadrangle                     map. These plates are archived under controlled                     environmental conditions and are produced from the original                     map scripting materials onto dimensionally stable material                     (Mylar). A copy of the separate is made by contact methods                     onto photosensitive, opaque, dimensionally stable material.                     The separate plate copy is shipped to the USGS Mapping                     Applications Center (Reston, VA). 2. The MAC scans the                     separate plate with an Ektaprint (a.k.a. Optronics) drum                     scanner with an aperture of 24um (corresponding to a linear                     resolution of approx 1030 DPI) into a run-length encoded                     (RLE) formatted raster file. Contours lines have typically a                     thickness of 25 to 30 pixels. The file, typically between 10                     and 20 Mb, would be checked for completeness and distortion.                     If satisfactory MAC forwards both the raster file, the plate                     separate and the corresponding published quadrangle to the                     digitization workshop at the New York State Department of                     Environmental Conservation Water GIS unit in Albany, NY. B.                     Raster file batch processing 1. The raster file was loaded                     into Line Tracer for X Windows (LT4X, Infotec Inc.,                     Portland, Oregon) version 3.1. With it is georegistered and                     trimmed of any excess margin. 2. The file is put through an                     automated raster-to-vector batch process in which a vector                     following the center of the raster line is created, with a                     minimum vertex separation of 25 pixels. Once the vector has                     been calculated and the topology of the resultant data                     established, the resolution of the original raster was                     reduced to 500 DPI, to allow faster processing in the                     succeeding steps. C. Vector Contour Edit, Edge Matching and                     Labeling. 1. The vectorized contours are edited carefully to                     correct any line breaks, vector webbing (due to pen                     thickness or lack of resolution of the original's drafting                     process), labels and special line symbols (depressions, road                     fills, etc). 2. The contours are labeled with their                     corresponding elevations, as tagged in the original                     material. 3. The eight adjoining maps' vector contours are                     brought in and checked against those of the map being                     edited. Vectors of matching labels are snapped together if                     the gap is less than 3 line-thicknesses. Otherwise they are                     tagged as \"disagreement in the original\" (see DLG standards                     for hypsography layer). For each border only one of the maps                     is edited. 4. An independent quality control check of                     contour edits and labeling is carried out. 5. The Digital                     Elevation Model is interpolated in a batch process (see                     \"Native Dataset Environment\" above). D. DEM Edit and Quality                     Control 1. The resultant DEM is loaded in Delta3D (Infotec                     Inc., Portland, OR) v. 2.1, together with the corresponding                     hydrography vectors. The DEM is checked for the presence of                     irregular patterns, in which case it is returned to the                     previous process; water body height (e.g. in large lakes) is                     set for all grid cells within the water body; and drainage                     along vector streams is enforced by lowering cells higher                     than the upstream one along the stream. Water retention                     areas (wetlands, marshes...) are not modified except for                     stream entrance and exit. - Edge matching with the adjoining                     eight DEMs. 2. From thirty to thirty-five height reference                     markers are collected from the corresponding cultural                     separate for the quadrangle. These are compared to heights                     as read from the DEM and an statistical RMS is calculated,                     this is recorded in the DEM's C record. 3. The quadrangle                     record A is filled and checked for consistency. 4. A final                     DEM-formatted elevation dataset for the quadrangle is                     recorded. E. Final Quality Control and Databasing 1. The DEM                     file is shipped to USGS's Rocky Mountain Mapping Center                     (Boulder, CO). There it undergoes a separate quality control                     process which essentially mimics D. 2. The corresponding                     quality control flags are established. The DEM is                     sub-sampled to 30 mt grid spacing and the resultant file is                     forwarded to USGS's EROS Data Center, were it is catalogued                     into the National Elevation database. The 10 mt grid spacing                     file is returned to NYS DEC, from where it is forwarded to                     Cornell University's Mann Library.</procdesc>                 <procdate>Unknown</procdate>             </procstep>         </lineage>     </dataqual>      <spref>         <horizsys>             <planar>                 <gridsys>                     <gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn>                     <utm>                         <utmzone>17 or 18 or 19</utmzone>                         <transmer>                             <sfctrmer>.9996</sfctrmer>                             <longcm>+075.000000</longcm>                             <latprjo>+00.000000</latprjo>                             <feast>0</feast>                             <fnorth>0</fnorth>                         </transmer>                     </utm>                 </gridsys>                 <planci>                     <plance>row and column</plance>                     <coordrep>                         <absres>10</absres>                         <ordres>10</ordres>                     </coordrep>                     <plandu>Meters</plandu>                 </planci>             </planar>             <geodetic>                 <horizdn>North American Datum of 1927</horizdn>                 <ellips>Clarke 1866</ellips>                 <semiaxis>6378206.4</semiaxis>                 <denflat>294.9787</denflat>             </geodetic>         </horizsys>         <vertdef>             <altsys>                 <altdatum>National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929</altdatum>                 <altres>1</altres>                 <altunits>decimeters</altunits>                 <altenc>Explicit elevation coordinate included with horizontal                     coordinates</altenc>             </altsys>         </vertdef>     </spref>      <eainfo>         <overview>             <eaover>The digital elevation model is composed of an elevation                 value linked to a grid cell location representing a gridded form                 of a topographic map hypsography overlay.
