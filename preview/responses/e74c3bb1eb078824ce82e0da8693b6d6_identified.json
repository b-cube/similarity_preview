The data were constructed from the United States Marshals Service (USMS) Prisoner Tracking System database. Records include arrests made by federal law enforcement agencies (including the USMS), state and local agencies, and self-surrenders. Offenders arrested for federal offenses are transferred to the custody of the USMS for processing, transportation, and detention. The Prisoner Tracking System contains data on all offenders within the custody of the USMS. The data file contains variables from the original USMS files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 1.1-1.3. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2007-10-01\" cycle=\"P1\">2007-10-01</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2008-09-30\" cycle=\"P1\">2008-09-30</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2007-10-01\" cycle=\"P1\">2007-10-01</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2008-09-30\" cycle=\"P1\">2008-09-30</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>federal prisoners</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Federal offenders in the custody of the United States Marshals Service during fiscal year 2008.</universe>                      <dataKind>event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          extracts from the USMS Prisoner Tracking System file             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.

Accordingly, any intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment may violate federal law as well as the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information. Therefore, users of data collected by or with the support from the U.S. Department of Justice and distributed by NACJD or other ICPSR archives must agree to abide by these regulations and understand that ICPSR may report any potential violation to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>                                    <p>AVAILABLE.
