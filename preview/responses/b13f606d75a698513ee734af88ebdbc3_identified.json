Actually knowledge grows when shared and the free online access to peer-reviewed scientific publications is a potent ingredient the process of sharing. The sharing of knowledge is facilitated by the Open Access Movement. However Open Access is much more than downloading the PDF. Vice President of the European Commission and European Digital Agenda Commissioner Neelie Kroes boldly presented this message in the Opening Session of the OpenAIRE launch. On the 2nd December 2010 the official launch of OpenAIRE the European infrastructure for Open Access was launched in Ghent, Belgium. This project and initiative is facilitating the success of the Open Access Pilot in FP7 as presented earlier in this journal. In this brief article I will present some of the most interesting issues that were discussed during the first session of the day.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/246686</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:10</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:11Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>PloS one: 6 (2011) no. 2, pp. 16460</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Poletti, Piero</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Ajelli, Marco</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Merler, Stefano</dc:creator>   <dc:title>The Effect of Risk Perception on the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Dynamics</dc:title>   <dc:date>2011-02-01</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/10</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0016460</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>Background: The 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza dynamics in Italy was characterized by a notable pattern: as it emerged from the analysis of influenza-like illness data, after an initial period (September\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmid-October 2009) characterized by a slow exponential increase in the weekly incidence, a sudden and sharp increase of the growth rate was observed by mid- October. The aim here is to understand whether spontaneous behavioral changes in the population could be responsible for such a pattern of epidemic spread. Methodology/Principal Findings: In order to face this issue, a mathematical model of influenza transmission, accounting for spontaneous behavioral changes driven by cost/benefit considerations on the perceived risk of infection, is proposed and validated against empirical epidemiological data. The performed investigation revealed that an initial overestimation of the risk of infection in the general population, possibly induced by the high concern for the emergence of a new influenza pandemic, results in a pattern of spread compliant with the observed one. This finding is also supported by the analysis of antiviral drugs purchase over the epidemic period. Moreover, by assuming a generation time of 2.5 days, the initially diffuse misperception of the risk of infection led to a relatively low value of the reproductive number 1:24, which increased to 1:48 in the subsequent phase of the pandemic. Conclusions/Significance: This study highlights that spontaneous behavioral changes in the population, not accounted by the large majority of influenza transmission models, can not be neglected to correctly inform public health decisions. In fact, individual choices can drastically affect the epidemic spread, by altering timing, dynamics and overall number of cases.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/201601</dc:relation>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/231807</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:19</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:11Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>EURASIP Journal on Advances in Signal Processing: 2010 (2010) pp. 10</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Hendeby, Gustaf</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Karlsson, Rickard</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Gustafsson, Fredrik</dc:creator>   <dc:title>The Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter: A Filter Bank Implementation</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-11-25</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/19</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1155/2010/724087</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>For computational efficiency, it is important to utilize model structure in particle filtering. One of the most important cases occurs when there exists a linear Gaussian substructure, which can be efficiently handled by Kalman filters. This is the standard formulation of the Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF). This contribution suggests an alternative formulation of this wellknown result that facilitates reuse of standard filtering components and which is also suitable for object-oriented programming. Our RBPF formulation can be seen as a Kalman filter bank with stochastic branching and pruning.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/248290</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/closedAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:23</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:12Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Studies in Health Technology and Informatics: 154 (2010) pp. 20-25</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>RIVA, Giuseppe</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Interreality in the Management of Psychological Stress: a Clinical Scenario</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-07-01</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/23</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.3233/978-1-60750-561-7-20</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>The term \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpsychological stress\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd describes a situation in which a subject perceives that environmental demands tax or exceed his or her adaptive capacity.

Data on social contact patterns are, however, expensive to obtain. A major issue is then whether the simulation of synthetic societies might be helpful to reliably reconstruct such data. In this paper, we compute a variety of synthetic age-specific contact matrices through simulation of a simple individual-based model (IBM). The model is informed by Italian Time Use data and routine socio-demographic data (e.g., school and workplace attendance, household structure, etc.). The model is named \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLittle Italy\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd because each artificial agent is a clone of a real person. In other words, each agent's daily diary is the one observed in a corresponding real individual sampled in the Italian Time Use Survey. We also generated contact matrices from the socio-demographic model underlying the Italian IBM for pandemic prediction. These synthetic matrices are then validated against recently collected Italian serological data for Varicella (VZV) and ParvoVirus (B19). Their performance in fitting sero-profiles are compared with other matrices available for Italy, such as the Polymod matrix. Synthetic matrices show the same qualitative features of the ones estimated from sample surveys: for example, strong assortativeness and the presence of super- and sub-diagonal stripes related to contacts between parents and children. Once validated against serological data, Little Italy matrices fit worse than the Polymod one for VZV, but better than concurrent matrices for B19. This is the first occasion where synthetic contact matrices are systematically compared with real ones, and validated against epidemiological data. The results suggest that simple, carefully designed, synthetic matrices can provide a fruitful complementary approach to questionnaire-based matrices. The paper also supports the idea that, depending on the transmissibility level of the infection, either the number of different contacts, or repeated exposure, may be the key factor for transmission.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/201601</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:774</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:14Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>Proceedings of the Royal society of biological sciences: 278 (2011) no. 1719, pp. 2753-2760</dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>House, Thomas</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Baguelin, Marc</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Van Hoek, Jan Albert</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>White, Peter J.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Sadique, Zia</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Eames, Ken</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Read, Jonathan M.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Hens, Niels</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Melegaro, Alessia</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Edmunds, John W.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Keeling, Matt J.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Modelling the impact of local reactive school closures on critical care provision during an influenza pandemic</dc:title>   <dc:date>2011-02-02</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/774</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1098/rspb.2010.2688</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>Despite the fact that the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza strain was less severe than had been feared, both seasonal epidemics of influenza-like-illness and future influenza pandemics have the potential to place a serious burden on health services. The closure of schools has been postulated as a means of reducing transmission between children and hence reducing the number of cases at the peak of an epidemic; this is supported by the marked reduction in cases during school holidays observed across the world during the 2009 pandemic. However, a national policy of long-duration school closures could have severe economic costs. Reactive short-duration closure of schools in regions where health services are close to capacity offers a potential compromise, but it is unclear over what spatial scale and time frame closures would need to be made to be effective. Here, using detailed geographical information for England, we assess how localized school closures could alleviate the burden on hospital intensive care units (ICUs) that are reaching capacity. We show that, for a range of epidemiologically plausible assumptions, considerable local coordination of school closures is needed to achieve a substantial reduction in the number of hospitals where capacity is exceeded at the peak of the epidemic. The heterogeneity in demand per hospital ICU bed means that even widespread school closures are unlikely to have an impact on whether demand will exceed capacity for many hospitals. These results support the UK decision not to use localized school closures as a control mechanism, but have far wider international public-health implications. The spatial heterogeneities in both population density and hospital capacity that give rise to our results exist in many developed countries, while our model assumptions are sufficiently general to cover a wide range of pathogens. This leads us to believe that when a pandemic has severe implications for ICU capacity, only widespread school closures (with their associated costs and organizational challenges) are sufficient to mitigate the burden on the worst-affected hospitals.</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/201601</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:openaire.cern.ch:778</identifier><datestamp>2014-03-10T17:35:14Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>BMC infectious diseases: 10 (2010) </dc:source>   <dc:language>eng</dc:language>   <dc:creator>Melegaro, Alessia</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Choi, Yoon Hong</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>George, Robert</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Edmunds, John W.</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Miller, Elizabeth</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Gay, Nigel J.</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Dynamic models of pneumococcal carriage and the impact of the Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-04-08</dc:date>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/778</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1186/1471-2334-10-90</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been introduced in national immunisation programmes of most industrialised countries and recently in two African GAVI eligible countries (Rwanda and The Gambia).
