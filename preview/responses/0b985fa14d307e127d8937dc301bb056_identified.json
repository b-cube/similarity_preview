As you know, in 2013 we began the process of examining systems from statewide vendors, released an RFP in 2014, and reviewed those who submitted. We have landed on this system--which will serve K-Adult learners--providing top-notch career development to Oklahomans. And, we are able to provide it at no cost to your school.   This system is currently being built specifically for Oklahoma. Many of the same features--assessments, resume builder, administrative tools, and more--in a new and improved format. The OK Career Guide system will serve a wider audience and provide more data to administrators, among other upgrades.    Instructors will have the opportunity to attend trainings in your area; there will also be a wide variety of other tools available to help you learn the new system such as webinars, tool kits, quick start guides, etc. Watch for transition announcements and training opportunities as we move closer to the launch date!
