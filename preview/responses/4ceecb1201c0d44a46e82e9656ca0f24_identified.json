These analyses are based on quality-controlled station observations. &lt;b>Conclusions:&lt;/b>* Summer rains have decreased in eastern Chad during the past 20 years.  * Temperatures have increased by 0.8 &amp;deg;Celsius since 1975, amplifying the effect of droughts. * Crop yields are very low and stagnant. * The amount of farmland per person is low, and decliningrapidly.* Population growth combined with stagnating yieldscould lead to a 30 percent reduction in per capita cereal production by 2025.* In many cases, areas with changing climate are coincident with zones of substantial conflict, indicating some degree of association; however, the contribution of climate change to these conflicts is not currently understood.</abstract><physicalDescription><form>4 p.</form><form>U.S. Geological Survey</form><form>Reston, VA</form></physicalDescription><location><url note=\"THUMBNAIL\">http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/thumbnails/fs_2012_3070.JPG</url><url displayLabel=\"html\" note=\"INDEX PAGE\">http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2012/3070/</url></location><note type=\"citation/reference\">A climate trend analysis of Chad; 2012; FS; 2012-3070; Fact Sheet; Funk, Chris; Rowland, Jim; Adoum, Alkhalil; Eilerts, Gary; White, Libby</note><languageTerm>English</languageTerm><relatedItem type=\"original\"><titleInfo><title>Fact Sheet</title></titleInfo></relatedItem></mods></modsCollection>",
