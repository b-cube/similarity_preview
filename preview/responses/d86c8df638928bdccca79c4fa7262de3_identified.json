This is the critical first step towards the formation of the notorious locust swarms.</p> <p>Dr Ott said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLocusts only have a small number of nerve cells that can synthesise serotonin. \\ufffd\\ufffdNow we have found that of these, a very select few respond specifically when a locust is first forced to be with other locusts. Within an hour, they produce more serotonin.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIt is these few cells that we think are responsible for the transformation of a loner into a gang member. In the long run, however, many of the other serotonin-cells also change, albeit towards making less serotonin.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Serotonin has important roles in the brains of all animals that include the regulation of moods and social interactions.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>In humans, there are strong links between changes in serotonin and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.</p> <p>The paper, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd<i>Differential activation of serotonergic neurons during short- and long-term gregarization of desert locusts\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd,</i> published in the academic journal <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</i>,<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1800/20142062\"> can be found here</a>.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2014/december/bugs-life-the-nerve-cells-that-make-locusts-2018gang-up2019\" class=\"external-link\">Press Release </a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-17T12:50:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/july/banana-genome-sequence-unzipped\">     <title>Banana genome sequence unzipped</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/july/banana-genome-sequence-unzipped</link>     <description>Leicester botanist contributes to important breakthrough with far-reaching consequences.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Last week the banana became the latest organism to have its entire genome sequenced, with the help of a Leicester academic.
