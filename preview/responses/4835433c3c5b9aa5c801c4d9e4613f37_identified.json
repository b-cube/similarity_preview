This large storm brought high winds (gusts of up to 85 mph) to the entire region and a storm surge of approximately 3 to 4 meters to parts of Norton Sound. The storm caused extensive flooding in the lower portion of Golovin on the afternoon of November 9, 2011. A team of Alaska Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) scientists visited Golovin on November 15, 2011, to document peak water levels, runup elevations, and inundation extents caused by this event. These data were combined with photographs taken by local residents during the event and elevation data from the 2004 DCCED Community Map to generate inundation limit lines.</abstract>       <purpose>The purpose of this shapefile is to show the extent of the November 9, 2011 flooding in Golovin, AK.</purpose>       <supplinf>The primary file of this data distribution package is a shapefile which shows the extent of the November 9, 2011 flooding in Golovin, AK.

these included the measurement of debris lines, water and slush limits in the snow, and elevations of visibly overtopped or inundated areas. Each measured flood indicator was assigned a qualitative confidence level to reflect the validity of inferring marine flood levels from the measurement. High confidence was applied to locations where evidence of a discrete water level was readily observed in the field (slush lines, for example). Medium confidence was applied to points that were measured at the best approximation of the water position based on partially obscured or indiscrete evidence (tension cracks in snow or many of the photo-identified points, for example). Lowest confidence was applied to points where the role of floodwater in the creation of a flood indicator was ambiguous, where locations were identified solely from the memories of residents, or where clean-up activities had modified the site enough to conceal the exact location of the flood extent. The elevation of the measured flood indicators as well as associated confidence levels are outlined in a table on Sheet 1 of the accompanying report.</attraccr>     </attracc>     <logic>not applicable</logic>     <complete>Due to the morphology of the Golovin coastline, which shelters the community from direct wave attack, the paucity of runup limit indicators and the short amount of time available in the field, the flood inundation limit line does not extend to the exposed (Golovin Bay) side of the community. However, reported accounts from several residents indicated that a protective band of slush helped to reduce the wave energy on the southern side of the community. Our observations supported these accounts because there was no evidence of waves overtopping the crest of the ice ridge along the Golovin Bay coast, except at the very southwestern tip of the peninsula near the old airport. For more information about the location and elevation of the measured flood indicators used to produce this inundation limit line see map sheet 1 of the accompanying report.</complete>     <posacc>       <horizpa>         <horizpar>The inundation limit line has a horizontal positional accuracy dependent on: 1) The error associated with the 32 field measurements of flood indicators. Measurements were obtained using a Topcon survey grade GPS, horizontal precision values were calculated using Topcon office software to be less than 10 cm. 2) The error associated with the position and elevation of contours on the DCCED community map. The DCCED map accuracy is reported as meeting National Cartographic Mapping Standards (90% of defined horizontal points are accurate to within 2 feet, 90% of elevations are accurate to within 1 foot).</horizpar>       </horizpa>     </posacc>     <lineage>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development</origin>             <origin>Kawarak-Incorporated</origin>             <pubdate>2004</pubdate>             <title>Golovin Community Map, Sheet 1</title>             <geoform>map</geoform>             <onlink>http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/profiles/profile-maps.htm</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <typesrc>image</typesrc>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <sngdate>               <caldate>2004</caldate>             </sngdate>           </timeinfo>           <srccurr>publication date</srccurr>         </srctime>         <srccitea>Community Profile Map, Golovin, 2004</srccitea>         <srccontr>Provided elevation information and high resolution imagery.</srccontr>       </srcinfo>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Fieldwork - Investigations following the November 8th storm consisted of one day of fieldwork during which the DGGS team was able to measure 32 flood indicators and collect personal accounts, photos and video from residents.</procdesc>         <procdate>201211</procdate>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Digitization of flood extent - The position of the inundation limit lines were first determined using the flood indicators measured in the field and photographs taken by local residents during the event.
