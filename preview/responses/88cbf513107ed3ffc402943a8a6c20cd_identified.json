This count of every resident in the United States was mandated by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution and all households in the U.S. and individuals living in group quarters were required by law to respond to the 2010 Census questionnaire. The data collected by the decennial census determine the number of seats each state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and is also used to distribute billions in federal funds to local communities. The questionnaire consisted of a limited number of questions but allowed for the collection of information on the number of people in the household and their relationship to the householder, an individual's age, sex, race and Hispanic ethnicity, the number of housing units and whether those units are owner- or renter-occupied, or vacant. The first wave of results for sub-state geographic areas in New Mexico was released on March 15, 2011, through the Redistricting Data (PL94-171) Summary File. This batch of data covers the state, counties, places (both incorporated and unincorporated communities), tribal lands, school districts, neighborhoods (census tracts and block groups), individual census blocks, and other areas. The Redistricting products provide counts by race and Hispanic ethnicity for the total population and the population 18 years and over, and housing unit counts by occupancy status. The 2010 Census Redistricting Data Summary File can be used to redraw federal, state and local legislative districts under Public Law 94-171. This is an important purpose of the file and, indeed, state officials use the Redistricting Data to realign congressional and state legislative districts in their states, taking into account population shifts since the 2000 Census. More detailed population and housing characteristics will be released in the summer of 2011. The data in these particular RGIS Clearinghouse tables are for all Block Groups in Eddy County. There are two data tables. One provides total counts by major race groups and by Hispanic ethnicity, while the other provides proportions of the total population for these same groups. These files, along with file-specific descriptions (in Word and text formats) are available in a single zip file.</abstract>          <purpose>To provide data for the total population by major race groups and Hispanic ethnicity. This gives the data user a snapshot of racial and Hispanic ethnicity distributions for small geographic areas in Eddy County.</purpose>          <supplinf>These particular tables provide data for Eddy County as a whole and all block groups in the county. The table that is labeled DC10_00013 provides a count of the total population, the total number of persons who identified with one and only one racial group, and a distribution of persons who identified with only one racial group according to six categories: White alone; Black or African American alone; American Indian or Alaska Native alone; Asian alone; Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander alone; and Some Other Race alone. The \"alone\" designation refers to persons who selected only a single race on the 2010 Census questionnaire. In addition, the table provides the total number of persons who identified with two or more racial groups. The table also shows the counts of the total Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. The persons included in these Hispanic and non-Hispanic aggregates are of any race. Lastly, there is a count of non-Hispanic persons who indicated that they were White alone, i.e., not Hispanic White alone. The table that is labeled DC10_00046 provides a count of the total population, the percent of total persons who identified with one and only one racial group, and a percent distribution of total persons who identified with only one racial group according to the six categories listed above. In addition, the table provides the percent of total persons who identified with two or more racial groups. The table also shows the percent of total persons who are Hispanic and the percent that are non-Hispanic. Lastly, the table provides the percent of total persons who are non-Hispanic and who indicated that they were White alone, i.e., not Hispanic White alone.</supplinf>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>20100401</begdate>                <enddate>20100401</enddate>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current>These files were created with information from the first release of 2010 Census sub-state data, the Redistricting Data (PL94-171) Summary File.
