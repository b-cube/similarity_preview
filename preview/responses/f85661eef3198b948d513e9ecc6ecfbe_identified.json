Respondents were asked if they had favorable or unfavorable impressions of the Soviet Union, China, Japan, and West Germany, if they thought the Japanese/Germans were as friendly, efficient, creative, arrogant, intelligent, or regimented as other people, if Japanese/Germans were more difficult for Americans to deal with than most other types of people, if the relationship between the United States and Japan was good, and how they rated the impact of Japanese investment on the United States. In addition, respondents were asked if drugs or the trade deficit with Japan was the bigger problem, what the causes of the trade deficit were, if Japanese trade officers were negotiating in good faith, if United States negotiators needed to take a tougher line, and how they rated the effectiveness of various means of improving the trading situation. Other topics covered include Japanese economic power and Soviet military power as threats to the United States, anti-Japanese feelings in America, whether personal or family life was affected by Japanese activities in the United States, and whether Japan was trying to dominate the world. Background information on respondents includes education, age, social class, employment status, race, sex, income, and state/region of residence.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1990-03-13\" cycle=\"P1\">1990-03-13</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1990-03-15\" cycle=\"P1\">1990-03-15</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1990-03-13\" cycle=\"P1\">1990-03-13</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1990-03-15\" cycle=\"P1\">1990-03-15</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adults aged 18 and over living in households with telephones in the 48 contiguous United States.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Households were selected by random digit dialing.
