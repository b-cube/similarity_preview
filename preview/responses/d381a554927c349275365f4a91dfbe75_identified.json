CORMP consists of four focus areas: Ocean Observations, Data Management, Ecosystem Research and Modeling, and Outreach and Education that operate synergistically to: 1) provide a regional hub (SE US) in a national observing system; 2) collect and disseminate physical and ecological data; and 3) engage regional partners, stakeholders and end-users in the development and implementation of a sustainable coastal-ocean observing program. CORMP capitalizes on a combination of instrumented moorings, remote sensing and ecosystem models, and traditional ship-based observations to establish baseline conditions, identify responses to stochastic events, predict and verify long-term trends and identify linkages among coastal ocean ecosystem components. The information collected by CORMP help researchers determine a mechanistic understanding of factors affecting productivity in the coastal ocean in the region and will provide information that can be and is directly used in local-to federal fisheries management. Further, information collected by CORMP will be used by partner organizations to provide a real-time forecasting. The operational area for the CORMP observing network extends from estuaries (including the Cape Fear River Estuary and it's plume) to the coast, across the continental margin to the Gulf Stream, and from the SC/NC border to north of Cape Lookout. &lt;1&gt; Mooring: Core variables collected at each mooring includes water temperature and salinity, water column currents, surface wave directional spectra data. On some selected mooring stations, CORMP also measure turbidity and fluorescence. &lt;2&gt; Cruise: We sample the cape fear river plume every month by collecting data with a YSI-6820 Water Quality Sonde. This instrument measures (Temperature, Salinity, pH, Conductivity, Dissolved Oxygen, and Turbidity.) We collect Total Nitrate, Total phosphate, Nitrate, Phosphate, Ammonium and Chlorophyll a. Zooplankton samples are also collected at four of the plume stations. Our Onslow Bay sampling cruises are conducted bi-monthly. We sample six stations, each approximately five nautical miles apart, beginning at the Masonboro Inlet sea buoy and extending out to approximately 27 miles offshore. Our most offshore sampling station (OB27) also serves as the location for a fixed underwater instrument mooring. Basic data including time (GMT), latitude, longitude, water depth, sea surface temperature, weather conditions, and sea state are noted upon arrival at every station. When on station, scientists take measurements of physical parameters (temperature, currents, salinity, etc.), light attenuation and collect water samples for analysis of nutrients, phytoplankton pigments, and CDOM using a Seabird SBE-25 CTD rosette.</abstract>    <purpose>The strategic plan for the Congressionally mandated Integrated Ocean Observations System (IOOS) calls for a sustained, integrated system to improve weather forecasting, predictions of climate change and related impacts on coastal populations, safety and efficiency of marine operations, and coastal ecosystem health. The Coastal Ocean Research and Monitoring Program (CORMP) at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW) is a research and monitoring program that addresses these goals in the coastal ocean. The program mission is to provide an interdisciplinary science-based framework that supports sound public policy leading to wise coastal use, sustainable fisheries and improved coastal ocean ecosystem health.</purpose>    <supplinf>The penetration, absorption, and availability of light are of great importance in assessing the physico-chemical characteristics of a water mass. Changes in the optical characteristics of water masses may be used to determine the relative influences of anthropogenic or natural impacts on the biological components of coastal system. Coastal waters can vary greatly in their optical water quality and these variations affect photosynthetic compensation depths for phytoplankton and macrophytes and set fundamental limits on the rate of primary production of coastal waters (Gallegos et al., 1990). In optical studies it is necessary to determine both inherent and apparent optical properties; apparent optical latter properties vary in relation to both the content of the water and the ambient light field (Kirk, 1994). Inherent optical properties of coastal waters are affected by optically important variables such as turbidity (tripton), phytoplankton (chlorophylls, carotenoids, biliproteins, etc.), and dissolved organic matter (e.g., gilvin, CDOM) The individual components have an additive effect to the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient Kd(&amp;#955;)total. That is Kd(&amp;#955;)total= Kd(&amp;#955;)water + Kd(&amp;#955;)phytoplankton + Kd(&amp;#955;)tripton + Kd(&amp;#955;)gilvin Kd(&amp;#955;)total is most readiliy determined by measuring profiles of downwelling, cosine corrected spectral irradiance (Gallegos et al., 1990; Gallegos and Kenworthy, 1996). Partitioning the contributions to Kd(&amp;#955;)total, especially contributions by pigments and CDOM, can contribute to the development and refinement of algorithms used in remote sensing and bio-optical modeling of coastal waters. The resulting bio-optical models can be used for the purpose of satellite-based monitoring of the efficacy of management activities.</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>20000101</begdate>      <enddate>20060731</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>Observed</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>In Work</progress>    <update>As Needed</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-78.60</westbc>     <eastbc>-76.13</eastbc>     <northbc>34.81</northbc>     <southbc>33.14</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>GCMD</themekt>     <themekey>Water Quality, Turbidity, Ocean Color, Inherent &amp; Apparent Optical Properties,</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>None</placekt>     <placekey>Cape Fear River Plume, Onslow Bay, Long Bay, CMS, UNCW, Wilmington, North Carolina, Center for Marine Science, University of North Carolina at Wilmington, NOAA, CFP1, CFP2, CFP3, CFP4, CFP5, CFP6, CFP7, CFP8, CFP9, CFP11, CFP12, OBSB, OB5, OB10, OB15, OB20, OB27, OB27B, Gulf Stream, South Atlantic Bight</placekey>    </place>    <stratum>     <stratkt>None</stratkt>     <stratkey>water column, surface layer, photic zone, river plume, shelf waters</stratkey>    </stratum>    <temporal>     <tempkt>None</tempkt>     <tempkey>2005</tempkey>     <tempkey>2004</tempkey>     <tempkey>2003</tempkey>     <tempkey>2002</tempkey>     <tempkey>2001</tempkey>     <tempkey>2000</tempkey>    </temporal>   </keywords>   <accconst>None.

Collect 2-4 L surface water sample (fill bottle(s) 10 cm below surface). 2. Place sample in numbered 1 or 2L HDPE bottle, record bottle(s) number on data sheet, and place bottle in dark on ice. Laboratory processing - Raw and Filtered Water Samples Total spectral absorption will be measured on GF/F filters and water samples in a 10cm quartz cuvette in a cuvette chamber attached to Ocean Optics S2000 spectrometer and a halogen (filter samples) or Halogen-deuterium (water samples) light source. Always do 3 rinses of glassware when changing samples! For each station there will be three types of water placed in the cuvette: (B)lank = DI water, Yellow = 0.2 um filtered sample(CDOM) Total= Raw water sample 1. Pour about 300ml of Raw seawater sample into the Raw squirt bottle. This will be used for Total absorption. 2. Filter enough water onto a 47mm Whatman GF/F to result in visible color on filter (usually 500ml-1l for inshore and CFP samples and 4l for offshore OB samples). Place the GF/F filter in a numbered petri plate and wrap in foil or place in the dark on ice (or in refrigerator). . Record volume of water filtered and dish number on data sheet. 3. Refilter about 300 ml of the GF/F filtrate through a 0.2 um filter. This will be the Yellow (CDOM) fraction. Place this fraction in the CDOM squirt bottle. 4. Fill the 10 cm cuvette with distilled water Raw Sample vs Blank(DIwater) = Total spectral absorption Raw Sample vs Yellow (CDOM) = Spectral Absorption due to particles Yellow (CDOM) vs Blank (DIwater) = Spectral absorption due to dissolved substances (Gelbshtoff) 5.

Refill cuvette with 0.2um filtered water sample (CDOM vs Blank) to determine absorbance due to dissolved substances (yellow_st#). For CDOM use the halogen/deuterium light source with a 400um fiber, 75 int per., 10 av., and 10 boxcar. 14. Go to scope mode and Zero the CDOM sample by clicking on the light bulb icon. Click on A (absorbance) and make sure the red line is active near zero. Pour out the CDOM sample and refill cuvetted with Raw seawater. Click on the camera (snapshot). Save&gt;Processed&gt;filename.Master.Absorbance (Raw vs CDOM) (particles_st#). 15.Optical density is multiplied by 2.3 and 10 to convert to base e and to an absorption coefficient (m-1). [spectral absorption coefficient = (2.3 x absorbance)/0.1 m. 10cm cell=0.1m] Absorbance values are corrected for Backscattering by subtracting absorbance @750nm from all values. Laboratory processing - Particle and Phytoplankton coefficients 1. Total particle absorption spectra will be measured using the filter pad method by comparing absorption spectra through a wetted GF/F filter (distilled water) as the Blank and the spectra through the filter with particles. To correct for Mie scattering (and spectral differences between the reference and sample filters), the optical density at 750 nm is subtracted from the entire spectrum before calculating absorption. The halogen light source is used for these samples. 2. Filter 500 ml (CFP) to 4 l (OB) of water through a GF/F filter and record the volume on the data sheet. After filtering, place filter in a numbered glass plate and put in refrigerator. Keep in dark until ready to measure. 3.

A light profile will be determined by lowering the in-water sensor to a series of measurement depths (0.5-1.0 m intervals) and recording average (5-10 sec) scalar irradiance from both sensors. The in-air sensor reading will be used to adjust the in-water readings for changes in the incident irradiance over the course of the profile. KdPAR will be calculated from the slope of the regression of natural log-transformed percentages of surface irradiance (in water PAR:in air PAR) against depth. Downwelling, cosine-corrected, spectral irradiance [Kd(8)] from 200-850nm will be measured using a 200\\ufffdm optical fiber terminated with a cosine corrector and attached to an Ocean Optics S2000 spectrometer. Spectral irradiance will be determined at a series of measurement depths (0.5-1.0m). Readings will be normalized to the readings from the in-air sensor, natural-log transformed, and regressed against depth to calculate Kd(lambda) (wavelength-specific diffuse attenuation coefficient). Partitioning Kd(lambda): Water samples from discrete depth intervals will be analyzed for total and mineral solids, chlorophyll a, turbidity, and absorption by dissolved and particulate matter. Analyses of raw water versus filtered water samples will be used to separate the contribution to Kd(8) between particulate and dissolved components of the water mass. Total suspended solids (TSS) will be determined by filtering a known volume of water through a tared, precombusted (1 h @ 500 C) Whatman GF/F filter. Concentration of TSS will be determined by weight gain of dried filters and the volume of water filtered. Filters will then be combusted at 500 C for 2h to combust organic matter and reweighed. Mineral TSS will be determined by difference. Turbidity will be determined using YSI field instruments and chlorophyll a will be assessed as below. Absorbance of particulate matter will be determined by illuminating material collected on a GF/F filter with a fibre optic light source and measuring the absorbance spectra normalized with readings from a moistened blank filter. The sample filter will then be soaked in methanol for &gt;1h to extract phytoplankton pigments, and scanned again to estimate absorption by non-algal particulate matter. Absorption will be converted to units of m-1 by multiplying by the area of the filter and dividing by the volume filtered. Absorption by dissolved matter will be measured on water samples filtered through a 0.2\\ufffdm Nucleopore filter. Absorbance will be read using scanning spectrophotometer in 10 cm cells against distilled water blanks. Absorbance readings will be multiplied by 2.303 to convert to base e and divided by 0.1 (dm m-1).</procdesc>     <procdate>Unknown</procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>   <cloud>Unknown</cloud>  </dataqual>  <!--******************************** Section 3 ********************************-->  <spdoinfo>   <indspref>   The operational area for the UNCW CORMP observing network extends from estuaries (including the Cape Fear River Estuary and it's plume) to the coast, across the continental margin to the Gulf Stream, and from the SC/NC border to north of Cape Lookout.</indspref>   <direct>Point</direct>   <ptvctinf>    <sdtsterm>     <sdtstype>Point</sdtstype>     <ptvctcnt>25</ptvctcnt>    </sdtsterm>   </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <!--******************************** Section 4 ********************************-->  <!--******************************** Section 5 ********************************-->  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover>For details on the information cotained in the data set, please go to URL:http://www.cormp.org.
