The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution.  This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered &quot;provisional&quot;  until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp.  The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones.  A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics.  Mapping zone 37A encompasses whole or portions of several states, including the states of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana.  Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 37A can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov. </abstract> <purpose>The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its land use and land cover.</purpose> <supplinf> Corner Coordinates (center of pixel, projection meters) Upper Left Corner:  -45060.0 meters(X),  1308930.0 meters(Y) Lower Right Corner: -420360.0 meters(X),  689850.0 meters(Y) </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19990428</begdate> <enddate>20020615</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>In work</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-94.054813</westbc> <eastbc>-88.619117</eastbc> <northbc>33.023805</northbc> <southbc>28.835953</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>Land Cover</themekey> <themekey>GIS</themekey> <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey> <themekey>USGS</themekey> <themekey>digital spatial data</themekey> <themekey>Imagery</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Category</themekt> <themekey>imagery</themekey> <themekey>Base Maps</themekey> <themekey>Earth Cover</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology</placekt> <placekey>United States</placekey> <placekey>U.S.</placekey> <placekey>US</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>zone 37A</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1987, Codes for the identification of the States, the District of Columbia and the outlying areas of the United States, and associated areas (Federal Information Processing Standard 5-2): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology</placekt> <placekey>Texas</placekey> <placekey>TX</placekey> <placekey>Arkansas</placekey> <placekey>AR</placekey> <placekey>Louisiana</placekey> <placekey>LA</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>None</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntpos>Customer Services Representative</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address>USGS/EROS</address> <address>47914 252nd Street</address> <city>Sioux Falls</city> <state>SD</state> <postal>57198-0001</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>605/594-6151</cntvoice> <cnttdd>605/594-6933</cnttdd> <cntfax>605/594-6589</cntfax> <cntemail>custserv@usgs.gov</cntemail> <hours>0800 - 1600 CT, M - F (-6h CST/-5h CDT GMT)</hours> <cntinst> The USGS point of contact is for questions relating to the data display and download from this web site.

No formal independent accuracy assessment of mapping zone 37A land cover has been made.  The regression tree algorithm employed in NLCD 2001 mapping offers a cross-validation option for assessing classification and prediction reliability.  Cross-validation can provide relatively reliable estimates for land cover predictions if the reference data used for cross-validation are collected based on a statistically valid sampling design.  For mapping zone 37A land cover modeling, a 5-fold cross-validation was conducted by dividing the entire training data set into 5 subsets of equal size.  For each model run, an accuracy estimate was derived using one subset to evaluate the model prediction (with the model developed using the remaining training samples).  This process was repeated 5 times.  After all 5 runs, an average value of all accuracy estimates from the 5 runs were computed.  Users should be cautioned that these cross-validation results provide users with only first-order estimates of data quality, and should not be considered a formal accuracy assessment.  This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered &quot;provisional&quot; until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.</attraccr> <qattracc> <attraccv>87</attraccv> <attracce>The above listed value is the overall accuracy obtained for the land cover data using a cross-validation estimate from the decision tree model.

The land-cover database also includes three additional metadata layers that provide users a spatial node map of the land cover classification.  The three layers are: (a)  a spatial node map of the land cover classification, (b) a spatial confidence map of the land cover classification, and, (c) a text file of logical statements related to the land cover classification.  Conceptually, the descriptive tree is a classification tree generated by using the final minimum-map- unit land cover product (1 acre) as training data, and Landsat and other ancillary data as predictors. The goal of the descriptive tree is to summarize the effects of boosted trees (10 sequential classification trees) into a single condensed decision tree that can be used as a diagnostic tool for the classification process.  This descriptive tree can be used to assess the relative importance of each of the input data sets on each land cover class. Such information may also be useful to customize the minimum-mapping-unit classification to meet a user&apos;s specific needs through raster modeling. Descriptive trees usually capture 60 to 80% of the information from the original land cover data.  The leaf or terminal nodes of the descriptive tree are assigned to sequential numbers (called node numbers) and mapped across the entire mapping zone on a pixel-by-pixel basis. These node numbers can then be matched with the various conditional statements associated with each respective terminal node.  This spatial layer appears similar to a cluster map, but is the result of a supervised classification - not an unsupervised clustering. This node map can potentially be used as input by users to customize NLCD land cover, by linking the spatial extent of an individual node with the rules of the conditional statement.  The  Land Cover spatial classification confidence data layer is provided to users to help determine the per-pixel spatial confidence of the NLCD 2001 land cover prediction from the descriptive tree. The C5 algorithm produces an estimate (a value between 0% and 100%) that indicates the confidence of rule predictions at each node based on the training data.  This spatial confidence map should be considered as only one indicator of relative reliability of the land cover classification, rather than a precise estimate. Users should be aware that this estimate is made based on only training data, and is derived from a generalized descriptive decision tree that reproduces the final land cover data.  However, this layer provides valuable insight for a user to determine the risk or confidence they choose to place in each pixel of land cover.  A logic statement from a descriptive tree classification describes each classification rule for each classified pixel.  An example of the logic statement follows:  IF tasseled-cap wetness &gt; 140 and imperviousness  = 0 and canopy density &lt; 4, then classify as Water  This logic file can be used in combination with the spatial node map to identify classification logic and allow modifications of the classification based on user&apos;s knowledge and/or additional data sets.

The specific DT program employed is called C5, which implements a gain ratio criterion in tree development and pruning (Quinlan, 1993).  C5 also implemented several advanced features that can aid and improve land cover classification, including boosting and cross-validation.  Boosting is a technique for improving classification accuracy, while cross-validation can provide certain level of estimation regarding the  land cover classification quality.  In addition, C5 can generate a confidence estimate for each classified pixel and record the associated classification logic in a text file that can be readily interpreted and incorporated into a metadata system.  To conduct the land cover classification using DT, a large quantity of training data is required. For mapping zone 37A, training data were collected from several combined sources including the GAP and NLCD &apos;92 projects.  Note that the training data were used to map all land cover classes except for four classes in urban and sub-urban areas (developed open space, low intensity developed, medium intensity developed, high intensity developed).  All urban and suburban land cover classes were mapped and quality assessed separately through a sub-pixel quantification of impervious surfaces using a regression tree modeling method.  Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product.  The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section).  The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness &lt; 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness &gt; 79%).  Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product.  Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an &quot;area of interest&quot; (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI.  The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m  pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a &quot;smart eliminate&quot; algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.
