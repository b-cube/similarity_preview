Aims: In the present study, the effect of changes in testicular biometric parameters (weight and volume) and testicular function (Sperm count, morphology, testosterone level) in Cadmium chloride administered Wistar rats was studied. Methodology: Twenty male albino Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n=5). Group A (control) received rat chow and water, while Group B, C and D received 15mg/L, 20mg/L and 25mg/L of Cadmium chloride respectively for 6 weeks. Result: There was a significant (P=.05) and dose dependent decrease in testicular function parameters in the rats and a significant (P=.05) and positive correlation between the biometric parameters and testicular function. Conclusion: The findings showed that Cadmium chloride has a deleterious effect on testicular function and biometric parameters of the testes may be important in the assessment of testicular function.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>   </front>   <article-type>user-2231-0614-bjmmr</article-type> </article>   </articles>",
