From schoolboy convict to head of the prisoners union, Ben not only lived imprisonment, he studied it, making him one of the most potent penal reform commentators.</p> <p>Perpetually challenging perceived abuses of power, Ben honed both his theoretical appreciation and the practical power of nonviolent direct action. Two years after being released, having served 32 years, Ben embraces every opportunity, uses every possible medium, to provoke us to think about imprisonment.</p> <p>Building on Gandhian theories of active nonviolent action, and in the face of the Prison Services strategies to counter prisoners\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd uprisings developed since Strangeways, it will be argued that prisoners can organise and use active nonviolence to bring about penal reform.</p> <p><strong>Taking place on Wednesday 1 October 2014 at 5pm in the Peter Williams Lecture Theatre, Fielding Johnson Building. This event is free and open to all.</strong></p> <p>A wine reception will follow the lecture, providing an opportunity to speak to Ben.
