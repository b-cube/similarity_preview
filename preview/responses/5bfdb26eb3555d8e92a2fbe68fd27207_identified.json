The data types collected include bathymetry and topographic lidar point data, true color imagery and hyperspectral imagery. The collection effort follows the coastline and extends 500m inland and 1000m offshore or to laser extinction, whichever comes first. Topographic lidar is collected with 200% coverage, yielding a nominal 1m x 1m post-spacing. Where water conditions permit, the bathymetric lidar data will have a nominal post spacing of 4m x 4m. The true color imagery will have a pixel size approximately 35cm and the hyperspectral imagery will be provided in 1m pixels containing 36 bands between 375 - 1050 nm with 19 nm bandwidth. The final data is tied to horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, and are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID03 model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The NGS VDATUM program is used to transform the vertical positions collected along the Great Lakes coasts from NAVD88 to the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD85).</abstract><purpose>The JALBTCX has performed a coastal survey along the Gulf of Mexico coastline of LA in support of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP).</purpose><supplinf>These polygons represent the topographic and bathymetric lidar data coverage acquired during the survey.</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20110101</begdate><enddate>20111201</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>ground condition</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-88.890571</westbc><eastbc>-88.820527</eastbc><northbc>30.012203</northbc><southbc>29.760471</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>GCMD Data Center Keywords</themekt><themekey>DOD/USARMY/USACE/SAM/MOBILE/OPJ/JALBTCX &gt; Department of Defense, United States Army, United States Army Corps of Engineers, Mobile District, Spatial Data Branch, Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt><themekey>elevation</themekey><themekey>oceans</themekey><themekey>014</themekey><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey><themekey>010</themekey><themekey>006</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>GCMD Instrument Keywords</themekt><themekey>LIDAR &gt; LIGHT DETECTION AND RANGING</themekey><themekey>CASI &gt; COMPACT AIRBORNE SPECTROGRAPHIC IMAGER</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>ncdbNcmpRaster</themekey><themekey>NAVD88 0 contour</themekey><themekey>Land cover classification image</themekey><themekey>JALBTCX</themekey><themekey>Shoreline</themekey><themekey>ncdbNcmpShoreline</themekey><themekey>5m Raster</themekey><themekey>SHOALS</themekey><themekey>U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (NCMP)</themekey><themekey>Mobile District</themekey><themekey>CHARTS</themekey><themekey>IWG-OCM</themekey><themekey>1m Raster</themekey><themekey>Topography</themekey><themekey>Seafloor reflectance image</themekey><themekey>National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP)</themekey><themekey>Bathymetry</themekey><themekey>true color image</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>GCMD Earth Science Keywords</themekt><themekey>LAND SURFACE &gt; TOPOGRAPHY&gt; TERRAIN ELEVATION</themekey><themekey>OCEANS &gt; COASTAL PROCESSES &gt; COASTAL ELEVATION</themekey><themekey>OCEANS &gt; BATHYMETRY/SEAFLOOR TOPOGRAPHY &gt; SEAFLOOR TOPOGRAPHY</themekey><themekey>OCEANS &gt; BATHYMETRY/SEAFLOOR TOPOGRAPHY &gt; BATHYMETRY</themekey></theme><theme><themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey><themekey>location</themekey><themekey>oceans</themekey><themekey>elevation</themekey></theme><place><placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt><placekey>United States</placekey><placekey>Louisiana</placekey></place><place><placekt>GCMD Location Keywords</placekt><placekey>VERTICAL LOCATION &gt; SEA FLOOR</placekey><placekey>VERTICAL LOCATION &gt; LAND SURFACE</placekey></place><temporal><tempkt>None</tempkt><tempkey>October</tempkey><tempkey>July</tempkey><tempkey>2011</tempkey><tempkey>August</tempkey><tempkey>September</tempkey><tempkey>June</tempkey><tempkey>May</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>The data herein, including but not limited to geographic data, tabular data, analytical data, electronic data structures or files, are provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties or merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.

Otherwise, the single file is used. The file is converted to a grid by generating a triangulated irregular network (TIN) and then extracting the grid node elevations from the TIN surface. The origin point of the grid is located at a horizontal position whose value is evenly divisible by the 1m grid resolution such that rasters from subsequent surveys have common cell boundaries. JALBTCX uses Quick Terrain Modeler V7.1.1 to perform this operation utilizing the following key parameters; \"Max Sample Excursion 5,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd \"Max Triangle Side 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTiling Settings Snap to Grid (Expand).\" The grid is exported from Quick Terrain Modeler as an ESRI ASCII Z grid file.

It is owned by the Naval Oceanographic Office and operated through contract. The system collects topographic lidar data at 9kHz, bathymetric lidar data at 1kHz and true color imagery at 1Hz. Aircraft position, velocity and acceleration information are collected through a combination of Novatel and POS A/V 410 equipment. All raw data streams are transferred to the office for downloading and processing in SHOALS GCS software. Aircraft position data are processed using POSPac software and the results are combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. Upon inspection and QA/QC in the software packages Fledermaus and PFM_ABE, anomalous data are flagged as invalid. PFM_ABE's chartsLAS module then converts all valid data from ellipsoid to orthometric heights based on the NGS' GEOID03 model and exports data as a series of first return topography (TF), last return topography (TL) and bathymetry (H) ASCII files. The bathymetry files contain all of the returns from the bathymetric sensor which include returns both above and below the water.</procdesc><procdate>20120301</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>JALBTCX</cntorg></cntorgp><cntpos>Data Production Manager</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>unknown</addrtype><address>7225 Stennis Airport Rd., STE 100</address><city>Kiln</city><state>MS</state><postal>39556</postal><country>US</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>228-252-1121</cntvoice><cntvoice>228-252-1131</cntvoice><cntfax>228-252-1133</cntfax><cntemail>JALBTCX@usace.army.mil</cntemail><hours>8am - 5pm Monday through Friday</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Vector</direct><ptvctinf><sdtsterm><sdtstype>GT-polygon composed of chains</sdtstype><ptvctcnt>362</ptvctcnt></sdtsterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><geograph><latres>8.9831528411952117e-009</latres><longres>8.9831528411952117e-009</longres><geogunit>Decimal Degrees</geogunit></geograph><geodetic><horizdn>D North American 1983</horizdn><ellips>GRS 1980</ellips><semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis><denflat>298.257222101</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><detailed><enttyp><enttypl>LA_2011_Lidar_Coverage_USACE_NCMP</enttypl><enttypd>None</enttypd><enttypds>None</enttypds></enttyp><attr><attrlabl>FID</attrlabl><attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef><attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl><attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef><attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>Shape_Leng</attrlabl><attrdef>Length of features</attrdef><attrdefs>none</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>none</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>STATE</attrlabl><attrdef>State in which this lidar data was collected</attrdef><attrdefs>none</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>none</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>Shape_Area</attrlabl><attrdef>Area of feature in internal units squared.</attrdef><attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>Positive real numbers that are automatically generated.</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>Project_ID</attrlabl><attrdef>Project identifier</attrdef><attrdefs>none</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>none</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>feat_desc</attrlabl><attrdef>Feature description</attrdef><attrdefs>none</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>none</udom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>cmgrd_id</attrlabl><attrdef>Effort under which this lidar data was acquired</attrdef><attrdefs>none</attrdefs><attrdomv><udom>none</udom></attrdomv></attr></detailed></eainfo><distinfo><distrib><cntinfo><cntorgp><cntorg>Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX)</cntorg><cntper>Data Production Manager</cntper></cntorgp><cntpos>Data Production Manager</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>unknown</addrtype><address>7225 Stennis Airport Road, STE 100</address><city>Kiln</city><state>MS</state><postal>39556</postal><country>US</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>228-252-1121</cntvoice><cntvoice>228-252-1111</cntvoice><cntfax>228-252-1133</cntfax><cntemail>JALBTCX@usace.army.mil</cntemail><hours>8:00 - 5:00 Central</hours></cntinfo></distrib><resdesc>2011 USACE National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP) Lidar and Imagery Data Coverage Polygons</resdesc><distliab>See access and use constraints information.</distliab><stdorder><digform><digtinfo><formname>ASCII</formname></digtinfo><digtopt><onlinopt><computer><networka><networkr>http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/chartstopobathy/index.html</networkr><CI_OnlineResource><linkage>http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/chartstopobathy/index.html</linkage><name>NOAA Digital Coast</name><description>Download page for accessing USACE NCMP lidar point clouds</description><function>download</function></CI_OnlineResource></networka></computer></onlinopt></digtopt></digform><digform><digtinfo><formname>Web Mapping Service</formname></digtinfo><digtopt><onlinopt><computer><networka><networkr>http://maps.usace.army.mil:8399/arcgis/rest/services/JALBTCX/JALBTCX_Coverage/MapServer</networkr><CI_OnlineResource><linkage>http://maps.usace.army.mil:8399/arcgis/rest/services/JALBTCX/JALBTCX_Coverage/MapServer</linkage><name>JALBTCX Data Coverage Web Service</name><description>This service provides images of lidar data coverage polygons created by the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX) as part of the National Coastal Mapping Program (NCMP).
