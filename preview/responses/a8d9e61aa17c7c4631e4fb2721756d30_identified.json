The survey sampled 79 stations on islands of the Hawaiian chain and included all of the indicators of the NCA surveys.  The Hawaiian surveys,however, did not produce estimates of sediment toxicity because of insufficient soft sediments, and rather than assessing contaminant levels in fish, it assessed the body burdens of sea cucumbers.The Western Pilot-Coastal Monitoring is a large-scale, comprehensive environmental monitoring strategy designed to provide regional characterization of estuarine conditions along the West and Pacific Coasts of the United States.       </abstract>       <purpose>         To answer broad-scale questions on environmental conditions, EMAP and its partners have collected estuarine and coastal data from hundreds of stations along the coasts of the continental United States. Types of data include water column parameters, sediment chemistry and toxicity, benthic communities,demersal fish, and tissue contaminants. EMAP&apos;s National Coastal Assessment comprises all the estuarine and coastal sampling done by EMAP beginning in1990. This includes the sampling done in the biogeographic provinces as well as data from the Regional EMAP (REMAP) studies done by EPA Regional Offices. Program Objective EPA&apos;s National Coastal Assessment (NCA), is a five-year effort led by EPA&apos;s Office of Research and Development to evaluate the assessment methods it has developed to advance the science of ecosystem condition monitoring. C2000 represents the current state of evolution of EPA&apos;s EMAP. EMAP was originally designed to provide a quantitative assessment of the regional extent of environmental problems by measuring status and change in selected indicators of ecological condition.  EMAP provides a strategy to identify and bound the extent, magnitude and location of environmental degradation and improvement on a regional scale.Data Set Objective The objective of the sampling design is to provide a statistically defensible strategy for collecting information about selected indicators of ecological condition and their variability. The design is flexible to allow alternative future uses.       </purpose>       <supplinf>         NOAASupplemental:Entry_ID: UnknownSensor_Name: Sampling bags, nets, jars Sensor_Name: Hydrolab H2O Datasonde Sensor_Name: Hydrolab DO sensor Source_Name: small boat, SCUBA Project_Campaign: Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program National Coastal Assessment Monitoring Platform (CRIMP)Originating_Center: Western Ecology Division, US EPA Storage_Medium: ASCII Text Reference: None Online_size: 5809 kilobytes  Resource Description: NODC Accession Number 0061250       </supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>             20020401           </begdate>           <enddate>             20021030           </enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>         ground condition       </current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>         Complete       </progress>       <update>         Irregular       </update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>           -160.144         </westbc>         <eastbc>           -155.062         </eastbc>         <northbc>           22.217         </northbc>         <southbc>           19.723         </southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>           None         </themekt>         <themekey>           coastal data         </themekey>         <themekey>           benthic data         </themekey>         <themekey>           water quality         </themekey>         <themekey>           Benthic grab         </themekey>         <themekey>           Benthic grab summary         </themekey>         <themekey>           Benthic infauna station abundance         </themekey>         <themekey>           Benthic infauna replicate abundance         </themekey>         <themekey>           Fish community summary by station         </themekey>         <themekey>           Fish taxon abundance by station         </themekey>         <themekey>           Fish taxon and length abundance by station         </themekey>         <themekey>           Presence/absence and type of trash and debris         </themekey>         <themekey>           Sediment Chemistry Data         </themekey>         <themekey>           Sediment Grain Analyses Data         </themekey>         <themekey>           Sediment Toxicity Data         </themekey>         <themekey>           Tissue Chemistry Data         </themekey>         <themekey>           physical data         </themekey>         <themekey>           temperature         </themekey>         <themekey>           salinity         </themekey>         <themekey>           pH         </themekey>         <themekey>           turbidity         </themekey>         <themekey>           conductivity         </themekey>         <themekey>           dissolved oxygen         </themekey>         <themekey>           Nutrient data         </themekey>         <themekey>           nitrate         </themekey>         <themekey>           nitrite         </themekey>         <themekey>           phosphorus         </themekey>         <themekey>           silicate         </themekey>         <themekey>           nitrate/nitrite         </themekey>         <themekey>           chlorophyll a         </themekey>         <themekey>           ammonia         </themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>           ISO 19115 Topic Category         </themekt>         <themekey>           environment         </themekey>         <themekey>           007         </themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>           CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus         </themekt>         <themekey>           Numeric Data Sets &gt;

It provides a design that will allow probability-based estimates of the status of the Nation&apos;s estuarine systems, the variability associated with that status, its spatial and temporal components, and the temporal trends associated with changes in these systems.The Coastal 2000 sampling design is based on a single, annual sampling season of each station during the Index Period. The design differs from previous EMAP designs in that existing monitoring programs were incorporated where appropriate. &quot;Biased&quot; programs, such as those designed to evaluate the effects of a treatment plant, would NOT be appropriate for inclusion. Working with the states, the C2000 design team was able to identify a large number of sites that are currently being monitored and meet the criteria for being unbiased in their location. Many were randomly located in the original monitoring design.Data Acquisition Sampling Objective The navigation goal was to be within a 100 ft radius of the assigned latitude and longitude of a sampling site.Sample Collection Methods Summary The randomly selected Western Pilot sampling locations will be provided to the field crews as coordinates of latitude/longitude in degrees-minutes, expressed to the nearest 0.01 minute (i.e., 00 00.00&apos;).  The crews will use GPS to locate the site. The acceptable tolerance goal for siting is that the sampling station be established within 0.01 nm (\\ufffd\\ufffd100 ft) of the given coordinates. This reflects the accuracy expected from a properly functioning GPS unit of the caliber that will used for the study.  The GPS&apos;s performance should be verified on a daily basis.  Field crews will strictly adhere to the above guidelines for siting the station, unless there are substantiated reasons that prevent sampling within that defined area. All stations were visited by small boat whenever possible.Specific methodology is in the reference below.
