Here we present&#xD; a new Danian correlation framework resolved at the ~100-kyr&#xD; short-eccentricity level between the land-based Zumaia and&#xD; Sopelana hemipelagic sections from the Basque Basin and&#xD; deep-sea records drilled during ODP Legs 198 (Shatsky Rise,&#xD; North Pacific) and 208 (Walvis Ridge, South Atlantic) that&#xD; reconciles both the magnetostratigraphy and the short and longeccentricity&#xD; cycle patterns among the records and, hence,&#xD; improves synchroneity of events. The correlation has been&#xD; aided by composite images from ODP cores and a new wholerock&#xD; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd13C isotope record at Zumaia while its original&#xD; magnetostratigraphy (Dinar\\ufffd\\ufffds-Turell et al., 2003; 2010) is&#xD; reinforced by new data from Sopelana. Notably, we challenge&#xD; the correlation of the Pacific Sites 1209\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1210 that were offset&#xD; by as much as one 405-kyr cycle in previous interpretations&#xD; (i.e., the Fasciculithus spp. LO, which approximates the&#xD; Danian\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSelandian (D\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdS) boundary, and the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTop chron C27n\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#xD; climatic event were at odds between oceans in the&#xD; interpretation of Hilgen et al. (2010). It is found that the&#xD; Danian consists of 11 (and not 10) consecutive 405-kyr&#xD; eccentricity cycles.&#xD; The new consistent stratigraphic framework enables&#xD; accurate estimates to be made of ages for magnetostratigraphic&#xD; boundaries, bioevents, and sedimentation rates. Low&#xD; sedimentation rates appear common in all records in the mid-&#xD; Danian interval along the upper part of chron C28n, including&#xD; conspicuous condensed intervals in some of the oceanic&#xD; records that in the past have hampered the proper identification&#xD; of cycles. The new chronological framework, spanning a&#xD; duration of about 4.5 My, allows assessing the role of orbital&#xD; forcing on the paleoclimatic variability as registered by the&#xD; related isotope records. It appears clear that there exists a&#xD; periodic beat at the 100-ky and 405-ky eccentricity cycles&#xD; impressed in the record. The phase relationship between the&#xD; benthic isotope record and eccentricity is similar to patterns&#xD; documented for the Oligocene and Miocene, as indicated by&#xD; others, confirming the role of orbital forcing as the pace maker&#xD; for paleoclimatic variability on Milankovitch time scales. The&#xD; preferred tuning to the La2011 orbital solution provides&#xD; astronomically calibrated ages of 66.022\\ufffd\\ufffd0.040 Ma and&#xD; 61.607\\ufffd\\ufffd0.040 Ma for the (D\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdS) and Cretaceous\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPaleogene&#xD; (K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg) boundaries respectively. Finally, we envisage that the&#xD; Zumaia section, which already hosts the Selandian GSSP,&#xD; could serve as the global Danian stratotype.</description>     <dc:date>2014-06-30T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9208\">     <title>Data report: paleomagnetism and rock magnetism of sediments from offshore Canterbury Basin, IODP Expedition 317</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9208</link>     <description>Title: Data report: paleomagnetism and rock magnetism of sediments from offshore Canterbury Basin, IODP Expedition 317 Authors: Dinar\\ufffd\\ufffds-Turell, J.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Tinto, K.; Department of Geology, University of Otago, PO Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand Abstract: Paleomagnetic and rock magnetic analyses were conducted on&#xD; discrete samples from sediments drilled during Integrated Ocean&#xD; Drilling Program Expedition 317 in the Canterbury Basin offshore&#xD; New Zealand to assess the nature of magnetic remanence and to&#xD; evaluate the directional data for a magnetic reversal stratigraphy.&#xD; The sediments consist of relatively coarse grained lithologies from&#xD; shelf to slope settings. The presence of several hiatuses, together&#xD; with very low core recovery in some intervals as well as drillingrelated&#xD; magnetic overprints, prevented establishment of a good&#xD; shipboard magnetostratigraphy. In an effort to overcome some of&#xD; the magnetic shortcomings and to substantiate shipboard measurements&#xD; (overprints and partial demagnetization to 20 mT),&#xD; natural remanent magnetization and subsequent full stepwise alternating&#xD; field or thermal demagnetization measurements were&#xD; taken on 765 individual discrete samples from Holes U1351B (131&#xD; samples), U1352B/U1352C (485 samples), U1353B (54 samples),&#xD; and U1354B/U1354C (95 samples). Some rock magnetic measurements,&#xD; including thermomagnetic curves, were taken on a few&#xD; representative samples to acquire information on the magnetic&#xD; carriers. The remanence intensity of the sediments is relatively&#xD; low (usually 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3 to 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd5 A/m) and often displays unstable behavior&#xD; upon demagnetization. Demagnetization data have been separated&#xD; into four different classes based on their quality. Classes 1&#xD; and 2 are of sufficient quality to be used for magnetostratigraphic&#xD; purposes and represent ~40% of the studied samples (although&#xD; some of them could still represent a steep magnetic drilling overprint).&#xD; Considering the calculated characteristic remanent magnetization&#xD; inclination, a number of polarity zones can be defined.&#xD; However, the fragmentary nature of the data set, mostly related to&#xD; core recovery in addition to detected and undetected sedimentary&#xD; hiatuses, makes determination of the precise position of the reversal&#xD; boundaries and their correlation to the geomagnetic polarity&#xD; timescale a difficult task. Nevertheless, when combined shipboard&#xD; and postcruise discrete measurements are placed within biostratigraphic&#xD; constraints, some magnetostratigraphic insights can potentially&#xD; refine the available age model. These insights include the&#xD; identification of the Matuyama/Brunhes boundary (C1r1r/C1n,&#xD; 0.778 Ma) at all four sites, the Gauss/Matuyama boundary&#xD; (C2An.1n/C2r.2r, 2.581 Ma) in Hole U1351B, and also the position&#xD; of the Olduvai Subchron (C2n, 1.778\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1.945 Ma) in Hole U1351B, which relates to the position of the classical&#xD; Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-06T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9206\">     <title>In Search of the Bartonian (Middle Eocene) GSSP (II): Preliminary Results from the Oyambre Section (Northern Spain)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9206</link>     <description>Title: In Search of the Bartonian (Middle Eocene) GSSP (II): Preliminary Results from the Oyambre Section (Northern Spain) Authors: Dinar\\ufffd\\ufffds-Turell, J.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Payros, A.; Fac.

The sections were correlated at a bed-by-bed scale through careful analysis of the lithological stacking pattern and significant sedimentary features. For spectral analysis, we used an available carbonate proxy record spanning 64 m of section below the K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg (Cretaceous\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPalaeogene) boundary at Zumaia containing 72 precession-related limestone\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmarl couplets. The continuous wavelet spectrum helped to determine and visualize the orbital forcing at both the short (~100 kyr) and long (405 kyr) eccentricity bands. We applied bandpass Gaussian filters to the carbonate record to extract the relevant periodicities and provide a cycle-numbering scheme starting at the K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg boundary. The full hierarchy of precession cycles and eccentricity-related bundles was then extended towards the base of the Zumaia section, which contains 33 short eccentricity-related bundles, thus spanning more than 3 Myr. The C31r\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdC31n chron boundary (estimated to occur at ~3.08 Myr prior to the K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPg boundary) in the lower part of the succession was determined unambiguously in all three sections studied, although the C30n\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdC29r reversal could not be determined due to a pervasive reverse magnetization acting on the purplish lithologies in the upper part of the succession. Relevant calcareous plankton bioevents were able to be accurately placed on the cyclo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmagnetostratigraphic template. The cyclostratigraphic framework also allowed us to estimate the duration of previously defined sea-level-related, third-order depositional sequences in the basin, which appear to be strongly paced by the long-term 1.2 Myr obliquity amplitude modulating cycle.</description>     <dc:date>2013-06-30T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8953\">     <title>An analysis of tropical instability waves in a numerical  model of the Pacific Ocean -  2.

H.; Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences  Program, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey; Bush, A. B. G.; Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Abstract: The instability processes &#xD; which generate unstable waves with chara- &#xD; cteristics similar to observed &#xD; tropical instability waves in the Pacific Ocean are &#xD; examined through a local energy analysis based on deviations from the time mean &#xD; flow. Numerical experiments indicate that the waves develop preferentially in the &#xD; eastern Pacific along the northern temperature front and have a westward phase &#xD; speed and a structure with two peaks in amplitude: one located on the equator &#xD; and the other a few degrees &#xD; north of it. The energy analysis shows that the &#xD; \"two-peak\" structure of the eastern waves is explained by two different instability &#xD; processes &#xD; which occur at different latitudes. In the time mean sense &#xD; the region &#xD; north of the equator is baroclinically unstable, while barotropic instability prevails &#xD; at the equator. The life cycle of the waves is revealed by the time evolution of &#xD; the energetics. Baroclinic instability is the dominant triggering mechanism &#xD; which &#xD; induces growth of the waves along the northern temperature front. The eddy &#xD; pressure &#xD; fluxes radiate energy south of the equator where the rneridional shear &#xD; between the Equatorial Undercurrent and the South Equatorial Current becomes &#xD; barotropically unstable. From the numerical simulations, there is evidence of &#xD; a second &#xD; unstable region in the central Pacific south of the equator where the &#xD; instabilities have a lower phase speed. The energy analysis also shows &#xD; that these &#xD; waves &#xD; grow from both barotropic and baroclinic conversions.</description>     <dc:date>1999-12-14T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8952\">     <title>An analysis of tropical instability waves in a numerical  model of the Pacific Ocean - 1.

Spatial variability of the waves Authors: Masina, S.; Istituto di Scienze dell'Atmosfera e dell'Oceano, CNR, Bologna, Italy.; Philander, S. G. H.; Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences  Program, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey Abstract: Unstable oscillations confined within the mixed layer close to the &#xD; equator are generated &#xD; in wind-forced &#xD; experiments &#xD; performed in a multilevel general &#xD; circulation model configured &#xD; for the tropical Pacific Ocean. The experiments &#xD; indicate that the waves develop preferentially in the eastern Pacific along the &#xD; northern temperature front. However, there is clear evidence of a second &#xD; unstable &#xD; region &#xD; along the southern &#xD; temperature &#xD; front in the central Pacific. In both regions &#xD; the instabilities propagate westward, but in the central Pacific their phase speed &#xD; is considerably &#xD; smaller. The differences &#xD; between the wave characteristics &#xD; in the &#xD; eastern and central Pacific are closely correlated to the differences &#xD; in the time &#xD; mean conditions of the flow. The eastern instabilities have a structure with two &#xD; peaks in amplitude: one located on the equator and the other a few degrees &#xD; north &#xD; of it. Their dispersion &#xD; characteristics &#xD; show many similarities to those of tropical &#xD; instability &#xD; waves &#xD; (TIWs) observed &#xD; in the Pacific &#xD; Ocean, &#xD; while the instabilities &#xD; which &#xD; grow in the central Pacific do not have any known observed &#xD; correspondents. &#xD; We &#xD; explore the spatial variability of the simulated waves through a wavelet analysis, &#xD; which provides &#xD; detailed results on how the period and wavelength of the instabilities &#xD; change &#xD; as a function &#xD; of longitude, &#xD; latitude, and depth. The wavelet &#xD; analysis &#xD; reveals &#xD; that in the eastern Pacific and close to the surface the TIWs have a phase speed &#xD; of-48 cm/s, while in the central &#xD; Pacific &#xD; they have &#xD; a phase &#xD; speed &#xD; of-11 cm/s. In &#xD; particular, the change &#xD; in the phase &#xD; speed &#xD; is due to a change &#xD; in the dominant period &#xD; of the TIWs: The period of the central Pacific instabilities is considerably &#xD; longer &#xD; than the period of the instabilities present in the eastern Pacific.</description>     <dc:date>1999-12-14T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8951\">     <title>A global ocean temperature and altimeter data assimilation system  for studies of climate variability</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8951</link>     <description>Title: A global ocean temperature and altimeter data assimilation system  for studies of climate variability Authors: Masina, S.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Bologna, Bologna, Italia; Pinardi, N.; University of Bologna, Ravenna, Italy; Navarra, A.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Bologna, Bologna, Italia Abstract: An ocean data assimilation (ODA) system &#xD; which can assimilate both temperature and altimeter observations has been applied to the global ocean and tested between January 1993-October 1996. A statistical method has been used to convert sea surface height (SSH) anomalies observations from TOPEX/POSEIDON into synthetic temperature profiles. The innovative aspect of this method is the introduction of time &#xD; dependency in the correlations used to transform the altimeter observations into temperature corrections. The assimilation system is based on a univariate variational optimal interpolation scheme applied to assimilate both in situ and synthetic temperature profiles. In addition, a longer global analysis for the upper-ocean temperature starting from January 1979 and ending November 1997, has been produced to examine the skill of sea temperature assimilation with a rather simple and practical &#xD; method. The temperature analysis shows encouraging &#xD; improvement over a corresponding ocean simulation &#xD; when compared to independent (not assimilated) temperature data both at seasonal and interannual time &#xD; scales. However, the univariate data assimilation of &#xD; hydrographic data does not result in an improvement of &#xD; the velocity field. In fact the assimilation of sparse in situ &#xD; data can introduce unrealistic spatial variability in the &#xD; temperature field which affects the velocity field in a negative way. This deficiency is partially overcome when &#xD; we also assimilate altimeter observations since the coverage is complete and uniform for this data. In particular, our study shows that temperature corrections due &#xD; to the altimeter signal have a positive impact on the &#xD; current system in the tropical Pacific.</description>     <dc:date>2001-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8950\">     <title>Instabilities of continuously strati\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffded zonal equatorial jets in a  periodic channel model</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8950</link>     <description>Title: Instabilities of continuously strati\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffded zonal equatorial jets in a  periodic channel model Authors: Masina, S.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Bologna, Bologna, Italia Abstract: Several numerical experiments are performed in &#xD; a nonlinear, multi-level periodic channel model centered on &#xD; the equator with different zonally uniform background \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdows &#xD; which resemble the South Equatorial Current (SEC). Analy- &#xD; sis of the simulations focuses on identifying stability criteria &#xD; for a continuously strati\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffded \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffduid near the equator. A 90 m &#xD; deep frontal layer is required to destabilize a zonally uni- &#xD; form, 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd wide, westward surface jet that is symmetric about &#xD; the equator and has a maximum velocity of 100 cm/s. In this &#xD; case, the phase velocity of the excited unstable waves is very &#xD; similar to the phase speed of the Tropical Instability Waves &#xD; (TIWs) observed in the eastern Paci\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdc Ocean. The vertical &#xD; scale of the baroclinic waves corresponds to the frontal layer &#xD; depth and their phase speed increases as the vertical shear &#xD; of the jet is doubled. When the westward surface parabolic &#xD; jet is made asymmetric about the equator, in order to simu- &#xD; late more realistically the structure of the SEC in the eastern &#xD; Paci\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdc, two kinds of instability are generated. The oscilla- &#xD; tions that grow north of the equator have a baroclinic nature, &#xD; while those generated on and very close to the equator have &#xD; a barotropic nature. &#xD; This study shows that the potential for baroclinic instabil- &#xD; ity in the equatorial region can be as large as at mid-latitudes, &#xD; if the tendency of isotherms to have a smaller slope for a &#xD; given zonal velocity, when the Coriolis parameter vanishes, &#xD; is compensated for by the wind effect.
