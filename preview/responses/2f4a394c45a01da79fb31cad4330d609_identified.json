Coverages are based on official New York State Freshwater Wetlands Maps as described in Article 24-0301 of the Environmental Conservation Law. Coverages are not, however, a legal substitute for the official maps. Coverages are available on a county basis for all areas of New York State outside the Adirondack Park.</abstract>         <purpose>To provide a faithful representation of official New York State regulatory freshwater wetlands maps for GIS resource analysis at scales equal to the 1 to 24,000 scale of original mapping or smaller scales (e.g., 1 to 100,000 scale).</purpose>         <supplinf>Regulatory maps consist of mylar versions of New York State Department of Transportation 1 to 24,000 planimetric maps on which wetland boundaries and wetland identification codes are drawn. Planimetric maps are generally congruent with and have the same quad names as United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute topographic maps; a few of the Department of Transportation quads have extended borders. Regulatory wetland maps are prepared by NYSDEC and filed as required by the Freshwater Wetlands Act (Article 24 of the Environmental Conservation Law). Associated with the maps are Classification Sheets that list the Wetlands Identification Code, the municipality in which the wetland occurs and the regulatory class of each wetland. Preparation and filing dates vary by county. As amendments to the official maps occur, the coverages are updated so that the GIS information reflects the regulatory maps currently in use. Archive copies of county coverages with previous versions of the official maps are kept. An important feature of the offical maps is that the lines indicate only \"the approximate location of the actual boundaries of the wetlands\" (ECL Section 24-0301(3)). For a final determination of the actual location of a wetland it is necessary to contact the NYSDEC office for the region in which the wetland occurs. For a sample of what a county coverage looks like, see &lt;http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu/SAMPLES/001fwa.gif&gt; (Note: Example is for Albany County).</supplinf>      </descript>       <timeperd>        <timeinfo>          <rngdates>            <begdate>19890000</begdate>             <enddate>Present</enddate>          </rngdates>        </timeinfo>         <current>Publication date per county.

The documentation in the Entity and Attribute Overview section of the metadata, and the README referred to in that section, are integral parts of the Regulatory Freshwater Wetlands data. Failure to use the documentation in conjunction with the digital data constitutes a misuse of the data. 2. The digital freshwater wetlands data provided are not a legal substitute for the official Regulatory Freshwater Wetlands maps maintained by the Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to Environmental Conservation Law Section 24-0301. Should a discrepancy exist between the digital data and the official maps, the official maps are the correct source of information. 3. The official regulatory freshwater wetlands maps may be amended from time to time; digital data obtained at an earlier date may therefore become obsolete. Digital data also may be altered independently of official map amendments in order to make improvements. These digital data cannot be relied on as a definitive statement of the location of freshwater wetlands. Wetland boundaries are subject to delineation by Department of Environmental Conservation regional personnel. 4. The borders of wetlands shown on both the official maps and the digital data are approximate at a scale of 1 to 24,000. Traditional cartographic or digital comparison of the wetland maps to mapped information that is collected and digitized at a larger scale than 1 to 24,000 is not cartographically acceptable and is subject to error. 5. It is inappropriate to make further distributions of the data, because digital wetlands data are not official regulatory maps and are subject to change. All requests for the digital wetlands data should be referred to the Cornell University Geospatial Information Repository &lt;http://cugir.mannlib.cornell.edu&gt; or to the Habitat Inventory Unit, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, 5th Floor, Albany, New York 12233-4754, telephone (518)402-8961.</useconst>       <ptcontac>        <cntinfo>          <cntperp>            <cntper>Pete Gradoni</cntper>             <cntorg>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation - Division of Fish, Wildlife &amp; Marine Resources</cntorg>          </cntperp>           <cntaddr>            <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>             <address>625 Broadway, 5th Floor</address>             <city>Albany</city>             <state>NY</state>             <postal>12233-4754</postal>          </cntaddr>           <cntvoice>(518) 402-8961</cntvoice>           <cntfax>(518) 402-8925</cntfax>           <cntemail>pbgradon@gw.dec.state.ny.us</cntemail>           <hours>8:45AM - 4:45PM EST</hours>        </cntinfo>      </ptcontac>    </idinfo>     <dataqual>      <attracc>        <attraccr>See Entity and Attribute Information</attraccr>      </attracc>       <logic>See Process Description</logic>       <complete>See Currentness Reference</complete>       <posacc>        <horizpa>          <horizpar>Wetland boundaries were delineated as \"approximate\" on 1 to 24,000 scale maps using a variety of methods, including aerial photographic interpretation, reference to published maps and field investigations. However, due to changes over time in the wetland resource, field verification of wetland boundaries is increasingly important. Digital wetland borders are derived from individual 1 to 24,000 quads, either by digitizing or by scanning followed by semi-automated raster to vector conversion. Quality assurance and quality control procedures included overlay of plot of digital boundaries on original source map with the condition for acceptance being no visible separation allowed between boundaries.</horizpar>        </horizpa>      </posacc>       <lineage>        <srcinfo>          <srccite>            <citeinfo>              <origin>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation</origin>               <pubdate>19980000</pubdate>               <title>New York State Freshwater Wetlands Map</title>               <geoform>map</geoform>            </citeinfo>          </srccite>           <srcscale>24000</srcscale>           <typesrc>stable-base material</typesrc>           <srctime>            <timeinfo>              <rngdates>                <begdate>19840000</begdate>                 <enddate>19980000</enddate>              </rngdates>            </timeinfo>             <srccurr>Publication Date</srccurr>          </srctime>           <srccitea>NYSFWW</srccitea>           <srccontr>Spatial and attribute information</srccontr>        </srcinfo>         <procstep>          <procdesc>Wetland borders are derived from individual 1 to 24,000 quads, either by digitizing or by scanning followed by semi-automated raster to vector conversion. Labels are added and coded with the wetland identification and class. Annotation indicating the wetland identification code is also added. The quads comprising a county are edge matched and map joined to form a county coverage. Quadrangle borders of wetlands that cross quads are dissolved away. Where contiguous wetlands on adjacent regulatory quad sheets do not match, arcs are added along the quad border between the wetland pieces on either side of the border so that a continuous polygon is formed. Wetland class in the coverage is checked against an ASCII file derived from the official classification sheets. Class and wetland ID are added to arcs using an automated procedure that derives arc attribute values from polygon attribute values. Data are tiled as coverages showing wetlands of a single county. Detailed protocols are maintained by the Habitat Inventory Unit.
