The data set includes previous lot lines (dashed consolidation lines), parcel connectors (z-hooks), parcel boundaries, printkey boundaries, deed boundaries, municipal boundaries, block boundaries, tax map boundaries, special district boundaries, and text layers for lot numbers, acreage, dimensions, etc.</abstract>         <purpose>The parcel boundaries represent legal descriptions of property ownership, as recorded in various public documents in the Tompkins County Clerk's Office.</purpose>         <supplinf>Only arcs (lines) have their boundaries updated during parcel revisions. Polygons are built from the arcs (lines) and label points (polygon centroids). All regions, except for the Condo region, are automatically created with a macro, based on values in the polygon's attributes. The arcs (lines) are coded to allow previous lot lines (i.e., dashed consolidation lines), parcel connectors (z-hooks), and yearly changes to be shown and tracked. All text is kept in annotation layers, organized by the name of the text layer. Regions are used to represent parcel boundaries, municipal boundaries, deeded areas, block boundaries, tax map boundaries, and special districts. There are two regions representing property boundaries (parcel and printkey) because properties that are tracked by an account number (state lands, utilities, railroads, etc.) may be shown as several separate tax parcel boundaries, with different tax map print keys, even though they are tracked in the Real Property Services (RPS) database under the same account number and treated as one single parcel for taxation purposes. The parcel region will show these account-number properties as one tax parcel boundary, while the printkey region will show each separate tax parcel boundary that is a part of the account number.</supplinf>      </descript>       <status>        <progress>Complete</progress>         <update>Continually</update>      </status>       <spdom>        <bounding>          <westbc>-76.43934</westbc>           <eastbc>-76.23547</eastbc>           <northbc>42.41797</northbc>           <southbc>42.29588</southbc>        </bounding>      </spdom>       <keywords>        <theme>          <themekt>None</themekt>           <themekey>Land record</themekey>           <themekey>Parcel</themekey>           <themekey>Assessment Department</themekey>           <themekey>RPS</themekey>        </theme>         <theme>          <themekt>LCSH</themekt>           <themekey>New York (State) -- Office of Real Property Services.</themekey>        </theme>         <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>         <themekey>planningCadastre</themekey>       </theme>       <place>          <placekey>Tompkins County (N.Y.)</placekey>           <placekey>New York (State)</placekey>           <placekey>Finger Lakes Region (N.Y.) -- Maps.</placekey>           <placekey>Enfield (N.Y.)</placekey>        </place>         <temporal>          <tempkt>None</tempkt>           <tempkey>2000</tempkey>        </temporal>      </keywords>       <accconst>None</accconst>       <useconst>The following statement must be included with any products that use or are derived from this data set: Data contained in this product was originally produced by the Tompkins County GIS Program.

Lines are coded by the Layer field, and checked visually on-screen as they are updated, using a lookup table which shows the layers as various line types. Revision sheets are printed after each change to the data set, and are visually reviewed for errors. Regions are created by merging polygons with similar attributes (there is no manual user involvement). After the current-year tax roll is finalized by the Assessment Department, an extract of the roll is compared to the Parcel Region. Any identified errors are corrected, then the roll is compared again with the Parcel Region, until all errors have been eliminated. Other regions are checked visually for gaps, holes, and other problems, then corrected. Draft tax maps are produced in ArcView, then visually reviewed for errors. The final product is a data set and series of paper maps that reflect the final tax roll for a given tax year. The attributes in the various fields used to produce regions were originally populated using ArcView software. A \"unique value\" legend was used to aid in the visual identification of errors. After the regions were first created, further errors were identified visually by reviewing each region. New region layers will be created in the same way. The 1999 printed tax maps were reviewed for spatial and textual errors by the Assessment Department and New York State Office of Real Property Services (NYS ORPS). A quick analysis comparing calculated acreages in the data set to acreages recorded in the final tax roll was performed during 1999 and showed that the majority of parcels had GIS acreages within the NYS ORPS error guidelines.</logic>       <complete>Complete coverage for the City of Ithaca.

In 1991, a series of planimetric base data sets were produced from aerial photography, and are now referred to as the 1991 Tompkins County Digital Planimetric Base Map. The tax parcel mylar maps were digitized using MapGrafix and referenced to the 1991 Tompkins County Digital Planimetric Base Map. In 1997, the MapGrafix data sets for the City of Ithaca and the Towns of Caroline and Danby were approved by the New York State Office of Real Property Services (NYS ORPS). In 1998, the Map Grafix data sets were converted to Arc/Info for the City of Ithaca, Towns of Caroline, Danby, Dryden, and Ithaca, and the Villages of Cayuga Heights, Dryden, and Freeville. In 1999, the Towns of Enfield, Groton, Lansing, Newfield, and Ulysses, and the Villages of Groton, Lansing, and Trumansburg were converted to Arc/Info. Beginning with the 1999 tax year, all tax parcel boundaries are maintained in Arc/Info, all tax maps are printed using ArcView, and all tax maps are archived digitally using Adobe Acrobat, as well as the traditional paper archival. During the transition period from paper to digital maps, parcel boundaries are approximate, except for those boundaries that have been input using paper surveys and legal descriptions. The tax parcel data sets consist of three groups of layers: boundary layers, text layers, and region layers. The boundary layers consist of those Arc/Info feature classes upon which the region layers are created. Boundary layers include the nodes, arcs, and polygons. Parcel boundaries are changed by first modifying the arc and node layers, and updating the arc attributes. Next, the polygons are re-created and their attributes are updated. The text layers are then updated to reflect the boundary changes. Finally, the regions are created from the polygons using polygon attributes and the Arc/Info REGIONDISSOLVE command. The text layers are Arc/Info annotation layers and include acreage, block, dimension, non-roll section 1 (exempt/utility/state lands), lot, Military Tract/Watkins and Flint Purchase, municipality, place, road name, special district, tax map, tic mark, and water text, as it appears on the printed tax parcel maps. The region layers include deed book/page, municipal, parcel, printkey, and tax map regions. The printkey regions from each of the municipal data sets for the current tax year are then combined into a county-wide data set, which is then converted to an ArcView shapefile. Regions for special districts are derived from polygon attributes in the same manner as the other regions, for each municipality, then combined into a County-wide special districts data set. Regions for public lands are similiarly combined and converted into a County-wide public lands data set.</procdesc>           <procdate>1990-2000</procdate>           <proccont>            <cntinfo>              <cntorgp>                <cntorg>Tompkins County ITS GIS Division</cntorg>                 <cntper>Kirk Eby</cntper>              </cntorgp>               <cntpos>GIS Project Leader</cntpos>               <cntaddr>                <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>                 <address>128 East Buffalo Street</address>                 <city>Ithaca</city>                 <state>New York</state>                 <postal>14850</postal>                 <country>USA</country>              </cntaddr>               <cntvoice>(607) 274-5418</cntvoice>               <cntfax>(607) 274-5420</cntfax>               <cntemail>gis@tompkins-co.org</cntemail>               <hours>M-F 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</hours>            </cntinfo>          </proccont>        </procstep>      </lineage>       <cloud>0</cloud>    </dataqual>     <spdoinfo>      <direct>Vector</direct>       <ptvctinf>        <sdtsterm>          <sdtstype>Link</sdtstype>        </sdtsterm>         <sdtsterm>          <sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype>        </sdtsterm>         <sdtsterm/>      </ptvctinf>    </spdoinfo>     <spref>      <horizsys>        <planar>          <gridsys>            <gridsysn/>             <spcs/>             <spcs>              <spcszone>3102</spcszone>               <transmer>                <sfctrmer>0.9999375</sfctrmer>                 <longcm>-76.5833333334</longcm>                 <latprjo>40</latprjo>                 <feast>250000</feast>                 <fnorth>0</fnorth>              </transmer>            </spcs>          </gridsys>           <planci>            <plance>Coordinate Pair</plance>             <coordrep>              <absres>1</absres>               <ordres>1</ordres>            </coordrep>             <plandu>survey feet</plandu>          </planci>        </planar>         <geodetic>          <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>           <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>           <semiaxis>6378206</semiaxis>           <denflat>294.9786982</denflat>        </geodetic>      </horizsys>    </spref>     <eainfo>      <detailed>        <enttyp>          <enttypl>Base Area Layer (Polygons, CAPRCL2000.PAT)</enttypl>           <enttypd>Polygons provide the basis for all other area layers (regions), which are produced from attributes of the polygons.
