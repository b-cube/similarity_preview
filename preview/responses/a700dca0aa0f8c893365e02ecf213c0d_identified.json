The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The special soil features point layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped.</abstract> <purpose>SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape.

The tests of logical consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

Each map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified on the map is a delineation. Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas that have properties and behavior significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they may not be indicated on the map. A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas (map unit components), each with a designated range in proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little or no recognizable soil. Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map units, and location of special soil features. These standards are outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993, USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995, USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, (current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS. The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit delineations were based on data collected by scientists during the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and undifferentiated groups. Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting. Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist of two or more dissimilar components that occur in a regularly repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether complex or association is used in the name. The major components of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In either case, because the major components are sufficiently different in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association, each major component is normally present though their proportions may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent. Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two or more components that are not consistently associated geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in the same map delineation. These components are included in the same named map unit because their use and management are the same or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to undifferentiated groups as to consociations. Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend, one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per 3,000 acres. A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of about 2.5 acres.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that meet National Map Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000 feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies with the transition between map units. For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological

All three surveys were at a scale of 1:62500. A revised soil mapping legend was established in the 1950's and mapping was updated during the late 1960's. An evaluation of the updated mapping indicated that the mapping was not adequate for a modern order two soil survey due to significant changes in landuse, soil classification, soil interpretations, and soil mapping standards and procedures.</procdesc> <srcused>SCS1, SCS2, SCS3</srcused> <procdate>19680101</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Field procedures were used to combine the three previous individual soil survey areas into a single soil survey. Soil map unit boundaries were determined by field observations and by interpretation of remotely sensed data on 1:12000 scale aerial photography. Boundaries were verified at closely spaced intervals with the soils in each delineation (map unit) identified by traversing and transecting the landscape. The soil scientists conducting the survey observed the soils in the field, described and sampled the soils, and analyzed the samples in the laboratory.

Six 7.5 minute quadrangles of soil maps were digitized by the University of Rhode Island, Environmental Data Center under a cooperative agreement with the Soil Conservation Service. The portion of the state covering the Scituate Reservoir watershed (approximately 93 square miles) was digitized, under contract, by Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. The remainder of the state was digitized by Hammon Jensen, Wallen &amp; Associates using ArcInfo, version 4.0.1. The contracts were prepared and held by the University of Rhode Island, Environmental Data Center, with cooperative review by the SCS. SCS personnel edited the proof plots provided by the contractors. (NOTE: At the completion of this process, the Rhode Island Board of Governors of Higher Education copyrighted the spatial soils data.

These maps were used as the compilation base. They were used as a base map, to ensure a match to other data layers created by the State of Rhode Island. Soil lines were compiled using the publication annotated overlay. The color infrared aerial photography was used for identifying and compiling changes in urban areas, gravel pits, and water areas that were not indicated on the publication imagery. Soil lines were adjusted to fit water areas. Soil lines were not adjusted to fit single line streams indicated on the compilation base. Supervision of the recompilation was provided by Soil Conservation Service staff. Actual work was performed by contract with the URI-EDC staff and SCS staff.

Most amendments were made to reduce the number of special soil features where the density of the special features shown in the published survey were not warranted. The special soil features were compiled and digitized, using GRASS software, by NRCS personnel. The NRCS, National Cartography and Geospatial Center, SSURGO Support Section imported both the soils and special soil features data for verification in ARC/INFO 7.0.4. The data were edited.
