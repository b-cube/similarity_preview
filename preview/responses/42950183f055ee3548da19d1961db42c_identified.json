Examples would include Web sites,       HTTP APIs, streaming media, and various flavors of chat.</t>       <t>In this document, \"privacy protection\" means technology whose       deployment increases the cost and difficulty, for anyone but the user and       provider of a data service, of ascertaining who is accessing which       services and what messages are being exchanged between the user and the       service. Obvious examples are encryption and authentication       technologies.</t>        </section>       <section title=\"Privacy-technology arguments\">  <section title=\"Positive and negative failures\">    <t>There are two classes of privacy-related failure in the    operation of data services.    A positive failure occurs when    privacy was provided but was not necessary; a negative failure is    when privacy was not provided, but was necessary for safe or prudent    use of the data service.</t>    <t>The cost of these failure classes is not symmetric; negative    failures can endanger businesses, property, and lives, while    positive failures usually incur at most a little extra expense.</t>  </section>  <section title=\"Free public data\">    <t>It is reasonable to question whether, for freely-available public    data, such as the contents of an online reference work or a    promotional Web site, it makes sense to deploy privacy    protection.</t>     <t>Here are some reasons to answer that question in the    affirmative:    <list style=\"numbers\">            <t>It is very difficult to predict when accessing      information might lead to negative      consequences. For example, some governments criminalize certain      behaviors to the extent that accessing free public reference      documents concerning that behavior could lead to arrest and      prosecution.</t>      <t>If one groups available data services into those which are      non-controversial and thus require no privacy protection, and       those which are controversial and do, some will conclude that      anything with privacy protection must be controversial and thus      subject to suspicion.  This effect is better avoided.      </t>     </list>    </t>  </section>  <section title=\"Making privacy choices\">    <t>Service providers may argue that privacy choices are    best left to the users of their services;    and thus, that opt-in privacy is an appropriate    strategy. </t>    <t>However, the technical and social factors forming the context    for such choices are very complex; even experts often    disagree on privacy requirements.    Thus, the end-users of a data service are likely not    well-equipped to make good choices.</t>    <t>Because of this, and because of the asymmetric costs of positive    and negative privacy failures, it is usually best to remove the    necessity for making these difficult choices, by always providing    the maximum achievable amount of privacy protection.</t>  </section>  <section title=\"Failures of privacy technology\">    <t>Internet privacy technologies are known to be imperfect.    Algorithms have been compromised and there is widespread    dissatisfaction with the PKI infrastructure.</t>    <t>Furthermore, it is widely agreed that an attacker who wishes    to compromise a target\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds privacy has many means, ranging from social    engineering to hardware hacking to zero-day exploits, to bypass    privacy protection.</t>    <t>Therefore, it is reasonable to question the deployment    of privacy protection, which may create an    unrealistic expectation of complete safety when in fact that is not    achievable.</t>    <t>However, this line of argument fails on economic grounds.      Deployments of privacy technology, however imperfect, generally    have the effect of increasing the    cost to an attacker of invading end-users' privacy.  Every time that    cost goes up, certain surveillance activities, whether by    government bodies or criminals, become uneconomic and will be    abandoned, with the effect of globally increasing the security and    privacy of Internet data services.</t>  </section>  <section title=\"Cost of privacy technology\">    <t>Privacy technologies are not free; there are monetary costs for    accessing the PKI infrastructure and bandwidth/computation costs    related to encryption and authentication.    Service providers may find it difficult to justify such expenses,    particularly those who have severe budget constraints.</t>    <t>However, the cost of PKI access,    computation, and bandwidth have historically been declining    monotonically, decreasing the force of this argument with every    passing year. It should also be noted that those who are operating    on low budgets are often providing data services to disadvantaged    groups, who may be in particular need of privacy protection.</t>  </section>       </section>          </middle>    <!--  *****BACK MATTER *****   <back>      <references title=\"Normative References\">       &RFC2119;     </references>    </back> --> </rfc> ",
