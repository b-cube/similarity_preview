The rest of his team shaved their heads in support. <br /><br />Their gesture had a huge impact on Chase and led him to start the Vs. Cancer Foundation. The organization empowers sports teams, from little league to the pros, to raise awareness and money in hopes of ending <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/care-centers-and-clinics/childrens-cancer-hospital/diseases-treatment/index.html\">childhood cancer</a>. <br /><br />Since it started in 2013, Vs. Cancer has raised more than $1.5 million for children's hospitals and cancer research. They've worked with The University of North Carolina, Duke University, Texas A&amp;M University and the Seattle Mariners, among others.<br /><br />\"Every age, every sport, every form -- college, high school, youth -- we've given them the platform to make a difference,\" Chase says. \"As a cancer survivor, I couldn't be more excited about that.\" <br /><b><br />Finding hope during pineal region germinoma treatment </b><br />One day after baseball practice, Chase walked off the field with a sharp headache. It was unlike any pain he'd known before. He never thought it was a <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-types/brain-tumor/symptoms/index.html\">brain tumor symptom</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br />Chase was diagnosed with stage four pineal region germinoma. This type of tumor starts in the center of the brain and had metastasized to his spine. <br /><br />There were few treatment options for him close to home. So, after a series of surgeries, <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/chemotherapy/index.html\">chemotherapy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/index.html\">radiation</a> at a North Carolina hospital, Chase came to the <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/proton-therapy-center/index.html\">MD Anderson Proton Therapy Center</a>.<br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[Despite being far from his friends and family, Chase felt at home right away. <br /><br />\"The greatest feeling was walking in knowing I would walk out cancer-free,\" he says.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>Helping others beat the odds</b><br />Today, Chase is 26, cancer-free and helping athletes help kids with cancer. <br /><br />\"Everybody has been affected by cancer, and athletes have a platform within their communities. They can do so much because of the position they're in,\" Chase says. <br /><br />Through Vs. Cancer, teams are encouraged to host a creative fundraising event. Examples include a head shaving event, 100-inning game, relay race, kickball game, or just adding a yellow ribbon to the jerseys. Then, teams make a donation. <br /><br />\"It's about showing athletes that they can make a difference,\" Chase says. <br /><br />\"I don't know why I survived cancer. I don't know why I defied the odds. But because of that, I will be doing this as long as there are kids battling cancer.\" <br /><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>. </b><br /><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>How CrossFit helped me get in shape after testicular cancer</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/03/how-crossfit-helped-me-get-in-shape-after-testicular-cancer.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3409</id>      <published>2015-03-02T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-05T17:07:39Z</updated>      <summary>After testicular cancer treatment, Shane Scott was overweight and needed to get back in shape.

I played football in high school and college. But after my testicular cancer treatment, I was overweight, and I wasn't leading a healthy lifestyle. I knew I needed to get stronger to prevent my cancer from coming back. <br /><br />CrossFit turned out to be exactly what I needed. It helped me do a lot more than just get back in shape. It helped me find my confidence and connect with others.<br /><b><br />Starting CrossFit after testicular cancer treatment</b><br />My testicular cancer treatment included three cycles of chemotherapy and a surgery. It was tough, but following the surgery, I was declared cancer-free. <br /><br />Two years later, I learned a CrossFit gym would be opening in my hometown. I was so excited.<br /><br />I missed the competitiveness and locker room feel I had known playing football in high school and college. This was going to be how I would become&nbsp; healthy again. The first day I went, I knew I was hooked. My gym is like a big diverse family. We would do anything for each other, inside the gym or out. <br /><br />I know that if I don't take care of my body, it will not take care of me. I have cancer scar tissue in my body, and I need to do everything in my power to strengthen it and build it up so the cancer won't come back.&nbsp; <br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[CrossFit was difficult initially, but I've come a long way since then. I remember my first day. I couldn't do a full range of motion sit-up. But that's all in the past now. Since starting CrossFit I've lost 84 lbs and I've become a CrossFit level one trainer.<br /><br /><b>Inspiring others through CrossFit</b><br />Am I an elite athlete? No, and I probably never will be. But I have fun, and I am in the best shape of my life. After cancer, I knew my life had to change. So, I stepped outside of my comfort zone and made one of the best decisions in my life. <br /><br />Many of my friends from CrossFit didn't know about my cancer journey, but that changed when my gym posted my story on their Facebook page.&nbsp; The outpouring of support I received was amazing. My story provided many with motivation, although that wasn't my intention. I wasn't just a big guy going to the gym to get in shape. I was working out to increase my chances of living a cancer-free life. It's really made both myself and others consider why and how we do things.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before cancer, I, like many other people, just went to the gym because I thought I had to. I wanted to look strong, but I had no other motivation. Now, when I go to the gym, I am going to make my body stronger than anything that could try to take me down again. I look forward to going every single day because I have been blessed with the ability and knowledge to live every day to the fullest.<br /><br />Read more <a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/01/facing-infertility-after-testicular-cancer-treatment.html\">posts by Shane Scott</a><br /><b><br />To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>. </b><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>10 ways to ease stress and anxiety during cancer treatment</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/10-ways-to-ease-stress-and-anxiety-during-cancer-treatment.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3415</id>      <published>2015-02-27T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-27T14:26:31Z</updated>      <summary>Whether you have an upcoming CT scan or are expecting news from your doctor, waiting can cause anxiety, worry and stress.

You might have trouble sleeping or feel impatient with your loved ones. All of this is completely normal. Here at MD Anderson, we call that scanxiety. <br /><br />The good news is <a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2013/02/ct-and-mri-scans-tips.html#more\">there are many ways to deal with scanxiety</a>. To help make the waiting game a little easier, we asked our <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/MDAnderson?business_id=10153002141064911\">Facebook community</a> how they cope with the stress or anxiety before an important scan or appointment. Here's what they had to say: <br /><br /><ul><li><b>Pray.</b> Many of our patients and caregivers said they found comfort in prayer. Because they feel a loss of control, praying allows them do what they can and then let go of those anxious feelings. </li><li><b>Have faith and confidence in your care team.</b> Know that our doctors and the rest of your care team will take care of everything. That's their job.</li><li><b>Listen to your favorite music.</b> Whether you're in the waiting room, in your car or at home or work, music can help you escape from the realities of cancer, or find the strength and determination to face them head-on.</li><li><b>Find humor. </b>Nothing eases tension like laughter. </li></ul>]]>         <![CDATA[<ul><li><b>Keep busy doing something you enjoy. </b>Whether it's shopping, spending time with friends or dining out at a favorite restaurant, having a little fun will help keep your mind off the upcoming appointment. </li><li><b>Exercise.</b> Not only can exercise help you stay healthy and strong, it produces mood-boosting endorphins that may help chase away your worries. Be sure to talk with your doctor before <a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2013/06/exercise-for-cancer-survivors-a-great-way-to-boost-your-health.html\">starting any new exercises</a>, and make sure you choose the exercise that's right for you. &nbsp;</li><li><b>Relax.</b> If you're waiting at MD Anderson, take advantage of some of our <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/care-centers-and-clinics/specialty-and-treatment-centers/integrative-medicine-center/index.html\">Integrative Medicine Center's</a> classes, such as <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/care-centers-and-clinics/specialty-and-treatment-centers/integrative-medicine-center/group-classes/index.html\">yoga or tai chi</a>.

I was 37 years old and had 5-year-old twin boys, one with severe cerebral palsy. Having a child with special needs, my husband and I were no strangers to hospitals and doctors. Despite those experiences, nothing could have prepared us for the words \"you have cancer.\" &nbsp;<br /><br />The next year of my life was one of the most difficult, and as I was soon to learn, one of the most inspiring. For my TNBC treatment, I underwent six months of <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/chemotherapy/index.html\">chemotherapy</a>, a bilateral <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/promise/issues/fall-2012/radiation-and-mastectomy.html\">mastectomy</a>, an oophorectomy and two months of <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/index.html\">radiation therapy</a>. &nbsp;<br /><br />On February 13, 2013, my husband and I heard the three most amazing letters ever recited: &nbsp;<br />\"pCR.\" Pathologic Complete Response. The cancer was gone, and I was officially in remission! &nbsp;<br /><br />We cried, hugged our oncologist, hugged our kids, and embraced each other. We decided at that moment that this was a day worth remembering. The end of my TNBC would mark my cancerversary date. Our own personal pre-Valentine's Day celebration of love and joy. <br /><br /><b>Celebrating my first TNBC cancerversary by climbing Mount Kilimanjaro</b><br />When TNBC cancerversary number one arrived in 2014, we decided to go big. My husband and I joined a team of 16 cancer survivors and like-minded cancer-haters to climb the tallest free-standing mountain in the world, Mount Kilimanjaro. Kili reaches 19,341 feet and rises high above the surrounding plains of Tanzania, Africa. The experience was life-changing. &nbsp;<br />]]>         <![CDATA[We spent a total of eight days on the mountain. Six up, and two down. The first six days were spent hiking slowly towards our goal, at around 5 to 6 miles per day. The slope was gradual until our summit day. Summit Day -- the day we reached the top of the mountain -- was an exhaust-ing and exhilarating 19-hour experience like no other. It began at midnight, with nine hours of steep climbing over 4,000 feet of elevation gain. It culminated with a summit push and 10 more hours of hiking down to a camp 5,000 feet below. The eighth and final day took us back out to the base of the mountain.<br /><br />Words will never be able to describe the experience and view standing on the summit. However, the true peak of our climb was the camaraderie. The 16 of us came together as a team. We helped each other through exhaustion, discomfort, altitude sickness and pain. We encouraged each other to keep moving forward, one foot in front of the other, even when it felt like we couldn't take another step. When one person's load got too heavy, we spread his or her supplies among the rest of us, so the person struggling could hike without the extra weight. We kept each other laughing and we worked together to get each and every one of us to the top. In many ways, the climb was a perfect analogy for the cancer journey. I could not have imagined a better way to celebrate my first year cancer-free.<br /><br /><b>Running a marathon in honor of my second TNBC cancerversary</b><br />As my second cancerversary approached this year, my husband and I once again searched for a goal that seemed out of reach. We eventually settled on the idea of attempting our first mara-thon at Disney World in Orlando. <br /><br />We prepared for months, devoted many weekends to long runs and hobbled around on sore legs as evidence of our effort. While it was hard, we once again felt empowered when we achieved our goal. Crossing that finish line released a flood of emotion and remembrance. It was determination and effort, followed by sheer joy. We experienced discomfort and suffering, but the ability to push through that adversity was affirming in so many ways. Celebrating this success with our family at Disney World made the entire experience that much sweeter.<br /><br />So, why are cancerversaries important? For me, it's a way to celebrate life and the strength of the human spirit. It's a time to remember the lessons I've learned from cancer. To appreciate each moment as a gift. <br /><br />My team of doctors at MD Anderson saved my life, and I have no intention of wasting it. That is why I will always celebrate February 13 as a reminder of how fortunate I am. How grateful I am, for another year of this amazing life. &nbsp;<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/MT/mt-search.cgi?search=bree+sandlin&amp;IncludeBlogs=6&amp;limit=20\">Read more about Bree Sandlin.</a><br /><i><br />Triple-negative breast cancer is one of the cancers MD Anderson is focusing on as part of our Moon Shots Program to dramatically reduce cancer deaths. <a href=\"http://www.cancermoonshots.org/cancer-types/breast/\">Learn more about our Breast and Ovarian Moon Shot</a>.</i><br /><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>How my cancer journey became my family&apos;s cancer journey</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/how-my-cancer-journey-became-my-family-cancer-journey.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3408</id>      <published>2015-02-25T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-25T14:11:58Z</updated>      <summary>Jaymee Fiskum wasn&apos;t the only facing an ALCL diagnosis in May 2013.

My entire family took on my cancer journey as if it was their own. <br /><br />Because of them, I consider myself lucky -- as weird as it may sound. I have so much support in my life. It motivated me to fight harder. I couldn't let myself down, but I couldn't let all of them down either. <br /><br /><b>How my family helped me cope with ALCL</b><br />Each one of my family members played a huge part in my cancer journey. <br /><br />After my doctor told me I had ALCL. In September 2013, I began six cycles of <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/chemotherapy/index.html\">chemotherapy</a>, followed by a <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/stem-cell-transplantation/index.html\">stem cell transplant</a>. I was very fortunate enough to have my sister as my donor. Who would've thought letting her borrow my clothes all those years would pay off? <br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[My dad quit his job to be by my side every step of the way. He actually has continued to stick with me during my recovery, too. My mom held the family together financially, keeping her job so we would have the best insurance. My boyfriend, who was about to graduate college, left school to stay with me during my treatment.<br /><br />My boyfriend's aunt, who lives in Houston, let us stay at her house while I was undergoing ALCL treatment at MD Anderson. And both my family and my boyfriend's family helped with fundraising. Even my family members living in Norway made things to sell so that we would have extra money.&nbsp; <br /><b><br />Life after ALCL</b><br />I am still in recovery -- and my family and boyfriend are, too. We're all trying to get used to the new normal and adjust to our new lives. My cancer journey didn't just change me. It changed all of us. We're all more grateful for each other. We've all seen what matters most. <br /><br />I can't stress how important \"mind over matter\" was for me during my journey. No matter how scared I was, I told myself it would be OK. I ultimately believe this happened to me so that someday I can help others. &nbsp;<br /><br />Cancer has taught me that you can't always control your life, and that even though you may have a plan, it may not always happen. But the most important thing it's taught me is to cherish the people who love you and love them with all your heart. <br /><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>How our Suspicion of Cancer Clinic helps patients</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/how-our-suspicion-of-cancer-clinic-helps-patients.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3406</id>      <published>2015-02-24T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-24T15:24:57Z</updated>      <summary>Mary Ann Weiser Suspicion of Cancer Clinic was created in 2001 and  named for a former MD Anderson doctor who wanted to focus on detecting cancer at its earliest stages.</summary>     <author>         <name>Cancerwise Blogger</name>              </author>              <category term=\"Cancer Treatment\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"Patient Care\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"Screening\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"support\" label=\"Support\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />             <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/\">         <![CDATA[<span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"Cancer_Detection_202.jpg\" src=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/Cancer_Detection_202.jpg\" class=\"mt-image-right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;\" width=\"400\" /></span>By Angela Young<br /><br />When Samuel Loftin's blood work showed an unusual level of liver enzymes,&nbsp; a gastroenterologist near his Alabama home recommended an <a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2014/12/what-to-expect-when-you-get-an-ultrasound.html\">ultrasound</a> of his liver. When that test was negative, the doctor ordered an MRI, which showed two suspicious liver lesions, as well as an abnormality in his spine. Samuel's doctor said it was probably cancer and that spots on his spine meant it might have spread to his vertebrae. Samuel was referred to a nearby cancer center.<br /><br />\"My doctor set up the appointment, but it was three weeks away. I just couldn't wait that long,\" Samuel says.<br /><br />He called MD Anderson and got an appointment right away at the <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/care-centers-and-clinics/specialty-and-treatment-centers/internal-medicine-center/services-and-facilities/suspicion-of-cancer-program.html\">Mary Ann Weiser Suspicion of Cancer Clinic</a>. Created in 2001, the clinic is named for a former MD Anderson doctor who wanted to focus on detecting cancer at its earliest stages. Weiser always was looking for a challenge, according to colleagues.<br /><br />\"When patients try to come here without a clear diagnosis, it can be difficult for them to come in the front door,\" says <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/John_Patlan/Default.asp\">John Patlan, M.D.</a>, in General Internal Medicine. \"Dr. Weiser's goal was to make it easier for them.\"<br /><br />After Weiser died in 2006, Patlan took over leadership of the clinic. Two years ago, the clinic received additional funding, and now it has a dedicated workspace in the Internal Medicine Center and a second doctor, <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/MichaelArden_Perdon/Default.asp?SNID=0\">Michael Perdon, M.D.</a>, in General Internal Medicine.<div><br />Patlan works in the clinic three days a week, and Perdon takes over on the other two days. Veronica Smith, a nurse practitioner, works full-time, and Maura Polansky, a physician assistant, works in the clinic one morning a week. Together, the team sees 15 to 20 concerned, but hopeful, new patients each week.<br /><br />Patlan estimates they spend three or four hours with each patient beyond the initial one-hour clinic visit. That includes coordination of multiple diagnostic studies and phone calls to the patient and to other doctors.<br /><br /><b>Next-day appointments for Houston patients</b><br />Often, patients who live in the Houston area are surprised they can get an appointment at the Suspicion of Cancer Clinic the day after they call. When they arrive for their first appointment, Smith, the nurse practitioner&nbsp; is usually the first provider they see, and they share their fears with her.<br /><br />\"Dealing with the unknown causes them so much anxiety,\" Smith says. \"Some patients say they feel better even if they find out they do have cancer.\"<br /> </div>]]>         <![CDATA[About 70% to 75% of the Suspicion of Cancer Clinic's patients discover they do indeed have cancer. <br /><br />For those patients, the doctors complete the staging of their disease and refer them to surgeons or oncologists.<br /><br />\"We're the first faces that they see here,\" Patlan says. \"And we try to make this as positive and supportive an experience as we can.\"<br /><br />Sometimes, the care team gets to deliver good news.<br /><br />That was the case with Samuel. The last test he was scheduled to have was a biopsy on his back. But on the day of his appointment, he received a call telling him to come back to the clinic and talk to the doctor first.<br /><br />That's when he got the news that he had only benign areas in his liver, and an old vertebral fracture. There was no cancer in the vertabra or the liver. Samuel was both surprised and grateful to get such good news.<br /><i><br />A longer version of this story originally appeared in Messenger, MD Anderson's bimonthly employee publication.</i><br /><b><br />To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>Why I vaccinate my sons against HPV </title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/why-i-vaccinate-my-sons-against-hpv.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3405</id>      <published>2015-02-23T13:35:55Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-23T14:56:07Z</updated>      <summary>As a cervical cancer survivor, Linda Ryan has tried to protect her two sons from cancer.

I didn't want them to feel the emotional effects of my own cancer journey, and I certainly don't want them to go what I went through.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />When it comes to <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/prevention-and-screening/index.html\">cancer prevention</a>, there is something I can do now to reduce their chances of being diagnosed with certain cancers in the future: <a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2013/06/hpv-vaccine-a-smart-way-to-protect-kids-from-cancer.html\">Vaccinate</a> against the human papillomavirus (HPV), which can cause several types of cancer. That includes cervical cancer, as well as head and neck cancers, anal cancer, vulvar cancer and rare genital cancers.<br /><br /><b>What the HPV vaccine prevents</b><br />I know the phrase \"<a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2013/06/hpv-vaccine-a-smart-way-to-protect-kids-from-cancer.html\">HPV vaccine</a>\" can conjure up negative connotations, but the words \"cancer\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/chemotherapy/index.html\">chemotherapy</a>\" are much worse in my book. <br /><br />Most people don't consider chemo easy or fun. For me, the side effects were painful. When I was undergoing cervical cancer treatment, I didn't have a port, so I received my chemotherapy through an IV. My infusions were close to nine hours long. Some of the medicines and hydration irritated my veins and caused pain that needed to be managed with heat, cold, and eventually, medicine. The pain often brought me to tears.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Had I been given the chance to be vaccinated 30 years ago vs. having a hysterectomy, eight rounds of chemotherapy and live with the worry that I may not see my children grow up, I know what I would have chosen. And, it's what I chose for my two sons. <br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[Yes, sons. Females aren't the only ones who get HPV-related cancers. It's true that 99% of <a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2013/01/cervical-cancer-what-you-need-to-know.html\">cervical cancer cases are related to HPV</a>. But HPV also puts males and females alike at risk for head and neck cancers, anal cancer and genital cancers. I don't want my kids to go through what I went through, and I don't want my future grandchildren to go through what my kids went through when I was undergoing cancer treatment. <br /><br />My children lost their mom for several months. They were in the eighth and fourth grades at the time. When my treatment began, I was unable to attend any field trips or help in the classroom. I even missed their school Christmas program. Not only did I miss a year of their lives; they missed a year of having a mom be involved in theirs. That is time that cannot be replaced.&nbsp; <br /><b><br />Improving my kids' lives any way I can</b><br />So, as a mom and a cancer survivor, I tell other parents: don't wait to get your kids the HPV vaccine. Though your children can get the HPV vaccine up to age 26, the vaccine is most effective if they get it around age 11 or 12. That's when their immune systems respond best to the vaccine. Vaccinating my sons so they don't have to tell their children they have cancer like I did seems like an easy decision to me.<br /><br />My older son has been vaccinated, and my younger son will get the vaccine at his next checkup. While no child likes to get a shot, let alone the three required for the HPV vaccine, I tell my boys it's better than getting nine painful hours of chemotherapy repeatedly. <br />&nbsp; <br /><i>Linda Ryan thought she had checked cancer off her list.

I thought he'd be bedridden for the rest of his life.\"<br />But thanks to physical therapy, Russell's grandfather regained his independence.<br /><br />\"He'd go from riding his power chair or golf cart to mowing the lawn on his four-wheeler. He lived another eight years and had very good quality of life,\" she says.<br /><br />When she saw the impact physical therapy can have on a patient, she decided to become a physical therapist.<br /><b><br />Preparing for a career at MD Anderson</b><br />After earning a bachelor of science in Kinesiology at the University of North Texas in Denton and spending \"three years of blizzards\" completing a doctorate in physical therapy near Chicago, Russell returned to Texas. She was finishing her final physical therapy rotation at another Houston hospital when something caught her eye.<br /><br />\"I was driving around the medical center and noticed MD Anderson's buildings,\" she recalls.<br />\"And I thought, 'What an incredible place that would be to work.' \"<br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[That dream became reality in August 2013, when Russell joined our <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/care-centers-and-clinics/clinics/rehabilitation-services/index.html\">Rehabilitation Services</a> department.<br /><br /><b>Helping our cancer patients</b><br />She's found that people sometimes are surprised to see physical therapists at a cancer center. But Russell and her colleagues play crucial roles in helping patients manage issues related to cancer and its treatment.<br /><br />\"I like to say we're engineers of the body. We do many different things to help improve patients' quality of life,\" she says.<br /><br />For example, Russell helps patients manage side effects like <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/dealing-with-cancer-treatment/lymphedema/index.html\">lymphedema</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/dealing-with-cancer-treatment/fatigue/index.html\">fatigue</a>. And she's especially interested in pelvic floor rehabilitation.<br /><br />\"<a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/index.html\">Radiation</a> can cause tightness in the pelvic muscles that can lead to problems like incontinence, pain and sexual dysfunction in both men and women,\" she explains.<br /><br />\"I learned about this when I worked with an amazing pelvic floor therapist in school. It's not everyone's forte, but I'm fascinated by it.\"<br /><br />When Russell interviewed here, she asked about our pelvic floor therapy program. When she found out we didn't have one, she decided to start a program herself. Right now it has a staff of just two: Russell and a physical therapist at <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/radiation/index.html\">our Katy location</a>. But she wants to complete her own training in this field and continue to build our program.<br /><br /><b>Transformed by a wig</b><br />Russell, who grew up doing theater, recently decided she had another goal: to get back on the stage.<br /><br />After investigating upcoming community theater productions, she auditioned for the play \"Grease.\"<br /><br />Russell was thrilled to get the part as Rizzo. Then came the challenge of going from physical therapist by day to tough, sarcastic Rizzo at night.<br /><br />\"I'd done lots of musicals, but I'd never played a part like this. The closest thing was when I was a girl in a can-can line in high school,\" she says.<br /><br />But Russell and her castmates soon made an interesting discovery.<br /><br />\"We decided that when I put on the black wig, I turned into Rizzo,\" she laughs.<br /><br />Russell spent an exhausting month working here every day, picking up her 11-year-old daughter, Chloe, from school, and then driving to the theater for rehearsals and productions. <br /><br />But she loved the experience and hopes to audition for another play in the future. <br /><br />For now, Russell's happy to share her joy of performing at work.<br /><br />\"I love to sing and dance with my patients, and I'll round up some of my co-workers, too,\" she says. \"Our <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/conquest/issues/2011-spring/radiation-bells.html\">patients ring a bell</a> when they complete treatment, just like they do in Radiation. <br />So we have a big celebration.\"<br /><br /><i>A longer version of this story originally appeared in Messenger, MD Anderson's bimonthly employee publication.<br /></i><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br /><b><br />Related</b><br /><a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/cancer-newsline/cancer-newsline-topics/2010/cancer-newsline-physical-therapy-for-cancer-patients.html\">Physical therapy for cancer patients</a><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>Getting to know our head of clinical operations, Bob Brigham</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/getting-to-know-our-head-of-clinical-operations-bob-brigham.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3400</id>      <published>2015-02-19T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-19T20:01:08Z</updated>      <summary>Bob Brigham, our new senior vice president for Hospital and Clinics, is excited about his new role -- and supporting our mission to end cancer.</summary>     <author>         <name>Cancerwise Blogger</name>              </author>              <category term=\"Support\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"support\" label=\"Support\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />             <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/\">         <![CDATA[<span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"bobbrigham217.jpg\" src=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/bobbrigham217.jpg\" class=\"mt-image-right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;\" width=\"200\" /></span>By Lindsay Lewis<br /><br />Last month, MD Anderson gained a new leader for our inpatient and outpatient clinical operations. Bob Brigham, our new senior vice president for Hospital and Clinics, is excited about his new role -- and supporting our mission to end cancer.<br /><br />We recently spoke with Brigham to learn more about him and his plans for improving our patients' experiences at MD Anderson. Here's what he had to say:<br /><br /><b>What experience do you bring?</b><br />I worked at the Mayo Clinic for 36 years. My career path there afforded me the opportunity to develop a diverse set of health care experiences. After starting as a staff nurse, I moved through a number of roles, including nurse manager, operating room director and nursing director, as well as clinic and hospital administration. I worked with patients and staff in many clinical and administrative areas. From 2005 until I started here, I was chief administrative officer and chair of administration at the Jacksonville, Florida, campus, leading Mayo's patient care and non-patient care operations in the southeast.<br /><b><br />What inspired you to enter nursing?</b><br />When I was in college, my interests and skills leaned toward careers in health care. I was fortunate to have a radiologist friend who was willing to let me spend a January term with him. I saw firsthand many of the different roles within health care. I particularly resonated with one person who was passionate about life, his family and the work he did every day as a nurse. That career hadn't occurred to me, given the few men in nursing in the 1970s, but the thought of entering the field and doing something different excited me.<br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[<b>What motivates you most about MD Anderson?</b><br /><a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/about-us/index.html\">The focus on MD Anderson's mission</a> -- everyone has passion for it and is excited about the work they do. It's great to see the entire organization put the patient at the center of everything. It's not hard to want to be a part of that.<br /><br /><b>What do you plan to do first?</b><br />Become part of the team. MD Anderson has a rich history, with an emphasis on service, growth and excellence in our campuses, network, patient operations and advancement of the science to end cancer. There's a lot to learn here, so my first goal is to learn about our patients.<br /><b><br />What's been your biggest challenge so far?</b><br />Learning my way around the campus and the city! My gosh, Houston and MD Anderson are huge. It'll definitely take me some time to adjust.<br /><br /><b>What was the best advice you've received about MD Anderson?</b><br />If given an opportunity to work there, by all means, take it.<br /><b><br />As a child, what did you want to be when you grew up?</b><br />Like many little boys, I wanted to be a firefighter. My first grade field trip was to a fire station, so from early on, that's what I, and many of my buddies, dreamed about doing.<br /><br /><b>What do you do for fun?</b><br />I'm from the Midwest and like the outdoors. I like to hunt, fish, kayak and take photographs. In fact, the belt I'm wearing is the product of a Florida gator hunt. I look forward to new opportunities for experiencing the outdoors in Texas. I like to play golf, but I'm not particularly good at it. On the upside, I enjoy a lower cost per stroke than most of the people I play with.<br /><b><br />What's a fun fact about you?</b><br />I played football for John Gagliardi at St. John's University in Collegeville, Minnesota.

I received my initial diagnosis three years ago. I went to a surgeon, they got clean lines and I followed up with my dermatologist. So whew, crisis averted. <br /><br /><b>My melanoma recurrence </b><br />In June 2014, I first noticed a lump under my left arm. I had just completed a 30-day yoga challenge, so I figured all the sweating had led to a blocked lymph node. My husband, the worrier, insisted I see a doctor.<br /><br />I didn't even have a primary care doctor at the time, so scheduling an appointment was a challenge. I heard a lot of \"We're not taking any new patients,\" or \"Give it a few weeks.\" <br /><br />My husband wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. So, my sister, a nursing student at the time, got me into the school clinic for an ultrasound and eventually a biopsy. The results came back positive for melanoma.&nbsp; <br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[We scheduled an appointment with MD Anderson for more scans, which showed that the melanoma was concentrated in my left arm and hadn't spread. Whew. Crisis averted again. <br /><br /><b>Coming to MD Anderson for melanoma treatment</b><br />About a week after the scans, I had approximately 40 lymph nodes removed. The biopsy results showed that 10 were positive for melanoma. Some had burst and the melanoma was oozing into the space. So they had to use liposuction to remove the extra tainted fat.&nbsp; I also got to wear a drain for about three weeks. I put googly eyes on it so it would look back at people looking at it.&nbsp; <br /><br />During my recovery, I developed a cough. \"Totally normal due to inactivity,\" I was told. But when I still had the cough a month after surgery, my oncologist, <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/Rodabe_Amaria/Default.asp?SNID=2\">Rodabe Amaria, M.D.</a>, sent me for a chest X-ray. Turns out my lungs were filled with tiny little tumors. <br /><br />My treatment plan changed from 12 weeks of biochemotherapy and radiation, to five pills a day, each day for three months. Needless to say, I was thrilled! I wouldn't have to take time off work and didn't have to inject myself or have a pic line placed. And very few people experienced side effects from this oral chemo. Even better!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><b><br />Coping with oral chemo side effects</b><br />About two weeks later, I was at a work conference, and as conferences go, I figured it had just given me a migraine. I was nauseous, my head was pounding, and I was shivering uncontrollably. I was so nonchalant about having cancer that I didn't even think to blame my medications.&nbsp; <br /><br />Turns out, I should have. I spent the next four months trying different doses, different times to take the pills, with food/without food. I ended up in the hospital for about four days because my body was not tolerating this cocktail. &nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Finding my confidence through cancer </b><br />From the beginning, I refused to allow the night sweats, vomiting, and fever/chills, stop me from living my life. I was sent home from work more often than I called in sick. Often, I dragged myself off the bathroom floor, got dressed, and sometimes put my makeup on while I lay on the floor. <br /><br />At my most sick, I I got tired of looking for a hair tie or bobby pins while running to the bathroom to vomit. So, I cut off all of my hair. This was a real turning point for me. Before I'd gotten sick, I had seen all the celebrities rocking a pixie cut, and I'd wanted to try it. But I didn't know if I had the confidence, or head shape, to pull it off.&nbsp; <br /><br />Fortunately, cancer taught me that if you've got the confidence, you can rock anything. And, that's what's inspiring me to be bolder. I'm not trying to cross everything off my bucket list. All I'm trying to do is seize those moments when I would have said \"maybe next time\" and make it \"OK, this time.\"&nbsp; <br /><br />Read more about Kate on <a href=\"http://katesfight.com/blog/\">her blog</a>.<br /><i><br />Melanoma is one of the cancers MD Anderson is focusing on as part of our Moon Shots Program to dramatically reduce cancer deaths. <a href=\"http://www.cancermoonshots.org/moon-shots/melanoma/\">Learn more about our Melanoma Moon Shot</a>. </i><br /><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>. </b><br /><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>How we&apos;re changing - with help from our patients </title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/how-were-changing-with-help-from-our-patients.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3398</id>      <published>2015-02-17T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-18T14:39:51Z</updated>      <summary>Five years ago, Gary Bentz came to MD Anderson to complete his cancer treatment.

His cancer was stage 4.<br /><br />Today, Bentz -- who's cancer-free -- is back at MD Anderson, but for a much different reason. He's one of 28 patient advisors who are volunteering their time to help us shape policies and programs to improve the patient experience. <br /><br /><b>Why we need patient feedback and involvement</b><br />Bentz and the other members of our <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/how-you-can-help/other-ways-to-help/pfac/index.html\">Patient and Family Advisory Council </a>come to MD Anderson at least once a month to share stories and provide feedback on issues impacting our patients.<br /><br />And, many of them now serve on committees that previously only included our employees. <br /><br />\"Having a patient at the table with us is very powerful,\" says John Bingham, vice president for Performance Improvement. His Patient Safety Committee was one of the first to request patient involvement. \"It'll accelerate our efforts to keep our patients safer.\"<br /> ]]>         <![CDATA[When Bingham and his team reached out for patient involvement, they knew what they were looking for.<br /><br />\"We needed someone who's reflective, transparent and honest,\" he says. \"And we needed a patient who's willing to tell us what we need to hear.\"<br /><b><br />A fresh perspective</b><br />Bentz was approached as a possible candidate to serve on the Patient Safety Committee, partly due to his more than 40 years of experience as an engineer.<br /><br />\"There's a richness in Gary's story, particularly because he's from the energy industry,\" Bingham says. \"There's a lot we can learn from other industries when it comes to safety issues. We want his voice as part of our conversation.\"<br /><br />With more than 40 years of experience as a petroleum engineer and owner of an independent oil company, Bentz knows a thing or two about safety.<br /><br />\"We spend a lot of time dissecting problems to create a safer environment for our operations,\" he explains.<br /><br />Bentz will use that expertise, coupled with his personal experience at MD Anderson, to help the committee find creative solutions to some of the greatest challenges in health care today, such as keeping patients safe and being at the forefront of delivery systems built on information technology.<br /><br />For Bentz, participation on the Patient Advisory Committee is an opportunity to pay back MD Anderson for all it's done for him.<br /><br />\"MD Anderson saved my life,\" he says. \"My 3-year-old grandson and 2-year-old granddaughter may have never known their PawPaw.

Inspired by his family's experiences, he does his best to make our patients feel welcome. You often can find him handing out warm blankets and coffee, and when he has time, strumming on his ukulele.<br /><br />\"I remember my family saying how they appreciated it when a hospital felt more like a home,\" he says. \"I just want to do my best to brighten patients' days and let them know I'm here for them.\"<br /><b><br />The backbone of MD Anderson</b><br />Patient services coordinators balance requests from the entire care team, patients and family members.<br /><br />\"They're the backbone of MD Anderson in a lot of ways,\" says Elizabeth Lottinger, a Human Resources consultant. \"They often set the stage for what the patient experience is going to be.\"<br /><br />Their responsibilities vary depending upon where they work at MD Anderson. Their duties can include scheduling appointments; entering doctors' orders for medications, tests and procedures; answering patients' scheduling questions submitted to our <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/contact-us/askmdanderson/index.html\">health information specialists</a>; and responding to non-medical requests. <br /><br />Often compared to jugglers and air traffic controllers, our patient services coordinators help keep the flow of a clinic or center in check while also directing our employees and our supplies where they need to be.<br /><br />Scheduling appointments is far more complex than it seems, Neicy Leonard shares.

And certain scans, tests and procedures must occur in a particular sequence, often prior to a patient seeing a doctor.<br /><br />\"It can be a challenge sometimes,\" Leonard says. \"You have to have a strategy and be able to prioritize requests.\"<br /><br />To add to the complexity of scheduling, a patient's availability often depends on outside factors, like his or her work schedule, ability to find child care, transportation and insurance clearance.<br /><br />\"It can be a stressful and painful time,\" says Cynthia Barbour, who works in our Head and Neck Center. \"It's important to let patients know that their care is a priority and that we'll make every effort to coordinate their appointments in an attempt to ease some of the anxiety they may be experiencing.\"<br /><br />Barbour and our other patient services coordinators try to accommodate patients' requests for appointments, and often they give patients their direct phone numbers to be more easily accessible. They also identify opportunities that will allow patients to spend less time here, like rescheduling a morning appointment closer to an afternoon one.<br /><br />\"You have to try to do all you can to make it easier on the patient,\" Barbour says. \"When patients say thank you for helping them out, that's the best feeling.\"<br /><br /><b>A common focus</b><br />While the roughly 600 patient services coordinators spread out among our centers and clinics have varied roles, they all share a common focus: our patients and their families.<br /><br />Josh Becerra in Nursing P8 is accustomed to receiving a host of different questions from patients and family members. Whether they're looking for the cafeteria or a copy of their bloodwork, Becerra has the answers or can find someone who does.<br /><br />He also enjoys listening to patients and being a sounding board.<br /><br />\"I've met a lot of interesting people from all over the world,\" he says. \"From rocket scientists to ranchers, they're all just looking for somebody to talk to or provide support.\"<br /><br />Leonard supports our patients even when they've left MD Anderson.<br /><br />\"I like to send Christmas cards to patients who live by themselves or periodically call to check in on ones who have been going through a hard time,\" she says. \"I can tell that hearing from someone who cares about them lifts their spirits.\"<br /><br />Watch this video to learn more about our patient services coordinators: <br /><br /> <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cF2vERsWATg\" allowfullscreen=\"\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe> <br /><i>This story originally appeared in Messenger, MD Anderson's bimonthly employee publication.</i><br /><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br /><br /><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>What a Houston breast cancer survivor learned from her family</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/what-a-houston-breast-cancer-survivor-learned-from-her-family.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3395</id>      <published>2015-02-12T14:39:28Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-13T19:37:27Z</updated>      <summary>When Barbara Kielaszek was diagnosed with breast cancer, she knew right away she was going to stay close to home.

Sadly, my grandmother waited too long to see a doctor. Even though she had a double <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/publications/promise/issues/fall-2012/radiation-and-mastectomy.html\">mastectomy</a> and showed her courageous spirit during her cancer journey, the cancer had spread and my grandmother died within a few years.&nbsp; <br /><br />About the same time my grandmother received her breast cancer diagnosis, my mom found a lump that turned out to be breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy of her left breast. Ten years later, Mom found a lump in her right breast followed by another mastectomy. It's been 30 years since Mom's second mastectomy -- and she's been cancer-free ever since then. <br />&nbsp;<br />When I received my own breast cancer diagnosis at the age of 55 I had two examples of tremendous heart, spirit and courage to follow. For me, that made all the difference. <br /><br /><b>My breast cancer diagnosis</b><br />I started getting annual mammograms after my mom received her second diagnosis. Each year, I almost expected to hear the words, \"You have cancer.\" <br /><br />That phone call finally came in June 2013. I had infiltrating ductal carcinoma.&nbsp;]]>         <![CDATA[I never experienced denial or anger, although I feared what my diagnosis meant for my two daughters. My main worry was that my daughters might be the fourth generation in the line of breast cancer.&nbsp; <br /><br />I quickly scheduled an appointment at MD Anderson in the <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/care-centers-and-clinics/care-centers/breast/index.html\">Nellie B. Connally Breast Center's Multi Team Clinic</a>. That's where both my doctor and I had always planned for me to go if I was diagnosed with breast cancer. <br /><br />I chose MD Anderson because of its reputation. The location, in my hometown of Houston, was a bonus. I got to go home every day. I continued to work. I could get my radiation treatments during my lunch break.<br /><b><br />Coming to MD Anderson</b><br />On July 5, I had my first appointment with my team at MD Anderson -my oncologist, <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/CarlosHernando_Barcenas/Default.asp\">Carlos Barcenas, M.D</a>.; my radiation oncologist, <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/Benjamin_Smith/Default.asp\">Benjamin Smith, M.D.</a>; and my surgeon, <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/Isabelle_Bedrosian/\">Isabelle Bedrosian, M.D</a>. <br /><br />During my appointment, I met with my three doctors together as a group, as well as one-on-one so that I could better understand their role in my care. They left for a short time to talk together. It was reassuring to know that the three doctors actually met face-to-face to discuss their recommendations for me.&nbsp; <br /><br />Together, we developed my breast cancer treatment plan -- a <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-types/breast-cancer/treatment/index.html\">lumpectomy</a>, <b><a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/prevention-and-screening/screening/genetic-testing.html\">genetic testing</a></b> and radiation therapy. <br /><br /><b>My breast cancer treatment</b><br />My lumpectomy was two weeks after I met with my doctors. The surgery went well, and I was resting at home later that afternoon.&nbsp; <br /><br />About a month later, on August 2nd, later, I underwent genetic testing to see if I carried the BRCA mutation, which puts carriers at increased risk for breast cancer and ovarian cancer. I knew that if I tested positive, my daughters also may be more likely to develop cancer. Waiting for these results was one of the hardest parts of having breast cancer. Luckily, I learned that I don't carry the BRCA genetic mutation.&nbsp; <br /><br />After the genetic testing, I started my four weeks of radiation therapy on a clinical trial with Dr. Smith. When I sat in the women's waiting area before my radiation treatments, I loved reading the notes and cards left by other women who had finished treatment. It also was encouraging to talk to other women who were waiting for their treatments.<br /><br />Everyone I met at MD Anderson was kind, reassuring and uplifting. The staff helped me see my radiation markings as \"war paint\" and soothed the burns brought by treatment.<br /><b><br />Participating in a clinical trial to avoid breast cancer recurrence</b><br />About 10 months after completing radiation, I was invited to participate in a study with <a href=\"http://faculty.mdanderson.org/Elizabeth_Mittendorf/\">Elizabeth Mittendorf, M.D.</a>&nbsp; I'm so glad to be a part of this study which will hopefully lead to a new treatment protocol that will use a vaccine to protect women like me from breast cancer recurrence.<br /><br />Thanks to everyone at MD Anderson and to my family's love and support, I was able to make cancer history for myself -- and hopefully for other women in the future, too.<br /><b><br />To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"https://www4.mdanderson.org/contact/selfreferral/\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br /><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>What I&apos;d like to tell my pre-cancer self</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/what-id-like-to-tell-my-pre-cancer-self.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3393</id>      <published>2015-02-11T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-11T20:11:16Z</updated>      <summary>Stephanie Madsen decided to write a letter to herself just before she was diagnosed with large cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer. </summary>     <author>         <name>Cancerwise Blogger</name>              </author>              <category term=\"Cancer Patient Stories\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"cervicalcancer\" label=\"Cervical Cancer\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />             <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/\">         <![CDATA[<span class=\"mt-enclosure mt-enclosure-image\" style=\"display: inline;\"><img alt=\"smbefore.jpg\" src=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/smbefore.jpg\" class=\"mt-image-right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;\" width=\"300\" /></span>By Stephanie Madsen<br /><br /><i>As I completed my last round of <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-topics/cancer-treatment/chemotherapy/index.html\">chemotherapy</a> a few weeks ago, I thought back to the woman I was before cancer. Looking back at how much life has changed -- and how much I've changed -- I decided to write a letter to myself just before I was diagnosed with <a href=\"http://www.mdanderson.org/patient-and-cancer-information/cancer-information/cancer-types/cervical-cancer/small-and-large-cell.html\">large cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer</a>.</i><br /><br />Dear Stephanie of January 2012,<br /><br />On January 25, 2012, you will be diagnosed with cancer. And three years later -- almost to the day -- you will finish chemo treatment and be on a new journey. Be encouraged. Those three years will be some of the hardest years of your life, but they'll shape you in ways no other experience could. Be grateful.<br /><br />You are both stronger and weaker than you could ever imagine. Life is about to show you that. <br />Here's what I want you to know about yourself now -- before cancer -- and what's to come.<br /><br /><b>Stay ready.</b> You are young, healthy, vibrant, and full of energy and dreams. You are working hard and enjoy your job. You have married the love of your life and are thrilled to come home to him every day. This truly feels like the beginning of an incredible journey, and you and your husband feel ready to conquer anything. Ready for whatever the future has in store for you. You think that means a white picket fence and two children. You feel ready for a reason, but it's not the reason you think. Stay ready.<br /> <script id=\"hiddenlpsubmitdiv\" style=\"display: none;\"></script><script>try{for(var lastpass_iter=0; lastpass_iter < document.forms.length; lastpass_iter++){ var lastpass_f = document.forms[lastpass_iter]; if(typeof(lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2)==\"undefined\"){ lastpass_f.lpsubmitorig2 = lastpass_f.submit; lastpass_f.submit = function(){ var form=this; var customEvent = document.createEvent(\"Event\"); customEvent.initEvent(\"lpCustomEvent\", true, true); var d = document.getElementById(\"hiddenlpsubmitdiv\"); if (d) {for(var i = 0; i < document.forms.length; i++){ if(document.forms[i]==form){ if (typeof(d.innerText) != 'undefined') { d.innerText=i; } else { d.textContent=i; } } } d.dispatchEvent(customEvent); }form.lpsubmitorig2(); } } }}catch(e){}</script>]]>         <![CDATA[<b>Think about who you want to be. </b>I know how much you love it. Go on with your blonde self -- enjoy it. You are in shape and look good. You don't believe it, but you are perfectly beautiful as you are. Stop worrying so much about it. Soon you will find that when looks fade, character will remain. Start thinking about your identity.<br /><br /><b>Your husband adores you. </b>You think you have an understanding of his love and commitment, but you really have no clue yet. You both laugh at the words of friends who married before you: \"The first year is the hardest.\" You say to each other, \"If the first year is the hardest, we'll be smooth sailing for the rest of our lives because this is easy!\" <br /><br />You were right: the first year was easy. Things will get harder. The man who stands by your side now will stand by your side through your darkest times. He meant every single word of his vows to you. Cherish him.<br /><br /><b>Go with the flow.</b> You like plans, goals and lists. You struggle with control. You want things just right. Let your pride take a step back. Though you have perfected the plans of your life story, be ready for something different. It's OK to go with the flow. Be open to new things. Surrendering the life and all of the plans you blueprinted is scary, but marvelous.<br /><b><br />You have experienced pain and loss, but you don't fully know grief.</b> It's bitter and refreshing all at once. It comes swiftly and unexpectedly, but can truly heal if you let it. Though you are emotional at times, crying will soon become second nature. It doesn't mean that you are weak. In tears, there is strength. Allow yourself to experience the pain and then work through it. Don't avoid situations because they make you uncomfortable. Dive in.<br /><br /><b>You have a story.</b> The life you live now will soon change to reveal your purpose. The woman you are now will be pruned in order for a new creation to spring forth. At times, you won't recognize the woman you see in the mirror, but she is still there, stronger than before. Though there will be days and even months of painful struggle, the reward for staying steadfast will overwhelm you. Don't give up. Keep your eyes focused on what matters most. <br /><br />You are brave. You are strong. You are fierce. You are a warrior. You are a fighter. You have the tools you need. You can do this. I believe in you.<br /><br />With utmost expectations and encouragement,<br /><br />Stephanie of January 2015<br /><i><br /><a href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/MT/mt-search.cgi?search=stephanie+madsen&amp;IncludeBlogs=6&amp;limit=20\">Read more Cancerwise posts by Stephanie Madsen</a>.<br /><br />To read more about Stephanie Madsen, <a href=\"http://www.derailingmydiagnosis.com/\">visit her blog</a>.</i><br /><br /><b>To schedule an appointment at MD Anderson, please call 1-877-632-6789 or <a href=\"request%20an%20appointment%20online.\">request an appointment online</a>.</b><br />]]>     </content> </entry>  <entry>     <title>20 ways to feel closer to loved ones during cancer treatment</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www2.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/2015/02/20-ways-to-feel-closer-to-loved-ones-during-cancer-treatment.html\" />     <id>tag:www2.mdanderson.org,2015:/cancerwise//6.3392</id>      <published>2015-02-10T13:30:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-02-11T20:28:17Z</updated>      <summary>We asked our Facebook community what they do to stay connected with their loved ones during cancer treatment.

Whether you're a patient, caregiver, family member or friend of a patient, it's emotionally tough for everyone. But those relationships can be what help you through your cancer journey the most. So, what can you do to stay close with your loved ones while dealing with cancer? <br /><br />We asked <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MDAnderson\">our Facebook community</a> what they do to stay connected with their loved ones during treatment. Here's what they had to say. ]]>         <![CDATA[<ol><li>Start a blog or <a href=\"https://www.carepages.com/\">CarePages</a> site. This is one way to let others feel included in your cancer journey, while keeping you from having to share the same details and feelings over and over again.&nbsp; </li><li>Use social media, like Facebook, Instagram or Twitter to keep in touch and share updates.</li><li>Video chat using a webcam.&nbsp;</li><li>Chat on the phone. </li><li>Send a text message. </li><li>Have a date night. Or girl's night. Or family game night. Whatever. The most important thing is that you dedicate a night -- or day -- to the two of you. </li><li>Celebrate the milestones, whether it's a last day of treatment, or the day before a surgery.</li><li>Laugh together. Find the humor in your cancer journey -- or better yet, in life outside of cancer.</li><li>Pray. </li><li>Give a care package. Include their favorite things or things you think they could use in the hospital: books, games, a blanket, favorite snacks, music they enjoy listening to. Whatever you choose will bring a smile to your loved one's face.</li><li>Talk openly. Don't hold back. Let your loved one know about what you're going through and experiencing. It will help him or her understand and bring you two closer together.</li><li>Listen. Cancer can be a lonely experience. Sometimes it helps to just lend an ear and let your loved one share his or her feelings and struggles.</li><li>Forgive.</li><li>Cook meals.</li><li>Drive together.</li><li>Spend an afternoon at a museum. </li><li>Go to dinner at your loved one's favorite restaurant.</li><li>Make some popcorn and host a movie night in. </li><li>Sit with your loved one during your treatment.&nbsp;</li><li>Just be there.</li></ol><br />What's helped you stay connected to your loved ones during your cancer journey?
