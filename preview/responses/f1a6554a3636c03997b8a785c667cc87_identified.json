The objective of this project is ultimately to facilitate communications between the operator community and the IETF to help ensure that operational realities inform the development of key standards. The first phase of this project was a survey of the operator community that was conducted over the first half of 2014. This I-D aims to synthesize the initial survey results, along with information we collected directly from operators during the survey window. The primary purpose of doing this is to start a conversation which we hope will lead to increases in the level of operational input and feedback to the IETF standards making process.</t>           </abstract>      <note title=\"Requirements Language\">       <t>The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL        NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and        \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described        in <xref target=\"RFC2119\">RFC 2119</xref>.         </t>      </note>    </front>    <middle>     <?rfc include=\"00-intro.xml\" ?>         <?rfc include=\"01-survey-respondents.xml\" ?>         <?rfc include=\"02-potential-challenges.xml\" ?>       <?rfc include=\"03-possible-sollutions.xml\" ?>       <?rfc include=\"04-conclusions.xml\" ?>        <section anchor=\"IANA\" title=\"IANA Considerations\">       <t>This document makes no request of IANA.</t>        <t>Note to RFC Editor: this section may be removed on publication       as an RFC.</t>     </section>      <section anchor=\"Acknowledgments\" title=\"Acknowledgments\">       <t>Because the survey and many of our conversations were conducted anonymously, we have left this section blank at this time.
