The guidance for creating heat-related Nationally Consistent Data and Measures (NCDMs) were developed by funded tracking states.&#13;</purpose> <supplinf>Data has been de-identified to protect patient confidentiality.  Heat-related deaths are selected based on cause of death (including underlying and immediate, intermediate, and contributing causes) coding: http://www.ehib.org/page.jsp?page_key=896#heat_classification.&#13; &#13; The California EPHT Program receives calendar year vital records Multiple Cause of Death files (MCOD) from the state&apos;s Center for Health Statistics (CHS). These files were created by the National Center for Health Statistics. Each record may include up to 20 causes of death derived from California death certificates. All causes of death are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases version 10.&#13; Further information on the California Center for Health Statistics and their available data is located at: http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/dataresources/requests/Pages/VitalStatisticsBirthDeathFetalDeathMarriageData.aspx. &#13; </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20120913</caldate> <time/> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.5</westbc> <eastbc>-114.1</eastbc> <northbc>42.0</northbc> <southbc>32.5</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ICD-10-CM</themekt> <themekey>Heat stroke and sunstroke: T67.0, heat syncope: T67.1, heat cramps: T67.2, heat exhaustion from water depletion: T67.3, heat exhaustion from salt depletion: T67.4, heat exhaustion, unspecified: T67.5, heat fatigue, transient: T67.6, heat edema: T67.7, other specified heat effects: T67.8, unspecified effects of heat and light: T67.9, exposure to excessive natural heat: X30.</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst> Restricted (secure) data will only be released to external users after the California EPHT Program and representatives from OSHPD have reviewed the request.

Each year, CEHTP obtains the MCOD dataset from CHS and creates datasets to  be used for public health surveillance while maintaining confidentiality.   &#13;&#13; This dataset on the CEHTP portal includes deaths due to heat for May-September for the years 2000-2009.  Each event is identified by looking at cause of death (underlying, intermediate, etc.) based on the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).  A diagnostic ICD-10-CM code of T67.X or X30 indicates the underlying or contributing cause of death was heat. &#13;&#13; Counts, rates, and confidence intervals were calculated by age-group, gender, and race/ethnicity.To calculate rates, we use population data from the California Department of Finance (DOF).  DOF uses year 2000 population data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and takes into account survival rates, migration patterns, and fertility rates for California to project the California population by county, race/ethnicity, age, and gender for 2000-2050 (State of California, Department of Finance, Population Projections for California and Its Counties 2000-2050, Sacramento, California, July 2007). &#13;&#13; Confidence intervals for rates of hospitalizations and ED visits are calculated using the Tiwari, Clegg, and Zou (Methods in Medical Research, 2006; 15:547-569).
