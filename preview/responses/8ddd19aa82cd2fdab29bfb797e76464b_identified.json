Is there a way for ESS to recognize these 7  lines are one command and run them with only one shift-enter?  I know of ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph-and-step , which  would run that whole thing in one go, but then it would also execute  subsequent commands (the \"head(iris)\" in above snippet) that are not  separated by a newline.  So ideally, I am looking for a command to bind to shift-enter that would  run the above thing in six hits: one per library, one for the multiline  command, and one for the head(iris).  If that doesn't exist, I'll use  ess-eval-region-or-function-or-paragraph-and-step, which would force me  to use more newlines in my code, but has the advantage of running all  the library commands with one hit.

I wrote some code for data management using proc sql and the data step. I got it working in interactive mode (where \"working\" means I see the same dataset that my coworker sees independently, using his own programming). However, when I run it in batch mode, the dataset it produces is not right. I did a little poking at it looks like the batch mode version grabs the first \"slice\" of the data alphabetically, sliced along one of the variables I'm using to merge the datasets, but ignores the remaining 27 slices (i.e. the rows containing other values of this variable).  I could almost understand it if the interactive mode were producing something wrong. But the fact that the batch mode is getting it wrong... that really puzzles me. It happens both when I use the menu SAS-&amp;gt;Submit File and also when I skip emacs and just run it from the command line.  Has anyone ever seen anything like this?

In Rmd file for slides, I see problem that lines beginning with dash are pushed to the left margin. I'm writing presentations.  I type this  - pt one     - sub one     -sub two  for nested list.  I usually insert 4 spaces manually, have also tested 2 tabs entry method. In Emacs 24.4 with polymode installed last week, I see problem that the indented lines float back to left side (for no reason I can discern).  Sometimes happens repeatedly, I type space and look back as it disappears.  Have uninstalled polymode and same does not happen, so far as I can tell.  If others don't see same, it means my init file conveniences are causing trouble again, I suppose.  pj Paul Johnson http://pj.freefaculty.org  [[alternative HTML version deleted]]  ______________________________________________ ESS-help&amp;lt; at &amp;gt;r-project.org mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/ess-help  &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Paul Johnson</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-02-27T12:46:46</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8680\">     <title>how to leverage ESS parsing to find current module in Juliabuffer</title>     <link>http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8680</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;Hi,  I am still working on improving ESS/Julia, especially the evaluation context. The problem I am facing is finding the relevant module for evaluation --- I thought I can simply search backwards with a regexp, but submodules complicate this.  For example, if a buffer contains  --8&amp;lt;---------------cut here---------------start-------------&amp;gt;8--- module Parent  module Child1 f(x) = x+1 end  module Child2 g(x) = x+1                      # eval here end  end --8&amp;lt;---------------cut here---------------end---------------&amp;gt;8---  and the user presses C-c C-c on the line that contains  g(x) = x+1                      # eval here  then the relevant module for eval is Parent.Child2. If I naively search backwards and collect all module lines that match a regexp, I get Parent, Child1, and Child2.  So it seems I would have to parse the file somehow in Emacs. But I notice that ESS already does some of that, since it indents everything correctly. Can I somehow use that to extract a list of open (ie not terminated with an \"end\") module expressions up to a given position?

I am not an experienced Emacs Lisp programmer and I don't know the internals of ESS, so I would like to ask for some help --- I have some Common Lisp experience. First, I just want to experiment, then submit a PR when https://github.com/emacs-ess/ESS/pull/122 is merged.  My question is the following: for each piece of code that is sent to the inferior process, I would need to wrap it in some Julia code. For example, for evaluating within a module, I would search backward in the buffer for something like \"module\\\\s-\\\\(\\\\w.*\\\\)\\\\s-\" to find the module name, and then send  (concat \"eval(\" module_name \", :(\" string \"))\")  Which function should I modify for this? ESS-SEND-STRING is not using the buffer any more, and I don't know if I should modify ESS-SEND-REGION.  BTW, what's the best way to use ESS from a git repo? Just add the lisp diretory to the load path, and that's it?

I'm a fairly new emacs user, a very new user of ESS[SAS], and an extremely new subscriber to this list (so apologies if I violate list etiquette). I'm using GNU emacs 23.4.1 (2012-06-05) and SAS 9.3 on Unix (SunOS 5.10).  I have noticed that code which works when submitted as an entire file will not work when I submit it region by region. Here is an example:  libname mylib \"/.\";  data temp; set mylib.temp; run;  Assume that I have a directory as specified in libname and there is a SAS dataset called temp in it -- my code works properly when I submit the whole thing, but if I run just the first line and then the second, it tells me that \"mylib\" is not defined.  Based on the behavior of the log files -- the second submission creates a log file that overwrites the first -- I think what is going on is that it's starting a new SAS session with each submission. Why might it be doing this? I find I make fewer programming errors if I test things incrementally rather than running all my code in batch mode, so I would really like to find a fix to this.  The only other clue I have is a pair of warnings I get on every submission:  NOTE: Unable to open SASUSER.REGSTRY. WORK.REGSTRY will be opened      instead. NOTE: All registry changes will be lost at the end of the session.  WARNING: Unable to copy SASUSER registry to WORK registry. Because of      this, you will not see registry customizations during this session. NOTE: Unable to open SASUSER.PROFILE. WORK.PROFILE will be opened      instead. NOTE: All profile changes will be lost at the end of the session.  I googled those warnings separately and found they're commonly associated with a corrupt SAS profile, but unfortunately the recommended fix did not fix anything (after deleting the iffy profile, it just restored itself and the error persisted). I am not sure whether this is related or not.  Has anyone here seen the behavior I'm describing? Any ideas about a fix?

In the process, I've learned a couple of things. I wonder if these messages should be conveyed to users more bluntly  1. It is VITAL to go into the Mac's Mission Control and change the shortcut keys.  THey are currently using Control-up arrow and Control-down arrow as window manager things, and if you don't free up those shortcuts, your like in the R console is empty, without any joy whatsoever.  This seems like such a vital piece of advice that it should be plainly stated somewhere on the \"R for mac users\".  Advice sheets I find generally assume a user likes Macs and Emacs and neither is true for most of these users, they just want to know what to do.  2. Also we need to say \"XQuartz\" is a mandatory install, there's no point having R without it.   Now, my question.  3. In Emacs Mac, How do you save the output from *R* as a text file?  I told the users to just save the *R* window with File-&amp;gt;save as and give the file the same name as the R file and a suffix \"Rout\".  User came in showing that when he saves the transcript, Emacs only saves a backup file, it never gets promoted to a real file. I mean, it is always marked #.  WHen emacs closes down, it says do you want to save the files, but in the end the result is always #backup.Rout#  I realize now the workflow I use is proabably wrong.  I should have told him to close the R session, then try to save the *R* windows with a file name whatever.Rout. Is that what you would do?  &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Paul Johnson</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-02-09T17:34:13</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8644\">     <title>[OT] New Emacs Modified version</title>     <link>http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8644</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;Please note that I updated my Emacs Modified distributions for OS X and Windows earlier this week.   http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/emacs  From the NEWS file:  Version 24.4-modified-2 (2 February 2015) =========================================  UPDATES  o AUCTeX 11.88  and additionally, on Windows:  NEW FEATURES  o GnuTLS libraries are now included to allow Emacs to access web sites   using https; see      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17219643/cant-install-emacs-el-get-package-emacs-cant-connect-to-the-internet    for a rationale.

I have a problem : the first call (\"?geom_line\" at the R prompt) works fine, but a second call (\"?geom_linerange\" at the R prompt) ends up in error with \"ess--switch-to-help-buffer: Window is dedicated to `*help[R](geom_line)*' in the minibuffer (retrieved form the *Messages* buffer).  (setq ess-help-own-frame 'one) works as advertised. The code (in ess-help.el) is not specially enlightening : it uses *ONE* frame, defined in (defvar ess-help-frame ...). So it appears that the code *is* intended to display exactly *one* help page at a time, with two variants : - switching to the last requested help page when ess-help_own-frame is 'one - raising an error when ess-help-own-frame is t and the ess-help-frame still exists.  Do you see a way to effect what I *thought* was advertised : at each call to the R help system, open (if necessary) a new frame to display the relevant help page ?  Sincerely,  Emmanuel Charpentier  PS : I'd appreciate being CC'd of answers (including \"Go to hell if necessary) : I do not follow ess-help on a regular basis. (Yes, I should... but my days are still 24 hours long, despite my wishes...).  ______________________________________________ ESS-help&amp;lt; at &amp;gt;r-project.org mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/ess-help  &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Emmanuel Charpentier</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-25T10:15:56</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8625\">     <title>Mac OSX 10.10.1 Yosemite can't find R</title>     <link>http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8625</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;This system  Student in my office now showing me Emacs with ESS (From Vincent Goulet's website) and when we open an R file, all seems well.

For comments /* */ at the end of lines or after the continuation sequence /// subsequent lines indent indefinitely. For code of more than 2 lines, this can get very nested looking (see below):  recode educ 0 = 1 ///     5 = 2 ///         10 = 3 ///             15 = 4 ///                 20 = 5 ///                     25 = 6  Is there a workaround for this? I *really* like running Stata through ESS and would love to use it this way as much as I can.  For now, I've been editing in Bill Rising's ado mode and sending to Stata through ESS. The drawback to this approach is that every time I open a new do file (which I do often to edit single lines here and there for a big project), I have to indicate which dialect of ESS I am using in the buffer line.

For instance,  $ emacs read.R &amp;amp; works fine in that ESS toolbar icons present  And so does starting an emacs server from a running emacs with server-start and then using emacsclient  However if emacs is started in a bash script with --daemon option (named or unnamed) then the ESS menu items don't appear on toolbar when emacsclient is used. Alternatively,  $ emacsclient --alternate-editor=\"\" -c read.R  and other variants such as starting the server daemon with say $ emacs --daemon=test1 $ emacs -s test1 -c read.R also does not produce ESS menu items  The ESS menus are there so things are relatively easy but can anyone suggest how I can debug this to track down the problem of disappearing toolbar items  Thanks Peter  &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Peter Baker</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-21T03:35:19</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8614\">     <title>ESS + Stata: not reading continuation lines in syntax ///</title>     <link>http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/8614</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt;Hi - I've tried to look for the answer to this online, but to no avail. I have code in Stata that I'm trying to read using ESS, and the problem is that ESS is not sending the code to Stata correctly. Here is the syntax:  keep if country == 1 /* Austria */ ///   | country == 2 /* Belgium */ ///   | country == 3 /* Switzerland */ ///   | country == 4 /* Czech Rep. */ ///   | country == 5 /* Germany */ ///   | country == 6 /* Denmark */ ///   | country == 7 /* Spain */ ///   | country == 8 /* Finland */ ///   | country == 9 /* France */ ///   | country == 10 /* UK */ ///   | country == 11 /* Greece */ ///   | country == 12 /* Hungary */ ///   | country == 13 /* Ireland */ ///   | country == 15 /* Italy */ ///   | country == 16 /* Luxembourg */ ///   | country == 17 /* Netherlands */ ///   | country == 18 /* Norway */ ///   | country == 19 /* Poland */ ///   | country == 20 /* Portugal */ ///   | country == 21 /* Sweden */ ///   | country == 22 /* Slovenia */  This should be read as one long command, with comments (/* */) and continuation lines at the end (///). The comments are taken out just fine, but when ESS sends the code to Stata, it breaks the command up by lines. So Stata thinks that the first line is a separate command, the second line a separate command, etc. Is there any way to fix this, as I have several syntax files written this way? I am working from Mac OSX (10.7.5) and the latest version of Emacs (24.4).  ______________________________________________ ESS-help&amp;lt; at &amp;gt;r-project.org mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/ess-help  &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>aarjpon</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2015-01-20T18:36:58</dc:date>   </item>   <textinput rdf:about=\"http://search.gmane.org/?group=$group=gmane.emacs.ess.general\">     <title>Search Engine</title>     <description>Search the mailing list at Gmane</description>     <name>query</name>     <link>http://search.gmane.org/?group=$group=gmane.emacs.ess.general</link>   </textinput> </rdf:RDF> ",
