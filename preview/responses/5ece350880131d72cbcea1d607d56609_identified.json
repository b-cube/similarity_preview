One dataset contains annualized measures calculated for California counties, while the other contains identical measures calculated for California census tracts.</abstract> <purpose>This data set contributes to the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. Through the use of the California Environmental Health Tracking Program&apos;s information portal, it is intended that interested parties can visualize disparities and trends for these measures across racial and ethnic groups, geographic areas, and time periods.  For geographic units for which data are sparse (rural counties and most census tracts), many measures are additionally calculated using spatial modeling.  These calculations are intended to provide &quot;best estimates&quot; for areas in which information is limited and to assist in visualization of broader geographic trends.</purpose> <supplinf>See http://www.ehib.org/page.jsp?page_key=68</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <rngdates> <begdate>19960101</begdate> <enddate>20061231</enddate> </rngdates> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>In work</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.5</westbc> <eastbc>-114.1</eastbc> <northbc>42.0</northbc> <southbc>32.5</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>Health</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>None</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>CEHTP Science Team</cntper> <cntorg>CDPH/EHIB</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos/> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>850 Marina Bay Parkway, Bldg P, 3rd Floor&#13; &#13; </address> <city>Richmond</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>94804</postal> <country>United States Of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(510)620-3620</cntvoice> <cnttdd/> <cntfax>(510)620-3720</cntfax> <cntemail>data@cehtp.org</cntemail> <hours/> <cntinst/> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <secinfo> <secsys>None</secsys> <secclass>Unclassified</secclass> <sechandl>None</sechandl> </secinfo> <native>The dataset consists of data and measures related to maternal and infant health. The measures include preterm birth among singletons, very preterm birth among singletons, term low birthweight among singletons, very low birthweight among singletons, infant mortality, perinatal mortality, neonatal mortality, post-neonatal mortality, fertility, and sex ratios among newborns.&#13; Statistical Analysis: SAS 9.1.3, R 2.7.1, WinBUGS 1.4, Microsoft SQL Server 2005, ArcGIS version 9.0.&#13; Operating System: Microsoft Windows XP; Microsoft Server 2003&#13; Filename: &#13; Dataset size:&#13; </native> </idinfo> <dataqual> <logic>As needed, information for each indicator is derived from the following files compiled by the California Center for Health Statistics, Office of Health Information and Research:  Birth Statistical Master Files, Birth Cohort Files, and Fetal Death Statistical Master Files.  Logic applied for inclusion of records in calculation varied by indicator and geographic resolution.  For census tract-level -- but not county-level -- calculations, only records that were successfully geocoded were included.  Only singleton births were included for the following indicators:  preterm birth, very preterm birth, term low birthweight, very low birthweight, and sex ratio at birth.  Only records for which birthweight and estimated gestational age were judged consistent using an established algorithm (Obstetrics and Gynecology 1996;87(2):163-168) were included for the following indicators:  preterm birth, very preterm birth, term low birthweight, very low birthweight, and perinatal mortality.  Only records for which birth and death master files had been linked to construct cohort outcome files by the California Center for Health Statistics were included for the following indicators:  infant mortality, neonatal mortality, perinatal mortality, and postneonatal mortality.</logic> <complete>Birth certificate records are considered to be relatively complete, although the completeness of specific fields may vary.  Protocols for eliciting race/ethnicity information may vary by reporting institution, as do methods for establishing gestational age.  Discrepancies between racial/ethnic groups and between rural and urban residents have been noted regarding consistency and geocodability of recorded address information.  Although none of these discrepancies have been demonstrated to substantively alter geographic or demographic patterns for these health outcomes, such limitations should be kept in mind for their interpretation.</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>Residence addresses at time of birth were standardized and verified using ZP4 (Semaphore Corporation, Pismo Beach, CA) and subsequently geocoded using ArcGIS version 9.0 (ESRI, Redlands, CA).  Geocoded address coordinates were taken from the first successful match of the following four street centerline datasets (in order):  Geographic Data Technology (GDT) Dynamap/2000 version 13 (TeleAtlas, Lebanon, NH), Navigation Technologies NAVSTREETS (NAVTEQ, Chicago, IL), TeleAtlas MutliNet streets (TeleAtlas), and the U.S. Census Bureau TIGER 2000 system (Washington, DC).  For each street centerline data set, residences were geocoded by matching to street address attributes (e.g. prefix, number, name) and the ZIP code, or, if the ZIP code was unsuccessful, the city name.  The resulting coordinates were intersected with GDT 2000 census tract polygons for final census tract assignments.  This process was considered successful for approximately 95-96% of records, depending on the year.</procdesc> <procdate></procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Birth certificate records contain two variables referring respectively to &quot;race&quot; and &quot;hispanicity&quot;.  Reduction of this information to a single &quot;race/ethnicity&quot; variable follows the convention of allowing the &quot;Hispanic&quot; category to include any race; all records not designated as Hispanic or a sub-category thereof are implicitly &quot;Non-Hispanic&quot; (e.g. &quot;Non-Hispanic Whites&quot;, &quot;Non-Hispanic African-Americans&quot;, etc).  The resulting categories employed for maternal race/ethnicity therefore included:  Black/African/African-Americans, Asian/Asian-Americans (including all East, Southeast, and South Asians but not Filipinas), Filipinas, Pacific Islanders (including Hawaiians, Guamanians, Samoans, and unspecified), Hispanics (Mexicans, Mexican-Americans, Central- and South- Americans), Native Americans (including Eskimos and Aleuts), White/European-Americans, and all others.  This procedure classified 97-98% of records with respect to Hispanicity and 96-99% with respect to race, depending on the year.</procdesc> <procdate></procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>For the estimated gestational age given in the birth record, birthweight was classified as being within or outside credible limits as documented by Alexander, et al (Obstetrics and Gynecology 1996;87(2):163-168).  For outcomes contingent upon valid gestational age and/or birthweight data, records non-credible records were excluded from further analysis.  This occurred for approximately 6-9% of records, depending on the year.</procdesc> <procdate></procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Outcome status for each record was determined as follows:  Preterm birth, singleton delivery prior to 37 completed weeks of gestation; very preterm birth, singleton delivery prior to 32 completed weeks of gestation; term low birthweight, singleton delivery after 37 or more completed weeks of gestation with birthweight less than 2,500 grams; very low birthweight, singleton delivery with birthweight less than 1,500 grams (any gestational age); infant mortality, live birth followed by death prior to 12 completed months of age; neonatal mortality, live birth followed by death prior to 28 days of age; perinatal mortality, fetal death (stillbirth) after 28 completed weeks of gestation or live birth followed by death prior to 7 days of age; postneonatal mortality, live birth followed by death between 28 days and 12 months of age.</procdesc> <procdate></procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Outcome rates were calculated whenever twelve or more of the above events were present as follows:  Preterm birth, per 100 singleton births; very preterm birth, per 100 singleton births; term low birthweight, per 100 singleton births after 27 or more completed weeks of gestation; very low birthweight, per 100 singleton births; infant mortality, per 1,000 live births; neonatal mortality, per 1,000 live births; perinatal mortality, per 1,000 live births plus fetal deaths after 28 completed weeks of gestation; postneonatal mortality per 1,000 live births.  Total fertility rates are numbers of births per 1,000 women summed for six age groups (15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, and 40-44 years of age), multiplied by five (denominators based on 2000 U. S. Census).  Sex ratio is the number of male divided by the number of female live singleton births.</procdesc> <procdate></procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Confidence intervals for rates of preterm birth, very preterm birth, term low birthweight, very low birthweight, and all mortality rates are calculated using the modified Wilson&apos;s score method (Croarkin C and Tobias P, Sect 7.2.4.1: Confidence Intervals.  From NIST/SEMATECH Engineering Statistics Handbook, http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc241.htm).  Confidence intervals for sex ratios are arrived at by first calculating such intervals for the rates of male birth (numbers of males over total births) and transforming the resulting interval limits to sex ratios.  Confidence intervals for total fertility rates are generated using the method of Tiwari, et al (Statistical Methods in Medical Research, 2006;15:547-569), employing a hypothetical standard population with equal stratum sizes for each of the six age groups.</procdesc> <procdate></procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Modeled rates are calculated for rates of preterm birth, very preterm birth, term low birthweight, term low birthweight, and all mortality rates through the use of a Hierarchical Bayesian model following the method of Besag, et al (Ann. Inst. Statist. Math 1991;43:1-59); medians from each posterior distribution are taken as point estimates for the geographic unit in question.  Each outcome is considered a Poisson process with both structured and unstructured components; the latter component is based on a normal distribution conditional upon the adjacency of geographic units (&quot;CAR/normal&quot;).  The model is modified by the addition of a redundant parameter for the unstructured variability to speed convergence (Gelman A and Hill J, 2008. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Pp. 419-427).  Data are processed using R 2.7.1 (R Development Core Team (2008). R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. ISBN 3-900051-07-0, URL http://www.R-project.org) and passed to WinBUGS 1.4 (Lunn DJ, Thomas A, Best N, Spiegelhalter D. WinBUGS -- a Bayesian modelling framework: concepts, structure, and extensibility. Statistics and Computing. 2000;10:325-337) using the R packages R2WinBUGS (Sturtz S, Ligges U, Gelman A. R2WinBUGS: A Package for Running WinBUGS from R. Journal of Statistical Software, 2005;12(3):1-16) and coda (Plummer M, Best N, Cowles K, Vines K (2008). coda: Output analysis and diagnostics for MCMC. R package version 0.13-2.).   Burn-in periods are determined as the number of iterations required for the higher-order parameters to converge as judged by the Gelman statistic (Gelman A, Rubin DB. Inference from iterative simulation using multiple sequences. Statistical Science 1992;7:457-511).  Thinning intervals to account for autocorrelation among the higher-order parameters are based on their effective size accounting for serial autocorrelation; sampling is conducted until the vast majority of geographic units have effective size after thinning greater than 1,000.
