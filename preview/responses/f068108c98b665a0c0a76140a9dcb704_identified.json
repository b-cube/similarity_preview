The purpose of the survey was to gather data to map the regional geology of the area. A total of 1677 km of good quality data were collected. Sea floor data were collected using an echo-sounder. Subsurface data were gathered using a suite of seismic instruments (airgun, sparker and pinger), plus a gravity meter and a magnetometer. Most of the data were recorded digitally, but paper output was also generated. The data are archived by BGS. Technical details of the survey are contained in BGS Internal Report IR/03/177.</dc:description>    <dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2003-08-28</dc:date> </oai_dc:dc>",
