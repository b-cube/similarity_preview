VCGI extracted the imagery from a larger dataset developed by 3001 Inc for the Federal government.  The MISC_0_3M_CLR_2008 extract is limited to all collected imagery north and south of the VT/Canadian border.  The imagery has been kept in its native coordinate system (UTM zone 18 and 19).  For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 6 meter horizontal RMSE for locations within the United States. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum, spheroid GRS80. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. </abstract> <purpose>These data have been created as a result of the need for having geospatial data immediately available and easily accessible in order to provide geographic reference for federal, state, and local emergency responders, as well as for homeland security efforts.  Orthoimages also serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for earth science investigations and analysis.  The digital orthoimage is useful as a layer of a geographic information system.  These data can be used to provide reference information for web browsers and for map applications at a scale of 1:100,000 or smaller.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <mdattim> <sngdate> <caldate>20080729</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080821</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080822</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080823</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080901</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080905</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080919</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080920</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080922</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080923</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20080925</caldate> </sngdate> <sngdate> <caldate>20081007</caldate> </sngdate> </mdattim> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Irregular</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-73.43831111</westbc> <eastbc>-73.41906111</eastbc> <northbc>44.58466111</northbc> <southbc>44.57090278</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>None</themekt> <themekey>digital spatial data</themekey> <themekey>0.3 meter orthoimage</themekey> <themekey>rectified image</themekey> <themekey>orthophoto</themekey> <themekey>natural color orthophoto</themekey> <themekey>digital orthophoto image map (DOI)</themekey> <themekey>orthoimage</themekey> <themekey>image map</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Category</themekt> <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, Dependencies, Areas of Special Sovereignty, and Their Principal Administrative Divisions (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.</placekt> <placekey>United States</placekey> <placekey>U.S.</placekey> <placekey>US</placekey> <placekey>CA</placekey> <placekey>VT</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1987, Codes for the Identification of the States, the District of Columbia and the outlying areas of the United States, and associated areas (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 5-2): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.</placekt> <placekey>VT</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt> <placekey>Vermont</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>AOI #055</placekey> <placekey>AOI #056</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>B055</placekey> <placekey>B056</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst> Any downloading and use of these data signifies a users agreement to comprehension and compliance of the U.S. Government Standard Disclaimer.

The imagery was collected at an average altitude of 9843 ft above mean terrain (AMT) using a frame-based Z/I Imaging Digital Mapping Camera (DMC). Overlap between adjacent frames along the flight line was approximately 60% and overlap between adjacent flight lines was approximately 30%.  Corrections for camera and airplane exterior orientation (EO) variations were made with input from a combination of ground-, plane-, and space-based survey inputs (e.g., ABGPS, IMU, CORS Stations, Base Stations).  The DMC collects 12-bit image data per channel which are resampled during post processing to standard 8-bit image data.  The reduction in dynamic range (from 4,096 to 256) is performed in a manner designed to capture the greatest amount of information in each image, and preserve bright and dark values. Image quality was verified during the post flight review phase. Factors considered during this review included but were not limited to the presence of smoke and/or cloud cover, contrails, light conditions and sun glint.  Pan-sharpened red, green, blue, and NIR bands were combined to generate digital image frames.  Geometric correction of mosaicked frames of land areas within and laterally contiguous to the United States was performed via aerial triangulation and orthorectification using a recent DSM of the area provided as GFI (SRTM2, DTED2, Intermap NEXTmap USA, Canada NED, Mexican Border Lidar), and supplemented with higher resolution DSM data where readily available. The vertical accuracy of the DSM varies based on the elevation postings of GFI products and requirements thereof.  Color balancing was performed to reduce radiometric variability between frames, and seamlines were generated using both automated and manual methods.  Project specified tiles of the red, green, and blue bands were extracted from the mosaic to produce a natural color digital orthophoto image map.  Final image tiles were reviewed for artifacts and anomalies and adjusted as part of quality control procedures. When necessary, local corrections to the imagery were performed to minimize such effects.</procdesc> <procdate>20080826</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntorgp>3001, Inc.</cntorgp> </cntinfo> </proccont> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> Copy of boarder imagery provided to VCGI by USGS.
