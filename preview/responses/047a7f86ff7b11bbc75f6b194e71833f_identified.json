In an effort to set the cornerstone for an internet without central authorities and &amp;nbsp;monopolies,&amp;nbsp;network engineers throughout the world have started creating&amp;nbsp;community networks. To enhance this effort, Community-lab,&amp;nbsp;a wireless community networks testbed, was created allowing&amp;nbsp;researchers to experiment with new protocols and applications&amp;nbsp;in a realistic environment. Nevertheless, this testbed does not offer&amp;nbsp;the ability to perform L2 experiments. To address this gap, we&amp;nbsp;developed a platform that allows Community-Lab researchers to&amp;nbsp;perform L2 experiments. Moreover, we decided to reach our goal&amp;nbsp;using Software Defined Networking(SDN) techniques, due to the&amp;nbsp;attention they received lately and their promise for a complete&amp;nbsp;networking solution. Overall, we propose an architecture that&amp;nbsp;allows researchers to perform L2 experiments in a generic&amp;nbsp;community networks testbed. To prove the feasibility of our&amp;nbsp;archtecture we implemented it for Community-Lab using the&amp;nbsp;OpenFlow SDN protocol, enabling researchers to manage the L2&amp;nbsp;topology of their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>     </record>      </records> </xml>",
