However, this report by the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Social Science Council (ISSC) finds that of the 169 targets beneath the 17 draft goals, just 29% are well defined and based on the latest scientific evidence, while 54% need more work and 17% are weak or non-essential.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The assessment of the targets \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which are intended to operationalise  the 17 goals set to be approved by governments later in 2015 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is the  first of its kind to be carried out by the scientific community, and  represents the work of over 40 leading researchers covering a range of  fields across the natural and social sciences.</p> <p>However, the report finds the targets suffer from a lack of  integration, some repetition and rely too much on vague, qualitative  language rather than hard, measurable, time-bound, quantitative targets.</p> <p>Authors are also concerned the goals are presented in \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsilos.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The goals  address challenges such as climate, food security and health in  isolation from one another.

Open access to the scientific literature and to related data and software is a powerful mechanism for creating and validating knowledge, and for supporting the development of science as a public good rather than as an activity conducted behind closed doors. It is consistent with the Principle of Universality of Science (Statute 5 of the International Council for Science), which requires \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfreedom \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of communication for scientists, as well as equitable access to data, information and other resources for research\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights also includes as a fundamental principle the right to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.</p> <p>Much of the discussion to date on open access has focussed on the economics of traditional science journal publishing, but we are rapidly moving into a new era in which there will be many dissemination mechanisms for the outputs of scientific research, and universal access to these outputs is achievable. The transition to this new era presents both challenges and opportunities.<br />Increasingly, those involved in the administration of research rely on metrics designed to assess the importance and impact of research as an aid to evaluation, with publication outputs in\\ufffd\\ufffd traditional scientific journals being the major focus. These metrics in turn affect the behaviour of researchers, such as their choice of journals, as they seek to maximize their performance as measured by the metrics used. They can contribute to the maintenance of high journal prices, promote intense competition rather than openness and sharing, and fail to recognize research contributions such as the production of datasets, software, code, blogs, wikis and forums.</p> <p>The International Council for Science advocates the following goals for open access. The scientific record should be:</p> <ul> <li>free of financial barriers for any researcher to contribute to;</li> <li>free of financial barriers for any user to access immediately on publication;</li> <li>made available without restriction on reuse for any purpose, subject to proper attribution;</li> <li>quality-assured and published in a timely manner; and</li> <li>archived and made available in perpetuity.</li> </ul> <p>These goals apply both to peer-reviewed research publications, the data on which the results and conclusions of this research are based, and any software or code used in the course of the research.</p> <p>Metrics used as an aid to the evaluation of research and researchers should help promote open access and open science, and the scientific community should be fully involved in their design.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-11-06T14:50:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2013/annual-report-2013\">     <title>Annual Report 2013</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2013/annual-report-2013</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 4\"> <div class=\"layoutArea\"> <div class=\"column\"> <h3><span style=\"color: rgb(40.700000%, 55.700000%, 71.000000%); \">M<span style=\"color: rgb(40.700000%, 55.700000%, 71.000000%); \">essage from</span> the President </span></h3> <p><span>In early November 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) struck the Philippines. Horrific as the destruction was, it was for many but a taste of</span><span> \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe new normal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, a future in which escalating human pressures drive environmental changes </span><span>beyond known thresholds. What does this mean </span><span>for the actions and programmes of the International Council for Science? </span></p> <p><span>The ICSU</span><span> </span><span>family has the potential to propel humanity towards a sustainable future. Scientists involved in our programmes have always produced excellent science. And a host of new programmes are poised to continue this legacy \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Integrated Research on Disaster Risk, Urban Health and Wellbeing, World Data System, Future Earth, and many more. Future Earth, in particular, offers an exciting vision for what sustainability science can do: fully involving stakeholders, mobilizing all regions, and driving better policies at every level \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd from defining a set of global Sustainable Development Goals to those of nations and cities. </span></p> <p><span>But if we wish to fulfil our potential, we will need to strive even harder, especially on three fronts: </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; \">First, </span><span>let us better harness the tremendous power of our membership. This echoes my words in last year\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Annual Report. The April 2013 Unions Meeting in Paris offered a plethora of ideas, suggesting concrete projects where National Members, Unions, Programmes and Regional Offices could collaborate to strengthen research, boost science education, influence policies and more. These should serve as a model for our future efforts: ICSU</span><span>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds </span><span>core strength lies in its diverse global membership. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; \">Second, </span><span>let us examine our true impact rigorously. At the General Assembly in August 2014, we will receive early results from the External Review, the first since 1996. This is a tremendous opportunity for ICSU</span><span> </span><span>to examine what has been achieved since the 1996 Review and make sure that it is on </span><span>track for the challenges of the coming decades. I will also pass </span><span>the Presidency to Professor Gordon McBean, an excellent scientist and leader who has played an active role in ICSU</span><span> </span><span>pro</span><span>grammes and activities throughout the years. In the five years </span><span>since my election, humanity marched on in an unsustainable direction. Sustainable development is still an aspiration </span><span>rather than a reality. We must therefore ask: has ICSU</span><span> </span><span>trod the </span><span>right course? What have we achieved? How can we do better? </span></p> </div> <div class=\"column\"> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; \">Third, </span><span>we must be much more action-oriented. As Future Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds vision states, science should have a sense of urgency to contribute to solving real-world problems, to bring about different ways of doing things. That means actively connecting knowledge to action, also by stepping up our communication and engagement with decision-makers and stakeholders. Only then will the evidence we scientists provide make a real difference and ultimately transform the world for better. </span></p> <p><span>A world in which Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) is the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnew normal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is not the future we want for our children and grand</span><span>children. For humanity to be able to respond to the challenges </span><span>posed by anthropogenic environmental changes, it needs to </span><span>rely on solid scientific information providing pathways for hu</span><span>mans to adapt to and mitigate these changes. It is our duty as scientists to deliver that knowledge in a timely and useable </span><span>manner. Let us harness the strengths of our membership, hon</span><span>estly examine the impacts we make, and work relentlessly to connect knowledge to real, tangible action. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 700; \">Yuan Tseh Lee </span></p> <p><span>President </span></p> </div> </div> </div>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-08-29T21:52:02Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/publications/about-icsu/icsu-brochure-august-2014/icsu-brochure\">     <title>ICSU brochure</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/publications/about-icsu/icsu-brochure-august-2014/icsu-brochure</link>     <description>Published: August 2014</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<div class=\"kssattr-macro-text-field-view kssattr-templateId-publicationpagedisplay_view kssattr-atfieldname-text plain\" id=\"parent-fieldname-text\"> <p>This brochure gives a general overview of the Council and its activities, including:</p> <ul> <li>ICSU's mission</li> <li>International research collaboration</li> <li>Science for policy</li> <li>Universality of science</li> </ul> </div>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-08-29T21:35:48Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/publications/cfrs/freedom-responsibility-and-universality-of-science-booklet-2014/freedom-responsibility-and-universality-of-science\">     <title>Freedom, Responsibility and Universality of Science</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/publications/cfrs/freedom-responsibility-and-universality-of-science-booklet-2014/freedom-responsibility-and-universality-of-science</link>     <description>Booklet published: August 2014</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 5\"> <div class=\"layoutArea\"> <div class=\"column\"> <p><span>The International Council for Science </span><span>(ICSU) </span><span>is a non-governmental organization with a global membership composed of </span><span>120 </span><span>national scientific bodies representing </span><span>140 </span><span>countries and </span><span>31 </span><span>International Scientific Unions. Founded in </span><span>1931</span><span>, its vision is that of a world in which science is used for the benefit of all, excellence in science is valued and scientific knowledge is linked to policy making. To achieve this vision, ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds focus is on International Research Collaboration, Science for Policy and Universality of Science. </span></p> <p><span>By advocating the Principle of Universality of Science, ICSU</span><span>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds </span><span>goal is to help build a truly international science community. Because science is inherently a global enterprise, full participation in it requires free </span><span>exchange and communication among all scientists, engagement in scientific discourse without repercussions, or fear thereof, as well as equitable </span><span>and non-discriminatory access to the tools of science. At the same time, these freedoms entail responsibilities on the part of all scientists in the conduct of their scientific work. To address and promote both aspects, ICSU</span><span> </span><span>established the Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science </span><span>(CFRS) </span><span>in </span><span>2006</span><span>. This Committee differs significantly </span><span>from its predecessors that, since </span><span>1963</span><span>, had focused on scientific freedom, </span><span>in that it is explicitly charged with also emphasizing scientific responsibilities. </span></p> <p><span>The Committee\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds enlarged task finds reflection in this brochure, which is a revised version of the CFRS</span><span> </span><span>booklet \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFreedom, Responsibility </span><span>and Universality of Science,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd produced in </span><span>2008</span><span>. It explores the unique relationship between the sciences and societies in which they are practised by providing illustrative examples of how ICSU</span><span> </span><span>and its members, through CFRS</span><span>, have addressed threats to freedom and promoted responsibility. </span></p> </div> </div> </div>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>

meeting was preceded by an international <a href=\"../../../freedom-responsibility/research-integrity/science-assessment-and-research-integrity\">workshop co-sponsored on science assessment and research integrity</a>.</p> <p>Provided below is a summary of the main issues and decisions from the CFRS meeting.</p> <p><b> </b></p> <p><i>Communication with ICSU Membership</i></p> <ul> <li>Brochure \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFreedom and Responsibility in Science\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: finalised the revised brochure for presentation at this year\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds ICSU General Assembly to further a dialogue with the Membership on CFRS\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work</li> <li>CFRS progress report (2011-14) and work plan (2014-17): approved the two documents for submission to the ICSU General Assembly</li> </ul> <p><i>Freedom of science</i></p> <ul> <li>Academic freedom: adopted a document that frames academic freedom in the context of the Principle of Universality of Science and proposed it to the Executive Board for approval as a formal ICSU policy statement for endorsement by the 2014 General Assembly</li> <li>Science exposed to public pressure: adopted an operating document to condemn physical violence against scientists, scientific institutions, experiments or experimental equipment</li> <li>Gender issue in field research: pursued contact with the Research Committee \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWomen in Society\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of the International Sociological Association (ISA), an ICSU Union Member, to further explore the issue of exposure of scientists, particularly women, to particular risks when doing fieldwork</li> <li>Boycott calls against scientific communities: approved a guidance document for organisers of scientific meetings in the Middle East or North Africa, or concerning that region, that rejects boycott calls against specific scientific communities and propagates non-discrimination of scientists related to their country of residence or origin, or their political orientation</li> <li>Visa problems at scientific meetings in the United Kingdom: noted a news piece to alert the ICSU Membership about visa issues in general and specifically with reference to the annual congresses of the ICSU Union Members of Physiological Sciences (IUPS) and of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences (IUAES) in the UK during 2013</li> <li>Persecuted/imprisoned scientists: considered several cases of individual academics around the globe who are persecuted and/or imprisoned related to their carrying out scientific work, deciding to intensify efforts to contribute to the release of Omid Kokabee, a doctoral student in physics imprisoned in Iran since 2011</li> </ul> <p><i>Multilateral engagement</i></p> <ul> <li>UNESCO: Confirmed its commitment to contribute to a redrafting of the 1974 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRecommendation on the Status of Scientific Researchers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and propose the CFRS Chair to henceforth take ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <i>ex officio</i> membership in the UNESCO World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST).</li> </ul> <p><i>Research integrity</i></p> <ul> <li>Science assessment and research integrity: decided to continue working on the nexus between science assessment and research integrity as a follow-up of the international workshop preceding the CFRS meeting and ensure a strong presence for ICSU and CFRS with a session on the subject at the 4<sup>th</sup> World Conference on Research Integrity (WCRI) in 2015.</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>
