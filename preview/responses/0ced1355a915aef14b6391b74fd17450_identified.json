Categories of aquatic, emergent, and terrestrial habitats were determined from hyperspectral imagery and integrated with hydrologic data to identify estuarine fish habitats.  Maps of intertidal and benthic habitat were derived from 12-band, 4-m resolution hyperspectral imagery acquired in September 2002. Habitat characteristics were compared for tidal creeks north and south of the Suwannee River. A range of habitat characteristics and differences in tidal-creek morphology were derived from the imagery. Hydrologic data were collected from tidal creeks during the winter of 2002-03 and the summer-fall of 2003.  Fish were sampled from tidal creeks during March 2003 using rivulet nets, throw traps, and seine nets. Habitat characteristics, hydrologic data, and fish assemblages were compared for tidal creeks north and south of the Suwannee River. This endeavor related nearshore benthic habitat and hydrologic conditions with habitat suitability and fish assemblages and provides an example for applications in shallow and nearshore estuarine environments. A full discussion of the habitats and analysis can be found in U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2007-1382 (Raabe et al., 2007).</abstract> <purpose>The USGS is providing hyperspectral imagery and derived features of the Suwannee River Estuary to support natural resource management in the Lower Suwannee River and Estuary.  The product highlights the effectiveness of using remotely sensed data to map submerged, emergent, and coastal habitats. Results provide an initial view of the dynamic and structural habitats at the Suwannee River estuary, and an example for other shallow and nearshore estuarine environments.</purpose> <supplinf>Multispectral Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imagery (CASI) was collected by Borstad Associates on September 28, 2002. 12-band, 4 meter resolution imagery was post-processed by Borstad Associates and by USGS in St. Petersburg, FL. Spectral range of each band in nm: 1 (418.4-451.9), 2 (479.4-500.9), 3 (540.9-559.0), 4 (594.1-606.9), 5 (633.2-646.1), 6 (663.5-676.4), 7 (676.0-685.3), 8 (699.2-710.4), 9 (713.5-726.5), 10 (745.8-755.2), 11 (778.1-791.0),  12 (853.4-875.3).  Two three-band GeoTIFF images were produced for visualization and identification of general features and field sites: natural-color (Bands 6,3,1; suw_casi_nat.tif) and false-color (Bands 9,7,5; suw_casi_false). A complete 12-band image mosaic is also provided (suw_casi_12b_mosaic.tif). New habitat maps were derived from the 12-band CASI imagery. Image-processing software was used by the USGS to develop mapping categories suitable to refuge management and habitat monitoring. Three maps of derived-features are: three basic categories (submerged, intertidal, and upland), 16 habitat categories, and tidal flood zones as GeoTIFF files in two projections (UTM WGS84 and State Plane NAD83).  Land and water masks were developed from Band 12 to separate aquatic submerged, emergent, and terrestrial features (suw_casi_basic.tif). All features under the emergent/terrestrial mask were categorized simultaneously with an unsupervised classification procedure. Separate classifications were conducted line-by-line in the aquatic submerged zone. Categories between lines were matched and mosaicked to obtain consistent mapping of submerged features.Habitat categories were sieved and filtered for a minimum mapping unit (mmu) of 16 m2. Field teams (USGS, FWS, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection) provided ground-truth data for interpretation and verification of mapping. Error analysis was performed on 16 habitat categories using field-reconnaissance data from over 500 locations. Overall map accuracy exceeds 99% (suw_casi_fullclass.tif). Variations in water penetration and substrate wetness provided an opportunity to map tidal-flood zones. Nine tidal flood zones were derived from the imagery (suw_casi_flood.tif].</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>2002</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc> -83.211691</westbc> <eastbc> -83.052396</eastbc> <northbc> 29.395753</northbc> <southbc> 29.256161</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekey>habitat</themekey> <themekey>estuary</themekey> <themekey>hyperspectral imagery</themekey> <themekey>CASI</themekey> <themekey>intertidal</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekey>Florida</placekey> <placekey>Lower Suwannee River</placekey> <placekey>Gulf of Mexico</placekey> </place> <stratum> <stratkey>benthic</stratkey> <stratkey>emergent</stratkey> <stratkey>terrestrial</stratkey> </stratum> <temporal> <tempkey>2002</tempkey> </temporal> </keywords> <accconst>It is strongly recommended that these data are directly acquired from the distributor described above or from another USGS server and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way.
