This version of the classification is the High Resolution Land Cover (2005-era) for the Island of Niihau, HI. Summary: This section outlines the classification procedure for the Niihau High Resolution C-CAP. Quickbird imagery used in producing this land cover product was also utilized in producing an associated impervious surfaces layer for the island. The mapping approach utilized an object oriented approach. A calibration visit was not conducted. Non impervious features were mapped using a 0.5 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU). Pre-processing steps: The Quickbird mosaic utilized for this project was provided from Digital Globe as an orthorectifed, georeferenced product and was consistent with the quoted 1:12000 spatial accuracy. In conjunction with the Quickbird mosaic, Sanborn used an IKONOS mosaic, as well as a DTM created from a 5m radar collect for the island. The original return image from the radar was also utilized. Field-Collected Data: Training data was not collected. Classification: Segmentation - Image segmentation was completed at multiple scales using the multispectral (2.4 m) imagery in order to group like spectral and textural objects within the imagery. For consistency, the associated impervious data set was incorporated into the segmentation layer as a boundary delimiter. Segments can share boundaries of an impervious surface, but can never overlap an impervious surface. Automated Classification, image segments are classified using a decision tree classifier in See5 software and an iterative nearest neighbor classifier in Definiens software. Nearest neighbor training data is collected through analyst interpretation or ancillary data sets and used to calibrate the classification algorithm. Automated Classification Refinement - Models are built to refine or reclassify land cover areas by utilizing the wealth of attribute information linked to each segment within Definiens. Classification Edits - As with any automated or semi-automated land cover classification there are often inconsistencies in the land cover map. The final step before map finalization was to remove inaccuracies through manual segment labeling as interpreted by an analyst. Map Finalization - Sanborn used independent reviewer's comments to further refine the land cover map. Post processing: The change detection process used to create the 2010 Niihau C-CAP product highlighted some errors in the 2005 land cover map. To create a more accurate product these issues we addressed by NOAA through a combination of spatial models and manual edits.  While the changes may not be large in area and/or be directly reflected in the accuracy assessment, we feel the products more accurately reflect the land cover for the time period.
