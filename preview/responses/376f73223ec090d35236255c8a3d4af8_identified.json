But we have finally left Subversion behind and are now using Git exclusively. Most of the documentation has been updated to reflect the switch, but please let us know if we forgot something and there are still mentions of svn anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This should make getting the latest wxWidgets sources and participating in its development even simpler than before. We still continue to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.wxwidgets.org/&quot;&gt;our own bug tracker&lt;/a&gt;, but you can also submit pull requests on GitHub, if only to test your changes with &lt;a href=&quot;https://travis-ci.org/wxWidgets/wxWidgets&quot;&gt;Travis CI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>wxWidgets 3.0.2 Released</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2014/10/wxwidgets-3.0.2-released/\"/>   <updated>2014-10-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated>   <id>/news/2014/10/wxwidgets-3.0.2-released</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;wxWidgets 3.0.2 maintenance release is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.2/&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;. Upgrading to it is strongly recommended for all users of the previous 3.0.x release as it bring a lot of bug fixes but remains 100% compatible with 3.0.0, both at the API and the ABI level, and so upgrading to it doesn&#39;t require absolutely any changes to the existing applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In addition to the fixes, described in more details in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.2/changes.txt&quot;&gt;change log&lt;/a&gt;, this release also includes a few minor new features, notably a couple of additions to XRC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--more--&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As usual, please download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.2/&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.2/binaries/&quot;&gt;binaries&lt;/a&gt; if you are using one of the supported Windows compilers (Microsoft Visual C++ or &lt;a href=&quot;http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/&quot;&gt;MinGW-TDM&lt;/a&gt;) from SourceForge or our &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.wxwidgets.org/pub/3.0.2/&quot;&gt;FTP mirror&lt;/a&gt;.

We wanted to share the results of these projects today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--more--&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wxGraphicsContext using Direct2D&lt;/strong&gt; - Alexandru Pana has brought together a very functional Direct2D wxGraphicsContext renderer for Windows 7 and later. This work has been merged to wxWidgets SVN trunk. You can review a summary of what has been done &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alexpana/wxWidgets/wiki/Direct2D-Implementation-Progress&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to check out the &quot;drawing&quot; sample!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wxTaskBarButton under Windows Vista/7+&lt;/strong&gt; - Chaobin Zhang has implemented the native Windows 7 taskbar functionality with a very clean and easy to use API available through &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_task_bar_button.html&quot;&gt;wxTaskBarButton&lt;/a&gt;. This project was cut short of an OSX implementation, however, nearly every native feature of the Windows 7 taskbar is available for use, and has been merged to wxWidgets SVN trunk. We would encourage others interested in working on the OSX implemention to get involved now that GSoC has ended. Here&#39;s an &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/zhchbin/wxWidgets/wiki/SOC2014_TASKBAR&quot;&gt;overview of the features&lt;/a&gt;, and be sure to check out the new &quot;taskbarbutton&quot; sample.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chromium backend for wxWebView&lt;/strong&gt; - Haojian Wu has brought wxWidgets the ability to integrate a single common, modern browser engine on all platforms based on the CEF3 library. This adds &lt;a href=&quot;http://hokein.github.io/wxWidgets/classwx_web_view_chromium.html&quot;&gt;wxWebViewChromium&lt;/a&gt; to wxWidgets, but requires a bit more work to enable out of the box due to library dependencies. This has not been merged to SVN trunk yet, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/pull/15&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; to get involved in the review, and it&#39;s new &quot;webview_chromium&quot; sample. Here&#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/hokein/wxWidgets/wiki&quot;&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt; of the project as well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wxQt Port&lt;/strong&gt; - Mariano Reingart continues the work from Peter Most, Javier Torres, Kolya Kosenko, and his own work even back in 2013, building out the new Qt-based wxWidgets port to a usable state. Being one of the more ambitious projects, we&#39;re very pleased to see the success of this project. We&#39;d also like to thank Sean D&#39;Epagnier for his help as well. This work has been merged to SVN trunk. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.wxwidgets.org/browser/wxWidgets/trunk/docs/qt&quot;&gt;installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/WxQt&quot;&gt;project overview and wxQt status&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/pull/14&quot;&gt;merge pull request&lt;/a&gt; with screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wxAndroid Port&lt;/strong&gt; - Nikola Miljkovic worked on this fresh new port, with the goal of building just a single minimal sample into an Android app. The majority of this project involved working out the details of wrapping wxWidgets C++ calls through JNI just for the main required application components. Nikola has achieved this as seen by the wxWidgets-based &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wxwidgets&quot;&gt;android app&lt;/a&gt; in the Google Play Store, but to be clear, this port still requires a lot of work before it&#39;s usable. There aren&#39;t any plans to merge this to SVN trunk just yet, but we would encourage interested developers to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/WxAndroid/docs&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/SRBNikolaSRB/wxWidgets/compare/SOC2014_ANDROID&quot;&gt;SOC2014_ANDROID&lt;/a&gt; branch Nikola has been working on.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wxUniversal Cleanup&lt;/strong&gt; - Sun Boxiang chose to tackle general issues with our very neglected wxUniversal port. About 80 unique issues were resolved while expanding the test coverage from 308 to 518 unit tests. This work has not been merged to SVN trunk yet, but hopefully soon. In the mean time, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/wx-dev/-z-LfabvZko/_f88vzwTuLsJ&quot;&gt;project overview&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Daetalus/wxWidgets/compare/SOC2014_UNIV&quot;&gt;the development branch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once again, we really want to thank all of our students for one of the most exceptional years we&#39;ve had participating in the Google Summer of Code program. We&#39;d also like to thank all of the community who stepped up to help these students besides just their mentors.&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>wxWidgets 3.0.1 Released</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2014/06/wxwidgets-3.0.1-released/\"/>   <updated>2014-06-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated>   <id>/news/2014/06/wxwidgets-3.0.1-released</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;wxWidgets 3.0.1 bug fix release is now &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.1/&quot;&gt;available&lt;/a&gt;.

This is the most projects we have ever had, but unfortunately we still had to reject several other good proposals. We hope to see the students who couldn&#39;t be accepted this year during the next year GSoC.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, congratulations to the students chosen this year and we hope to see a lot of great changes in wxWidgets at the end of the summer. The most exciting project this year is probably the new wxAndroid port, but there are also projects to add support for Direct2D and DirectText, integrate Chromium backend in wxWebView, improve the state of wxUniv port, add support for the Windows taskbar features such as jump lists and even wxQt port.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to all of them and good luck to our students and big thanks to their mentors!&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>NuGet Package with wxWidgets Template</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2014/03/nuget-package-with-wxwidgets-template/\"/>   <updated>2014-03-05T00:00:00-07:00</updated>   <id>/news/2014/03/nuget-package-with-wxwidgets-template</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;Andrew Smart has created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nuget.org/&quot;&gt;NuGet&lt;/a&gt; package containing a template allowing to easily configure and build wxWidgets applications in Microsoft Visual Studio. See the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Microsoft_Visual_C++_NuGet&quot;&gt;detailed instructions&lt;/a&gt; on the wiki and give it a try if you use MSVS 2010 or later!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Notice that the template works with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.0/binaries/&quot;&gt;official binaries&lt;/a&gt; if you use the matching options, i.e. DLL with the correct version-dependent compiler prefix, but if you prefer to use another configuration, for example a static library build of wxWidgets, you can easily build it using the solution files for MSVS 2011 and 2013 which are now also provided (and will be included in the upcoming 3.0.1 release) thanks to the contribution from Artur Wieczorek.&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>Google Summer of Code 2014</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2014/02/google-summer-of-code-2014/\"/>   <updated>2014-02-25T00:00:00-07:00</updated>   <id>/news/2014/02/google-summer-of-code-2014</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The wxWidgets project has been accepted for participation in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code 2014&lt;/a&gt; program which allows students to work on open source projects during the summer and be paid for it. We propose a number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wxwidgets.org/gsoc/projects/&quot;&gt;project ideas&lt;/a&gt; this summer but are also open to other suggestions, please see our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wxwidgets.org/gsoc/&quot;&gt;GSoC page&lt;/a&gt; for more information about this program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is a great opportunity both for the students and wxWidgets and we hope to see many applications this year. Please help to spread the word and encourage any motivated students you know to apply (or apply yourself if you can, of course)!&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>New Official Website Launched</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2014/02/new-official-website-launched/\"/>   <updated>2014-02-10T00:00:00-07:00</updated>   <id>/news/2014/02/new-official-website-launched</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re proud to announce a fresh new look for the official wxWidgets website for the first time in nearly 8 years!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some of the highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Responsive design making the website available to mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Utilizes &lt;a href=&quot;http://getbootstrap.com/&quot;&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt; for easy skinning.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Now built on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; replacing PyMeld.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Allows for comments on news posts (let us know what you think!)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Most content is authored in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; format.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Updates to the site can now be submitted to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wxWidgets/website&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve refreshed and reorganized content on many pages throughout the entire website, so be sure to really explore.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For those familiar with Bootstrap, you might notice that we&#39;re still using the default styles. If you know a talented web designer, we&#39;d still love to see some new styles that would really make the site unique. We&#39;re even managing all site styles using &lt;a href=&quot;http://lesscss.org/&quot;&gt;LESS&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;re pretty pleased with how much better it looks already though (and obviously enough to launch the new website as-is).&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>wxWidgets 3.0.0 Released</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2013/11/wxwidgets-3-0-0-released/\"/>   <updated>2013-11-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>   <id>/news/2013/11/wxwidgets-3-0-0-released</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;The final version of wxWidgets 3.0, the first new stable wxWidgets release in years and the first new major release since 1998, is now available. Please download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.0/&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/3.0.0/binaries/&quot;&gt;binaries&lt;/a&gt; for the selected Windows compilers (Microsoft Visual C++ and &lt;a href=&quot;http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/&quot;&gt;MinGW-TDM&lt;/a&gt;) from SourceForge or our &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.wxwidgets.org/pub/3.0.0/&quot;&gt;FTP mirror&lt;/a&gt;. As usual, the release files contain the sources and the documentation for the library in Unix (.tar.bz2) and Windows (.zip or .7z, with the latter being significantly smaller) formats. Notice that the documentation is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0.0/&quot;&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--more--&gt;   &lt;p&gt;3.0 release is a culmination of several years of work since 2.8 and so brings many important improvements compared to the old stable series, such as more transparent support for Unicode that&#39;s easier to use, the new wxOSX/Cocoa port, suitable for development of 64 bit GUI applications under OS X, and support for GTK+ 3 in wxGTK port, as well as a huge number of other new features and bug fixes which are too numerous to be listed here, so please refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/3.0.0/changes.txt&quot;&gt;change log&lt;/a&gt; for the full list. And if you&#39;re upgrading from a previous version, please pay special attention to the &quot;incompatible changes&quot; section of this file and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0.0/overview_changes_since28.html&quot;&gt;changes chapter&lt;/a&gt; of the manual for even more details.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We hope you will enjoy using the latest and greatest version of wxWidgets! And if not, there is always the possibility to &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.wxwidgets.org/newticket&quot;&gt;report bugs&lt;/a&gt; in it on our bug tracker. Have fun and good luck!&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>wxWidgets 2.9.5 Released</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2013/07/wxwidgets-2-9-5-released/\"/>   <updated>2013-07-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated>   <id>/news/2013/07/wxwidgets-2-9-5-released</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;wxWidgets 2.9.5 has been officially released. It is available right now from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/2.9.4/&quot;&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href=&quot;ftp://ftp.wxwidgets.org/pub/2.9.5/&quot;&gt;FTP mirror&lt;/a&gt; and, as usual, contain the sources and the documentation in Unix (.tar.bz2) and Windows (.zip or .7z, with the latter being significantly smaller) formats. Continuing the experiment started with 2.9.4, we also provide the pre-built &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/2.9.5/binaries/&quot;&gt;binaries&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft Visual C++ 2008, 2010 and 2012 users.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--more--&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.5/changes.txt&quot;&gt;the change log&lt;/a&gt; if you&#39;re upgrading from a previous version. And please see &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.wxwidgets.org/2.9.5/&quot;&gt;online documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The 2.9 series bring many improvements compared to 2.8 series such as much better and simpler to use support for Unicode and the new wxOSX/Cocoa port, suitable for development of 64 bit GUI applications under OS X, as well as a huge number of other new features and bug fixes. This release should be the last one before the 3.0 release planned soon, so testing it is even more important than usual. Please do download it, build your applications with it and &lt;a href=&quot;http://trac.wxwidgets.org/newticket&quot;&gt;report bugs&lt;/a&gt; if anything doesn&#39;t work correctly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Also notice that while this is still officially a development release, we consider it to be stable enough to be used in production environment and using it is strongly recommended for any new projects for which compatibility with the previous 2.8 is not important. As for the existing projects, please try them out with 2.9.5 as this is the last chance to fix any compatibility problems before 3.0.&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>wxCrafter 1.1 Plugin for CodeLite Released</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2013/03/wxcrafter-codelite-plugin-update/\"/>   <updated>2013-03-28T00:00:00-06:00</updated>   <id>/news/2013/03/wxcrafter-codelite-plugin-update</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wxcrafter.codelite.org/&quot;&gt;wxCrafter&lt;/a&gt; is a RAD plugin for developing wxWidgets applications using &lt;a href=&quot;http://codelite.org/&quot;&gt;CodeLite IDE&lt;/a&gt;.

It is available right now from &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/2.9.4/&quot;&gt;SourceForge&lt;/a&gt;. Notice that for the first time we experimentally make available not only the sources for this release, but also the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/downloads/wxwindows/2.9.4/binaries/&quot;&gt;binaries&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft Visual C++ users.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;!--more--&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Please read &lt;a href=&quot;https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxwindows/files/2.9.4/changes.txt&quot;&gt;the change log&lt;/a&gt; if you&#39;re upgrading from a previous version.

Compared to the previous 2.9.3 release, the most important change in this release is beta-level support for GTK+ 3 in wxGTK port. Mostly, the focus of this release is, however, on bug fixes in preparation for 3.0. In particular, a lot of improvements have been done in wxOSX/Cocoa port.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While this is still officially a development release because some API details are still not frozen, we believe that 2.9.4 can be used in production environment, especially for the new projects for which (small) changes in behaviour since 2.8 are not a problem.

Considering that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; desktop client is also written in wxPython it could be taken as a proof that wxWidgets provides a solid foundation for cloud-based systems!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And as Google Drive application uses wxWidgets 2.9.3, it should hopefully help answering the often-asked question if 2.9 series is good enough for production use.&lt;/p&gt; </content>  </entry>    <entry>   <title>wxWidgets for Android Campaign</title>   <link href=\"https://www.wxwidgets.org/news/2012/05/wxwidgets-for-android-campaign/\"/>   <updated>2012-05-02T12:30:00-06:00</updated>   <id>/news/2012/05/wxwidgets-for-android-campaign</id>   <content type=\"html\">&lt;p&gt;We are looking for developers and/or funding to help us with developing wxAndroid port.
