This partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states protects more than one million acres of estuarine land and water, which provides essential habitat for wildlife; offers educational opportunities for students, teachers and the public; and serves as living laboratories for scientists.  NOAA provides funding, national guidance, and technical assistance.  Each reserve is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners. NERR System Wide Monitoring Project (SWMP) The National Estuarine Research Reserve System-wide Monitoring Program tracks short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine waters to understand how human activities and natural events can change ecosystems. It provides valuable long-term data on water quality, water nutrient levels, and weather at frequent time intervals.  Coastal managers use this monitoring data to make informed decisions on local and regional issues, such as &#x93;no-discharge&#x94; zones for boats and measuring the success of restoration projects.  The reserve system currently measures physical and chemical water quality indicators, nutrients and the impacts of weather on estuaries.  As the program expands, plans include adding a biological monitoring component and tracking changes in land use through remote sensing. North Inlet &#x95; Winyah Bay Reserve&#x92;s Weather Monitoring Program The North Inlet Estuary and the adjacent lower northeastern section of Winyah Bay Estuary were designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System in 1992.   The North Inlet - Winyah Bay (NIW) Reserve is managed/hosted by the University of South Carolina, Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory.  Its environmental monitoring program began running under the auspices of the NERR program in June 1993.  In 1995, the NERR program began a System-Wide Monitoring Program that set protocols for monitoring the estuarine environment, starting with water quality.  Collection protocols for weather data were being developed and implemented in 1997, at which time the NIW reserve&#x92;s data collection procedures changed to follow these new guidelines.  Official SWMP weather protocols were implemented in 2001.  Weather data collected under the NERR program are a continuation of the Baruch Institute&#x92;s long-term meteorological data set, which began in 1982, with rainfall data extending back into 1978. The NIW NERR weather station is located at the end of the Oyster Landing pier.  The station includes sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active solar radiation (PAR, collected by a LiCor Quantum sensor), barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation (Eppley black and white pyranometer, wavelengths between 280 and 2800 nm), and precipitation.  All sensors are located on an aluminum tower at a height of approximately 3.5 meters (with the exception of the rain gauge, which is adjacent to the boardwalk) and are wired into a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger.  The data logger program, provided by the NERR Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO), determines and implements the data collection schedule.  Readings are taken every 5 seconds continuously throughout the year and various average, instantaneous, and total data are reported for 15-minute, hourly, and 24-hour time intervals.  Over the course of this database, there were protocol changes in data collection and reporting.  See the Supplemental Information section (below) for some general information, the Completeness Report and the &#x93;NERRMET.MissingAnomalous.2000-2004&#x94; document for more detailed information, and the Field Methodology Description for a complete data collection schedule. </abstract> <purpose>The principal objective of this dataset is to monitor and archive meteorological data for the North Inlet - Winyah Bay NERR in order to observe environmental variability, changes, or trends over time; for use in short and long-term studies at North Inlet; for comparisons to other NERR sites; and to compliment other biological, chemical, and physical research conducted throughout the reserve.  As part of the NERR System-wide monitoring program, this information will also contribute to effective national, regional, and site specific coastal zone management.</purpose> <supplinf> Data Collection and Reporting This metadata document pertains to the NIW NERR Weather data for the years 2000-2004.  However, this metadata document and the data it accompanies are Baruch&#x92;s version and may differ from the NIW NERR CDMO versions.  Some important differences in the datasets are as follows: 1.  Data and FGDC metadata for the year 2000 are reported in Baruch&#x92;s dataset or are available through the NIW NERR Weather Technician.  They are not reported as part of the SWMP Weather Database by the CDMO. 2.  Eppley Solar Radiation data from January 1, 2000 through October 21, 2003 are reported (as instantaneous readings) in Baruch&#x92;s dataset or are available through the NIW NERR Weather Technician, but are not reported as part of the SWMP Weather Database by the CDMO.  On October 21, 2003 the CR10X version 4.0 program was implemented and the CDMO began reporting Eppley Solar Radiation data (total readings) as a non-required component of SWMP. 3.  A major data collection protocol change was instituted on October 21, 2003.  This change resulted in several differences in the values reported (instantaneous readings to averages or totals, etc) as well as the reporting format.  Please see the various data collection schedules as reported in the methodology section of this document for more information. Other NIW NERR SWMP Datasets: NIW NERR Nutrient:  Water samples were collected from four sites within the North Inlet and Winyah Bay Estuaries every 20 days, at 2 hour and 4 minute intervals, for 2 complete tidal cycles (26 hours).  Samples were obtained with an ISCO automated water sampler at a depth of 0.5 meters below the water&#x92;s surface.  The samples were then analyzed in the lab for numerous parameters including:  salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate-nitrite, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen), phosphorus (total and dissolved, ortho phosphate), dissolved organic carbon, suspended sediment (total suspended sediment, inorganic suspended sediment, organic suspended sediment), and suspended sediment color.  Tide stage based on published NOAA tide charts is also available.  Parameters changed throughout the database, limited parameters beginning in January of 2002 are available from the CDMO (http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/) and the complete database (called NERR Water Chemistry) is available through Baruch&#x92;s Data Management Office (http://links.baruch.sc.edu/Data/) beginning in June of 1993.  Baruch&#x92;s LTER Water Chemistry (LTERDWS) database is a precursor to this database and reports some preliminary data from as early as 1978.  Daily data from 3 sites, including most of the parameters listed above, where reported by 1981 and through June of 1993. NIW NERR Water Quality:  Water quality data are collected via an automated datalogger from four sites within the North Inlet and Winyah Bay Estuaries at 30 minute intervals.  Parameters include:  water temperature, specific conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen (percent saturation and milligrams/Liter), depth, pH, and turbidity.  NIW NERR Water Quality data are available from the CDMO (http://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/) beginning in January of 1995.  Water Quality data were collected under the auspices of the NERR program beginning in October of 1993; these earlier data are available through Baruch&#x92;s Data Management Office (http://links.baruch.sc.edu/Data/).  In addition, water quality data are available beginning in 1982 in Baruch&#x92;s LTER Meteorological database with water parameters (LTERMET). </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20000101</begdate> <enddate>20041231</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Ground condition.</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update> As needed </update> </status> <spdom> <descgeog> The NIW NERR is located on the Southeastern Atlantic coast of the United States and includes two tidal estuaries, North Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, located directly east of the uplands of Hobcaw Barony (also known as the Belle W. Baruch Property) and approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type estuary (Pritchard, 1955).  It is composed of numerous winding tidal creeks and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine forest, a golf course, and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955) and composed of waters that originate in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km south of North Inlet.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes. The Oyster Landing (OL) meteorological monitoring site, located at -79.1928 W, 33.3494 N, is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area.  The weather station is located on an aluminum tower, approximately 3.5 meters in height, at the end of the OL pier.  This is also the location of one of the NIW NERR water quality and nutrient stations.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of Crabhaul Creek in the mid western portion of North Inlet.  The sampling site is located approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of Crabhaul Creek.  The creek directly drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0 - 32 ppt. and average tidal range is approximately 1.4 meters.  The creek has an average depth of approximately 2 meters Mean High Water (MHW) and average width of approximately 150 meters MHW.  The bottom is comprised mostly of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus. Pritchard, D.W. 1955. Estuarine circulation patterns. Proc. Am. Soc. Civ. Eng. 81(717):1-11.

The number of decimal places published in the final database is meant to best represent the precision and accuracy of the data.  Raw data are archived on CD and Baruch&#x92;s Server as part of the complete NERRMET database archival, but are not recommended for use.  Please contact the NIW NERR Weather Technician or Baruch&#x92;s Data Manager (contact info at the end of this document) for more information on reporting accuracy or to obtain these data in their raw format. Date:  The date values are integers and have no decimal places assigned to them, they are accurate to the whole number. Julian Day:  The Julian Day values are integers and have no decimal places assigned to them, they are accurate to the whole number. Time:  The time values are integers and have no decimal places assigned to them.  Time is generally considered to be accurate to within 5 minutes. Air Temperature (all parameters):  Based on the accuracy of both sensors used (&amp;plusmn; 0.2&#xB0;C and &amp;plusmn; 0.4&#xB0;C), it was determined that a number in the hundredths place would not be appropriate.  Values were rounded to the nearest 10th (1 decimal place). Relative Humidity (all parameters):  Based on the accuracy of both sensors used (&amp;plusmn; 3% RH at 90-100% RH) and the uncertainty of calibration (&amp;plusmn;1.2% RH), it was determined that a number in the tenths place would not be appropriate.  Values were rounded to the nearest whole number. Barometric Pressure (all parameters):  Based on the accuracy of the sensor (&amp;plusmn; 2mb between 0&#xB0;C and 40&#xB0;C, higher at more extreme temperatures), it was determined that a number in the tenths place would not be appropriate.  Values were rounded to the nearest whole number. Wind Speed (all parameters):  Based on the thresholds (0.4 and 0.5 m/s) and accuracies (&amp;plusmn; 2% and &amp;plusmn; 1.1% of readings) of the sensors used, it was determined that a number in the hundredths place would not be appropriate.  Values were rounded to the nearest 10th (1 decimal place). Wind Direction:  Based on the accuracies (&amp;plusmn; 5&#xB0; and &amp;plusmn; 4&#xB0;) of the sensors used, it was determined that a number in the tenths place would not be appropriate.  Values were rounded to the nearest whole number. Rain:  Based on the accuracies (&amp;plusmn; 1.0% at 2inches/hr and &amp;plusmn; 1.0% at up to 1 inch/hr) and the minimum amount of rain recorded by the sensor (0.25mm), it was determined that a number in the hundredths place would not be appropriate.  Values were rounded to the nearest 10th (1 decimal place). Total Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR):  Based on the uncertainty of calibration (to within 5% of full range) and the range of measurement (0-2000) of the LiCor Quantum Sensor, an error of 100 millimoles/M2 is possible in the calibration process.  An expert in the field of solar radiation (Jim Morris, Univ. of South Carolina) recommended that reporting values with one decimal place would be more than sufficient for research use.  Values were rounded to the nearest 10th (1 decimal place). Voltage:  voltage is reported as a tool to gauge battery power to the weather station only.  It is reported in volts with one decimal place. Solar Radiation (Instantaneous):  Based on the uncertainty of calibration (to within &amp;plusmn; 1%), the linearity (&amp;plusmn; 1% from 0 to 2.008 Langleys/min), and the range of measurement (0-2) of the Eppley Pyranometer, it was determined that a number in the thousandths place could still be valuable.  An expert in the field of solar radiation (Jim Morris, Univ. of South Carolina), recommended that three decimal places be maintained in the final data set.  Values were rounded to the nearest 1000th (3 decimal places). Total Solar Radiation:  Based on the uncertainty of calibration (to within &amp;plusmn; 1%) and the linearity (&amp;plusmn; 1% from 0 to 2.008 Langleys/min) of the Eppley Pyranometer, as well as the range of measurement for a 15-minute versus 24-hour period (measurements range from 0 to 8,000+), it was determined that retaining 1 decimal place was most appropriate for the final dataset.  This reporting accuracy was recommended/approved by Robert W. Scarborough, SWMP Oversight Committee Chair and Delaware NERR Research Coordinator.  The National Climatic Data Center reports hourly totals for solar radiation in Langleys with one decimal place as well.  (Some users may be interested in retaining 2 decimal places for the 15-minute data &#x95; these data are available through the NIW NERR Weather Technician or Baruch&#x92;s Data Manager) </attracce> </qattracc> </attracc> <logic> not applicable </logic> <complete> The NIW NERR Weather Technician, CDMO Weather Data Analyst, and 2006 Data Rescue Manager verified the data files.  Specific data availability information may be found in the &#x93;NERRMET.MissingAnomalous.2000-2004&#x94; document, a separate file archived along with this Metadata document, as part of the final dataset documentation.  The &#x93;NERRMET.MissinAnomalous.2000-2004&#x94; document identifies data that are missing from the dataset, erroneous data that were deleted by the NIW NERR Weather Technician or 2006 Data Rescue Manager, and data that were designated as questionable or anomalous.  This documentation pertains only to Baruch&#x92;s final published dataset, and may differ from NIW NERR/CDMO versions of the database.  All occurrences of missing or deleted data were marked with a period (.) in the final dataset.  Data that have been removed or edited in the final dataset are still present in unedited and/or raw data files.  The &#x93;NERRMET.MissingAnomalous.2000-2004&#x94; document is archived along with the final data, graphics, and documentation on CD and Baruch&#x92;s Server.  It is also published online at http://links.baruch.sc.edu/data/ and in the NERRMET 2000-2004 Project Notebook located onsite at the Baruch Marine Lab.  Excerpts from the Missing/Anomalous Document containing important general information are included below: All Parameters Users should be aware that data values may not have been collected over the entire relevant time period or be based on all the expected 5-second data.  Problems with the weather station data collection, maintenance, or power outages may result in missing data; but, for example, an hourly average isn&#x92;t necessarily deleted from the database simply because a few 5-second data are missing.  Also, precipitation, PAR (LiCor), and later Solar Radiation parameters are total values (rather than averages) and are often left in the dataset despite not being based on the entire relevant time period (totals may be incomplete).  If a &#x93;significant&#x94; portion of the data comprising a time interval was missing, protocol called for the time interval&#x92;s calculated value to be deleted as well.  In general, decisions to leave data in the dataset were made at the NERR Technician&#x92;s discretion; the 2006 Data Rescue Manager did not attempt to determine the validity of these values, as the NERR Technician had a much better grasp of the situation at the time that the decision was made.  It is the user&#x92;s responsibility to examine the missing, deleted, and anomalous data reports to ensure that average and total data were collected/calculated to their standards. Relative Humidity For relative humidity data from 01/01/2000 through 05/15/2003, all measured values greater than 100% were altered by the CR10X datalogger program to read 100% in the raw data.  Readings greater than 100% could indicate a sensor malfunction, calibration problems that should be addressed, normal measurement error, or super saturated air.  Because these values were manipulated in the raw data, it was impossible for the NERR Tech or Data Managers to determine whether they were valid data points.  On 4/17/2002, Baruch&#x92;s data managers met with representatives from the Southeastern Regional Climate Center of the South Carolina DNR, representatives from the CDMO, and two NERR technicians to discuss this and other matters.  As a result of this meeting, a formal recommendation was made to the CDMO to cease the manipulation of these values at the data collection level (raw data) and to instead handle the matter at the data management editing level where informed decisions can be made and documented.  The CDMO and the Data Management Committee reviewed the recommendation, agreed with it, and began implementing it in May of 2003. In addition, the sensor that was in use from 08/11/1999 through 05/16/01 seemed to have slightly lower readings than would be expected, and they should be considered questionable as a result.  When it was installed, there was a marked difference in the readings from the previous sensor.  Maximum readings were around 97 or 98% as opposed to 100%, which was standard for the previous sensor and the climate in this area.  When the sensor was replaced on 05/16/01, the readings returned to the previous and expected range. Wind Speed From 01/01/2000 through 05/16/2001, the wind speed sensor offset number (0.2) for the sensor in use (03001-5 Wind Sentry) showed up as a reading whenever there was no wind, and potentially, when the sensor was malfunctioning.  There are no reported zero wind speed readings for this time period; the lowest reported value is 0.2.  The offset number is the threshold from which the sensor can first recognize wind and, when it appears erroneously (through CR10X programming or sensor error) in the data, it represents a zero.  Values of 0.2 in the data should be treated with caution as they may actually result from a measurement taken when there was either no wind or too little for the sensor to measure.  The NIW NERR and 2006 Data Rescue Manager did not find any specific instances during this time where the offset value was present as a reading when the sensor was malfunctioning.  The sensor measured in increments of 0.15, and only one decimal place was retained, so after the offset number, readings appear in the data as 0.3 (0.30), 0.5 (0.45), 0.6 (0.60), 0.8 (0.75), 0.9 (0.90). Starting on 05/17/2001, when the new Met One sensor was installed, the CR10X datalogger program was altered to record a wind speed of zero (instead of the offset number) if there was no wind.  However, since the lowest recorded reading is the offset number, and this number was changed to zero by the datalogger program, the next lowest reading that is present in the data is equal to the offset number (0.2811) plus 0.16, the increment that the sensor measures in.  Therefore, the measurements begin at zero, jump to 0.4 (0.44), and then continue on as 0.6 (0.60), 0.8 (0.76), 0.9 (0.92), etc.  If the sensor changes and the offset number and/or increment of measurement change, the recorded measurements would change accordingly. On 10/21/2003 the datalogger program for wind speed changed yet again.  Beginning on 10/21/2003 and through 12/31/2004, zero wind speed readings were no longer recorded.  The 03001-5 Wind Sentry sensor was in use and the offset number (0.2) was once again recorded when there was no wind or when the wind speed was less than the sensor&#x92;s threshold.  Values of 0.2 in the data should be treated with caution (see above).  It is unclear what the increment of measurement was for this period, but with one decimal place retained, readings progress normally. Wind Direction Wind directions were recorded whether or not there was a measurable wind speed.  As mentioned above, from 01/01/2000 &#x95; 03/16/2001 and from 10/21/2003 &#x95; 12/31/2004, there were no zero wind speed readings and the wind speed offset number was reported as a reading instead.  Users should be cautious of both 15-minute instantaneous wind direction readings taken when the wind speed was recorded as zero and when the offset number was recorded as a wind speed.  These may not be true direction readings as there was no measurable wind speed at the time.  Average wind directions may also include direction readings taken when there was no measurable wind speed. PAR (LiCor) The LiCor PAR sensor has been in use throughout the NIW NERR MET data sets, which began in 1997.  However, PAR data were not reported in the final dataset until 06/26/2001 as a result of various problems with the data.  For documentation on earlier PAR data, please see the NERR MET 1997-1999 database documentation.  For the purposes of this database, an explanation of PAR data problems is as follows. On 04/19/2000 a new LiCor sensor was installed in a new location on the weather station.  The sensor was moved, from a location next to the tipping bucket rain gauge to the top of the storage box on the pier, because it was possible that it was being shaded for a portion of the day (per conversation with Baruch Data Manager, Ginger Ogburn-Matthews, no written documentation).  After this move, there was a large increase in the PAR recorded.  Because of this large discrepancy in the readings, it was determined that the sensor probably was being shaded, that the effect on the readings was both evident and substantial, and that there was no way to rescue the data.  The readings during this time period were also extremely erratic and often out of the expected range for a 15-minute total.  There appeared to be changes made to the program, in an attempt to correct these readings, which affected the data and were not documented.  In addition, the old sensor had a cracked/corroded cable that may have been causing problems.  As a result, these data were designated as completely unreliable and all PAR data were deleted from 01/01/2000 to 04/19/2000.  (It should be noted that the sensor location was changed yet again on 12/14/2000.  It was moved off of the top of the storage cabinet (on the platform) to the southeast corner piling of the floating dock (off of the platform)). Unfortunately, the multiplier (specific to sensor/calibration) was never changed in the CR10X datalogger program when the new sensor was installed on 04/19/2000.  There was a multiplier change and sensor test on 4/24/2000 (noted in the NERR Tech&#x92;s &#x93;Other remarks&#x94; section of the NERR metadata), but it appears that it was still incorrect and the change was not specified or documented in the CR10X program.  The sensor was recalibrated in March of 2001 (no documentation for exact date), but again the multiplier wasn&#x92;t corrected.  The error was discovered and the multiplier was finally corrected for the sensor in use on 04/03/2002. The NERR Data Technician was able to go back and correct data beginning on 06/26/2001 (through 04/03/2002) for the multiplier that should have been used at that time.  Data recorded prior to June 26 couldn&#x92;t be corrected because of incomplete documentation.  While the incorrect multiplier may have accounted for some of the large discrepancy noticed after the sensor location was moved, it is unlikely that all of the issues described above were a result; pre-4/19/2000 data are still believed to be unreliable. In addition, for PAR data from 01/01/2000 through 10/21/2003 all measured values less than zero were altered by the CR10X datalogger program to read zero in the raw data.  Values less than zero could indicate a sensor malfunction, calibration problems that should be addressed, normal measurement error, or an incorrect multiplier.  Because these values were manipulated in the raw data, it was impossible for the NERR Tech or Data Managers to determine whether they were valid data points.  On 04/17/2002, Baruch&#x92;s data managers met with representatives from the Southeastern Regional Climate Center of the South Carolina DNR, representatives from the CDMO, and two NERR technicians to discuss this and other matters.  As a result of this meeting, a formal recommendation was made to the CDMO to cease the manipulation of these values at the data collection level (raw data) and to instead handle the matter at the data management editing level where informed decisions can be made and documented.  The CDMO and the Data Management Committee reviewed the recommendation, agreed with it, and began implementing it in October of 2003. Finally, users should be aware that because this is a total parameter, small negative values recorded in the 5-second data that are within the expected error range of the sensor are summed to attain 15-minute, hourly, and 24-hour totals.  15-minute and hourly totals may show larger than expected negative values as a result. Solar Radiation (Eppley) From 01/01/2000 through 10/21/2003, solar radiation data are available as 15-minute instantaneous readings reported in Langleys/minute.  These data were not reported in the NIW NERR/CDMO version of the dataset.  The 2006 Data Rescue Manager merged the archived NIW NERR solar radiation data with the rest of the dataset for the purposes of this data publication.  Beginning on 10/21/2003, this parameter was changed to Total Solar Radiation and included in the NIW NERR/CDMO version of the dataset. Total Solar Radiation (Eppley) Total Solar Radiation, reported in Langleys, was reported for 15-minute, hourly, and 24-hour time intervals beginning on 10/21/2003.  Users should be aware that because this is a total parameter, small negative values recorded in the 5-second data that are within the expected error range of the sensor are summed to attain 15-minute, hourly, and 24-hour totals.  15-minute and hourly totals may show larger than expected negative values as a result. </complete> <lineage> <method> <methtype>Field Collection Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Meteorological Data Field Collection Protocol The Oyster Landing weather station is located at the end of an 800-foot pier ending in Crab Haul Creek.  Sensors are located on and around a 3.5 meter high weather tower and wired to a Campbell Scientific CR10X datalogger according to CDMO and manufacturer&#x92;s protocols.  The CR10X controls the sensors via a datalogger program supplied by the CDMO and samples every 5-seconds throughout the year.  Data collection schedules over the course of this database are as follows: Data Collection Schedules: &gt;December 01, 2000 &#x95; October 21, 2003: &gt; &gt;15-minute Data (arrays 150, 151, 112): &gt;    - Instantaneous Readings:  Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed, &gt;        Wind Direction, Solar Radiation &gt;    - Totals:  Precipitation, PAR &gt;Hourly Data (arrays 101, 102, 103, 104, 105): &gt;    - Averages from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, &gt;        Wind Speed, Wind Direction &gt;    - Totals:  Precipitation, PAR &gt;24-Hour Data (arrays 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246): &gt;    - Averages from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, &gt;        Wind Speed, Wind Direction &gt;    - Maximum, Minimum, and their times from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative &gt;        Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed &gt;    - Wind Direction Standard Deviation from 5-second data &gt;    - Totals:  Precipitation, PAR &gt; &gt;October 21, 2003 &#x95; 12/31/2004: &gt; &gt;15-minute Data (array 15): &gt;   - Averages from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, &gt;       Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Battery Voltage &gt;   - Maximum, Minimum, and their times from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative &gt;       Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed &gt;   - Wind Direction Standard Deviation from 5-second data &gt;   - Totals:  Precipitation, Solar Radiation, PAR &gt;Hourly Data (array 60): &gt;   - Averages from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, &gt;       Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Battery Voltage &gt;   - Maximum, Minimum, and their times from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative &gt;       Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed &gt;   - Wind Direction Standard Deviation from 5-second data &gt;   - Totals:  Precipitation, Solar Radiation, PAR &gt;24-Hour Data (array 144): &gt;   - Averages from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, Relative Humidity, Barometric &gt;       Pressure, Wind Speed, Wind Direction, Battery Voltage &gt;   - Maximum, Minimum, and their times from 5-second data:  Air Temperature, &gt;        Relative Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed &gt;   - Wind Direction Standard Deviation from 5-second data &gt;   - Totals:  Precipitation, Solar Radiation, PAR The CR10X datalogger converts 5-second data into the appropriate output (15-minute instantaneous reading or average, hourly average, maximum, etc.).  5-second data are retained until available memory on the CR10X is full and then overwritten (ring-memory) and discarded.  PC208W software, located on the NERR Weather Computer in the System Wide Monitoring Lab at the NIW NERR Building, interfaces with the CR10X to upload data via short haul modem approximately every 15 minutes.  This data is archived in monthly raw comma delimited (.DAT) data files on the NERR Weather Computer and the BMFL Server. Both the sensors comprising the weather station and the datalogger program controlling them have changed multiple times over the course of the database.  Sensors are changed out for recalibration or repair and sensor-specific multipliers are changed within the datalogger program as a result.  The sensors and their dates of use are detailed in the Data Quality/Accuracy section of this metadata document.  Calibration information, multipliers, and offset values are carefully documented by the NERR Weather Technician and documentation is maintained onsite at the NIW NERR Building.  Data collection protocol changes have also resulted in program and data reporting changes.  The Supplemental Information portion of this metadata document and the Missing and Anomalous Data Document (separate file) detail any changes that may have affected the dataset. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>National Estuarine Research Reserve System, Centralized Data Management Office</origin> <origin>Belle W.

The WDMP was developed in Visual Basic to interface with the NERRS data collection schedule.  It automatically input and converted the monthly raw data files into an Access database.  Then the WDMP checked the data against a predetermined set of error criteria (detailed below) and produced error and summary reports.  Any anomalous or erroneous data flagged by the WDMP were then investigated by the NERR Technician and the determination (reasonable/suspect) or action taken (correction/deletion) was documented.  11111, 55555, and 99999 codes were used to designate (as placeholders) missing, erroneous, and deleted data. Error/Anomalous Data Criteria 01/01/2000 &#x95; 10/21/2003: &gt;Air Temp: &gt;   15 min sample not greater than max for the day &gt;   15 min sample not less than the min for the day &gt;   15 min sample not greater than 3.0 ( C ) from the previous 15 minutes &gt;   Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day &gt;   1 hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the hour &gt;Relative Humidity: &gt;   Not changed by more than 25% from the previous 15 minutes &gt;   Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day &gt;   1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the hour &gt;Precipitation: &gt;   Precipitation not greater than 5 mm in 15 min &gt;   No precipitation for the month &gt;Wind Speed: &gt;   Wind speed greater than 30 m/s &gt;   Wind speed less than 0.5 m/s &gt;Wind Direction: &gt;   Wind direction not greater than 360 degrees &gt;   Wind direction not less than 0 &gt;Pressure: &gt;   Pressure greater than 1040 mb or less than 980 mb &gt;   Pressure changes greater than 5 mb per hour &gt;   Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day &gt;   1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the hour &gt;Time: &gt;   15-minute interval &gt;   60-minute interval &gt;   1440-minute interval &gt;Date: &gt;   Year &gt;   Julian Date &gt;For all data: &gt;   Duplicate interval data Beginning October 21, 2003, comma-delimited monthly files were opened in Microsoft Excel and pre-processed using the EQWin format Macro provided by the CDMO.  This Macro reformats header columns, inserts stations codes and a date column, corrects the time column format, and formats the data to the appropriate number of decimal places.  The pre-processed file is then ready to be copied into the EQWin weather.eqi file where the data are QA/QC&#x92;d (criteria detailed below) and archived.  EQWin queries, reports and graphs are used to discover dataset outliers and large changes in the data.  EQWin is also used to generate statistics, view graphs; create customized queries and reports; cross query the water, weather, and nutrient data; and finally export the data to the CDMO. Error/Anomalous Data Criteria 10/21/2003 &#x95; 12/31/2004: &gt;Air Temp: &gt;   15 min sample not greater than max for the day &gt;   15 min sample not less than the min for the day &gt;   15 min sample not greater than 3.0 (oC) from the previous 15 minutes &gt;    Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day &gt;   1 hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the hour &gt;Relative Humidity: &gt;   Not changed by more than 25% from the previous 15 minutes &gt;   Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day &gt;   1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the hour &gt;Rainfall: &gt;   Precipitation not greater than 5 mm in 15 min &gt;   No precipitation for the month &gt;Wind Speed: &gt;   Wind speed greater than 65 m/s &gt;   Wind speed less than .5 m/s &gt;Wind Direction: &gt;   Wind direction not greater than 360 degrees &gt;   Wind direction not less than 0 degrees &gt;Pressure: &gt;   Pressure greater than 1040 mb or less than 980 mb &gt;   Pressure changes greater than 5 mb per hour &gt;   Maximum and minimum values recorded for the day &gt;   1-hour average not greater than 10% above the greatest 15 min sample recorded in the hour &gt;Time: &gt;   15-minute interval &gt;   60-minute interval &gt;   1440-minute interval &gt;Date: &gt;   Year &gt;   Julian Date &gt;For all data: &gt;   Duplicate interval data In order to maintain the continuity of the database after the new data collection procedures instituted on October 21, 2003, all weather data collected with earlier versions of the CR10X program (12 array output) were reformatted by the CDMO for compatibility (new 3 array output).  As part of this process, all 11111, 55555, and 99999 coded placeholders were deleted from the spreadsheets and the cells were left blank.  Data for years 2000 through 2003 were then run through the EQWin program.  The 2000 data were not run through EQWin or made available online through the CDMO website. 2006 Data Rescue Process Description The 2006 Data Rescue Manager obtained all posted final data and metadata files from the CDMO and the NIW NERR Weather Technician, and all raw and process data files from the NIW NERR Technician.  Yearly data files were imported into Microsoft Excel (from tab delimited text files).  Each yearly file was sorted by array number and separate worksheets were created within a yearly workbook for 15-minute, hourly, and 24-Hour data.  Missing data denoted by an empty cell in the spreadsheet were marked with a period &#x93;.&#x94; as placeholder.  All 55555, 11111, and 99999 codes that were mistakenly left in the dataset were removed and replaced with missing data markers.  For data prior to 10/21/2003, an additional column for solar radiation (Eppley) was added to the database, and 15-minute Eppley data obtained from the NIW NERR Technician were inserted.  For data beginning on 10/21/2003, the 2006 Data Rescue Manager determined that date/time rows did not appear throughout the database whenever the CR10X was powered off.  All of these instances were found and rows inserted with missing data markers for the missing data, so that the database would be complete. There were numerous incidences throughout the database, where missing 15-minute data for a &#x93;total&#x94; parameter (LiCor, Precip) resulted in zero values recorded in the hourly and 24-hour data (the program was totaling nothing to reach a value).  These zero values were found and replaced with missing data markers.  During a portion of the database (11/2002 &#x95; 10/21/2003) only rain events were recorded (nothing was entered when there was no rain) so a period with no rainfall was indistinguishable from missing data (both were represented by a blank cell in the spreadsheet).  The 2006 Data Rescue Manager filled in zeros for date/times with no documented missing precipitation data to complete the dataset. All data were QA/QC&#x92;d again by the 2006 Data Rescue Manager and verified using all forms of data documentation from the NIW NERR Technician and the CDMO.  In addition, graphics were created using hourly data and used to QA/QC the data for visible trends that might indicate sensor malfunctions or other problems with the data.  Missing, anomalous, and erroneous data documentation; changes made to the data; and relevant additional notations detailed in the CDMO metadata were combined with additional documentation made by the 2006 Data Rescue Manager and consolidated into one cohesive document.  All changes made to the NIW NERR CDMO version of the data by the 2006 Data Rescue Manager are detailed in this document.  It was titled &#x93;NERRMET.MissingAnomalous.2000-2004&#x94;, and the file was archived in .doc and .txt versions along with the rest of the final database. For 2000-2002, columns were added to the spreadsheets, and filled with missing data markers, to account for all parameters present after the October 21, 2003 data collection schedule change.  Column headings were revised and standardized, and each column was formatted for consistency and accuracy throughout the database. All final data and documentation files (including this document) were archived in the NERRMET.2000-2004.FINAL Directory on CD, Baruch&#x92;s Server, and Baruch&#x92;s website as part of the final, published database.  Hardcopies of both the metadata documents and final spreadsheets were printed for archival in the NERRMET 2000-2004 Notebook, which is maintained by Baruch&#x92;s Data Manager onsite at the Field Lab.  All raw and process data and documentation files were archived in the NERRMET.2000-2004 Raw and Process Directories on CD and Baruch&#x92;s Server. </procdesc> <procdate>20060331</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>North Inlet Estuary, which is part of Hobcaw Barony, is located in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA.</indspref> <direct>Point</direct> </spdoinfo> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover> Date = the month day and year that the reading was taken.
