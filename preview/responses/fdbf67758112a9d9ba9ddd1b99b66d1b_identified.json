The 1989 Immunization   Supplement provides 93 variables from the core Person File (see   NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY, 1989 [ICPSR 9583]), including sex,   age, race, marital status, veteran status, education, income, industry   and occupation codes, and limits on activity. The five variables unique   to this supplement offer information on vaccines received for   influenza, pneumonia, and tetanus, and when these immunizations were  administered.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1989\" cycle=\"P1\">1989</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1989\" cycle=\"P1\">1989</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Civilian noninstitutionalized population of the 50 states  and the District of Columbia.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    One person 18 years or older randomly sampled from each   household in the 1989 National Health Interview Survey sample. The NHIS   sample itself was a multistage probability sample from 1,924   geographically defined Primary Sampling Units (PSUs). Starting with an   all-area frame, a reduced number of 201 PSUs were selected, including   two from each nonself-representing stratum. Black persons were   oversampled. Four independent representative samples which may be used  in any combination were drawn.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to   these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><list type=\"bulleted\">  <itm>Standardized missing values.</itm>  </list>  </cleanOps>              </dataColl>       <notes>                 Per agreement with NCHS, ICPSR distributes the data   file(s) and technical documentation in this collection in their   original form as prepared by NCHS. The age distribution of the sample   was 18-54 years (N = 60,096), 55-64 years (N = 10,231), 65-74 years (N   = 8,618), and 75+ years (N = 5,627). The racial background was White (N   = 68,980), Black (N = 11,377), Asian/Pacific Islander (N = 1,892),   Native American (N = 593), multiple (N = 63), and other or unknown (N =  1,667).         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR09707.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                                   <restrctn>                                    In preparing the data tape(s) for this collection, the   National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has removed direct   identifiers and characteristics that might lead to identification of   data subjects. As an additional precaution, NCHS requires, under   section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242m), that   data collected by NCHS not be used for any purpose other than for   statistical analysis and reporting. NCHS further requires that analysts   not use the data to learn the identity of any persons or establishments   and that the director of NCHS be notified if any identities are   inadvertently discovered. ICPSR member institutions and other users  ordering data from ICPSR are expected to adhere to these restrictions.             </restrctn>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
