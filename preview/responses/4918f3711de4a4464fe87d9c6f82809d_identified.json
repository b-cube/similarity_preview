We will consider whether there exist nontrivial gluings such that for any embedding, the manifold M and its mutant have isomorphic Heegaard Floer homology. In particular, we will demonstrate that if h is not isotopic to the identity map, then there exists an embedding of S into a three-manifold M such that the rank of the non-torsion summands of HF-hat of M differs from that of its mutant. We will also show that if the gluing map is isotopic to neither the identity nor the genus-two hyperelliptic involution, then there exists an embedding of S into a three-manifold M such that the total rank of HF-hat of M differs from that of its mutant.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>",
