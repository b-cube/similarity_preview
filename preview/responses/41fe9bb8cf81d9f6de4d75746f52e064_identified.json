StreamNet uses this layer to reference fisheries and aquatic related data compiled across the Pacific Northwest Region. Routes are based on whole streams uniquely identified via the LLID attribute. The route system is measured in feet to the nearest integer. To distinguish this hydrography layer from previously used systems, StreamNet refers to it as Mixed-Scale Hydrography - version 3.1, or \"MSHv3.1\". At version 1: This dataset includes all routed streams present in the PNW River Reach Files (PNWRF3), StreamNet's original 1:100k base hydrography layer. In addition, those features within the state of Washington are depicted at a higher resolution (1:24k scale or finer) and densified to include all named streams present in and sourced from Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife's 1:24k+ hydrography layer along with additional unnamed streams from that source where fish data exists and is compiled across the region. At MSHv1, the extent of StreamNet's regional hydrography was expanded and integrated with the 1:100k scale routed hydrography for California (CalHydro). While the StreamNet project does not manage fish data for California, the integration of California hydrography facilitates collaboration with StreamNet's partner project, \"CalFISH\". For more information about the CalFISH project, visit http://www.CalFISH.org At version 2: All features within the state of Oregon are now also depicted at the higher resolution (1:24k+) based on linework provided by Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and originally sourced from the Pacific Northwest Hydrography Framework (PNWHF) dataset. For the most part, linework from this source is coincident with the High-Resolution (24k+) National Hydrography Dataset (HR-NHD). Version 3 and minor releases primarily capture additional streams as needed to reference fish data submitted by partners. Future versions of this dataset will incorporate higher resolution source linework within the states of Idaho and Montana with a trend toward using linework that is essentially coincident with that found in the HR-NHD.

For more information about the StreamNet Project, see the supplemental information section of this metadata record or visit http://www.StreamNet.org</abstract>       <purpose>The primary purpose of this dataset is to provide a whole-stream route system ideal for storing, organizing, and displaying stream related fisheries and habitat data across the Pacific Northwest and California at the best practically available source scale. An on-going effort involves improving the resolution of the source datasets that makeup this regional layer. In addition to providing a regionally standard linear referencing system, StreamNet's Mixed Scale Hydrography v3.1 (MSHv3.1) can support many different types of GIS analysis including: buffering around reaches, stream network routing, and basin characteristics analysis.</purpose>       <supplinf>StreamNet is a cooperative information management and dissemination project focused on fisheries and aquatic related data in the Columbia River basin and the Pacific Northwest. The project provides a variety of data related to fish resources and maintains a whole-stream routed hydrography layer for the Pacific Northwest. Information from the project is available through on-line database query, interactive maps, direct data download or by custom request. StreamNet receives funding from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA Project No.: 198810804) and is authorized under the Fish and Wildlife Program of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council. Other organizations provide funding for select project components. Participating agencies contribute significant in-kind services and include: the Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), Idaho Dept. of Fish and Game (IDFG), Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fisheries Commission (CRITFC). The StreamNet project is managed by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission in Portland, Oregon.</supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <sngdate>           <caldate>20100201</caldate>         </sngdate>       </timeinfo>       <current>publication date</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>In work</progress>       <update>As needed</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-126.093754</westbc>         <eastbc>-102.408965</eastbc>         <northbc>52.130782</northbc>         <southbc>31.933261</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>ESRI Geography Network Thesaurus</themekt>         <themekey>inlandWaters, hydrography, environment</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>StreamNet</placekt>         <placekey>Pacific Northwest, west coast, Columbia River Basin, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, California</placekey>       </place>       <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt>         <themekey>environment</themekey>         <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>       </theme>     </keywords>     <accconst>Public, Tribal Enterprises, Tribal Government, Individual Authorized Users</accconst>     <useconst>None</useconst>     <ptcontac>       <cntinfo>         <cntorgp>           <cntorg>StreamNet Project, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission</cntorg>           <cntper>Van C.

Edgematched and merged routes where necessary and rebuilt routes using the ArcGIS 'Create Routes' Linear Referencing Tool (which requires from-measure and to-measure fields). Note that areas of overlap exist between the PNWRF3 and CalHydro source datasets. Source features were selected based on the direction of flow within a HUC4. Streams flowing south into California were pulled from the CalHydro dataset where possible and those flowing north into Oregon were sourced from the PNWRF3. For the Klamath River, a source split was made at the outlet of Upper Klamath Lake. LLIDSRC and MEASSRC fields in the final product are useful for tracking the lineage of individual features. After this final data source was integrated, all routes were remeasured based on the newly refreshed BegFt and LengthFt fields. For the non-California sourced features, these measures are based on an integer version of the actual route lengths based on the MSHv1 projection (StreamNet Lambert, NAD83). For the CalHydro sourced features, BegFt and LengthFt values remain based on the values present in the original source dataset (which was determined using California's Teale Albers projection, NAD83). This was done purposefully to enable existing CalFISH event data to be mapped using the MSHv1 directly.</procdesc>         <srcused>CalHydro (CDFG_100k_2003_6.shp) &amp; ORIDMTWA</srcused>         <procdate>20080423</procdate>         <proctime>000000</proctime>         <srcprod>MSHv1_pre</srcprod>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntorgp>               <cntorg>StreamNet Project, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission</cntorg>               <cntper>Van C.

Linework from MSHv1 within the state of Oregon and some cross-border streams were replaced with new higher resolution linework sourced from ODFW's 'Oregon Mixed Scale Hydrography' layer. This source dataset is primarily a derivation of the Pacific Northwest Framework Hydrography dataset. It is a subset out of the Framework hydrography dataset designed to include all stream features present within the 1:100k scale PNW Hydrography dataset, all named 1:24k+ scale streams and all unnamed 1:24+ scale streams where aquatic resource information exists. Regional StreamNet staff took the following steps to incorporate this data into MSHv2: 1) Starting with the published MSHv1, linework within the state of Oregon was reviewed and cross-border streams shared with Washington, Idaho and California were evaluated to determine the best means of splicing the new linework into the existing route system. This review process involved discussions with StreamNet partners in OR, WA, and ID. 2) Rather than edge-matching linework from different data sources at version 2, we decided to leave the geometry disconnected in the cases where higher resolution (1:24k+) linework sourced from ODFW meets up with lower resolution (1:100k) linework from the original PNWRF3 dataset. This mainly occurs along the mainstem Columbia and Snake Rivers. This shortcoming in the dataset will be resolved in version 3 at which point mainstem rivers will likely be depicted using linework compatible with High Resolution NHD (HR-NHD). Users should note that this is a cartographic shortcoming that does not affect the functioning of the route system for linear referencing purposes. 3) Feature-level metadata fields were added to track the source of route feature geometry (GeomSrc), measures (MeasSrc), and LLID attributes (LLIDSrc). See the data dictionary for details. 4) Location cross referencing fields were added to allow quick spatial filtering of streams and speed creation of StreamNet's internal \"LocXTables\". 5) Resulting product went through further QA/QC with some corrections, mainly to feature attributes, names, etc. Metadata updated and first draft published for review by partner agencies.</procdesc>         <srcused>Hydrort_MSHv1</srcused>         <srcprod>Hydrort_MSHv2</srcprod>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Create MSHv1: Step 1 - Best available PNWRF3 datasets were collected and appended for Idaho, Oregon and western Montana. The latest working copies of the PNWRF3 were obtained from StreamNet partners to capture mostly minor corrections that have been made through time and include them in the MSHv1. Updates were received from IDFG (ArcInfo coverage, \"idfg_snhydro\") and MFWP (measured shapefile, \"strm_rts\"). Route features were appended for ID, MT and OR. Attributes for BegFt and LengthFt were retained to maintain flow direction and permit the rebuilding of routes using the ArcGIS 'Create Routes' Linear Referencing Tool (which requires from-measure and to-measure fields).</procdesc>         <srcused>PNWRF3</srcused>         <procdate>20080423</procdate>         <proctime>000000</proctime>         <srcprod>ORIDMT</srcprod>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntorgp>               <cntorg>StreamNet Project, Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission</cntorg>               <cntper>Van C.

It is important to not the method of using coordinates to derive the ID is only intended to ensure the uniqueness of the original ID assignment. It is not intended to be a 'smart code' and does NOT change if the location of the stream mouth differs through time.  See the LLIDSrc field to determine which agency assigned the LLID for a given stream.
