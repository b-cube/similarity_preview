This paper develops a simple model that can exhibit self-fulfilling&lt;br/&gt;fluctuations in the expected path for unemployment. The novel feature is that the scope for sunspot-driven&lt;br/&gt;volatility depends on the level of household wealth. When wealth is high, consumer demand&lt;br/&gt;is largely insensitive to unemployment expectations and the economy is robust to confidence crises.&lt;br/&gt;When wealth is low, a stronger precautionary motive makes demand more sensitive to unemployment&lt;br/&gt;expectations, and the economy becomes vulnerable to confidence-driven fluctuations. In this&lt;br/&gt;case, there is a potential role for public policies to stabilize demand. Microeconomic evidence is&lt;br/&gt;consistent with the key model mechanism: during the Great Recession, consumers with relatively&lt;br/&gt;low wealth, &lt;em&gt;ceteris paribus&lt;/em&gt;, cut expenditures more sharply.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{27415924-629E-4335-97B1-A01224EAE847}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/shadow-insurance</link><title>Shadow Insurance</title><description>Liabilities ceded by life insurers to shadow reinsurers (i.e., less regulated and unrated off-balance-sheet&lt;br/&gt;entities) grew from $11 billion in 2002 to $364 billion in 2012. Life insurers using shadow insurance,&lt;br/&gt;which capture half of the market share, ceded 25 cents of every dollar insured to shadow reinsurers in&lt;br/&gt;2012, up from 2 cents in 2002. Our adjustment for shadow insurance reduces risk-based capital by 53&lt;br/&gt;percentage points (or 3 rating notches) and increases default probabilities by a factor of 3.5. We develop a&lt;br/&gt;structural model of the life insurance industry and estimate the impact of current policy proposals to limit&lt;br/&gt;or eliminate shadow insurance. In the counterfactual without shadow insurance, the average company using&lt;br/&gt;shadow insurance would raise prices by 10 to 21 percent, and annual life insurance underwritten&lt;br/&gt;would fall by 7 to 16 percent for the industry.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{4DEB9112-4A6A-4F53-BCDC-625E75ACE7F8}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/quid-pro-quo-technology-capital-transfers-for-market-access-in-china</link><title>Quid Pro Quo: Technology Capital Transfers for Market Access in China</title><description>By the 1970s, &lt;em&gt;quid pro quo&lt;/em&gt; policy, which requires multinational firms to transfer technology in return for market access, had become a common practice in many developing countries. While many countries have subsequently liberalized quid pro quo requirements, China continues to follow the policy. In this paper, we incorporate quid pro quo policy into a multicountry dynamic general equilibrium model, using microevidence from Chinese patents to motivate key assumptions about the terms of the technology transfer deals and macroevidence on China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds inward foreign direct investment (FDI) to estimate key model parameters. We then use the model to quantify the impact of China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds quid pro quo policy and show that it has had a significant impact on global innovation and welfare.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELATED PAPERS:  Staff Report 487 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr487.pdf'&gt;Technical Appendix for Quid Pro Quo: Technology Capital Transfers for Market Access in China,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Staff Report 488 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr488.pdf'&gt; Patent Data Appendix for Quid Pro Quo: Technology Capital Transfers for Market Access in China,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Staff Report 396 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr396.pdf'&gt;Openness, Technology Capital, and Development,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and Staff Report 406 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr406.pdf'&gt;Technology Capital and the U.S. Current Account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{ACD5F282-DFB8-40A8-84F4-326AFF66E68B}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/health-and-mortality-delta-assessing-the-welfare-cost-of-household-insurance-choice</link><title>Health and Mortality Delta: Assessing the Welfare Cost of Household Insurance Choice</title><description>We develop a pair of risk measures, health and mortality delta, for the universe of life and health insurance products. A life-cycle model of insurance choice simplifies to replicating the optimal health and mortality delta through a portfolio of insurance products. We estimate the model to explain the observed variation in health and mortality delta implied by the ownership of life insurance, annuities including private pensions, and long-term care insurance in the Health and Retirement Study. For the median household aged 51 to 57, the lifetime welfare cost of market incompleteness and suboptimal choice is 3.2% of total wealth.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{B9EA4CF8-B1D4-4155-9636-6BF5F0453ED3}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/optimal-income-taxation-mirrlees-meets-ramsey</link><title>Optimal Income Taxation: Mirrlees Meets Ramsey</title><description>What structure of income taxation maximizes the social benefits of redistribution while minimizing the social harm associated with distorting the allocation of labor input? Many authors have advocated scrapping the current tax system, which redistributes primarily via marginal tax rates that rise with income, and replacing it with a flat tax system, in which marginal tax rates are constant and redistribution is achieved via non-means-tested transfers. In this paper we compare alternative tax systems in an environment with distinct roles for public and private insurance. We evaluate alternative policies using a social welfare function designed to capture the taste for redistribution reflected in the current tax system. In our preferred specification, moving to the optimal flat tax policy reduces welfare, whereas moving to the optimal fully nonlinear Mirrlees policy generates only tiny welfare gains. These findings suggest that proposals for dramatic tax reform should be viewed with caution.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{111FE64F-E969-43CC-8674-5EFD9E92CA8B}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/migration-congestion-externalities-and-the-evaluation-of-spatial-investments</link><title>Migration, Congestion Externalities, and the Evaluation of Spatial Investments</title><description>The direct benefits of infrastructure in developing countries can be large, but if new infrastructure induces in-migration, congestion of other local publicly provided goods may offset the direct benefits.  Using the example of rural household electrification in South Africa, we demonstrate the importance of accounting for migration when evaluating welfare gains of spatial programs. We also provide a practical approach to computing welfare gains that  does not rely on land prices. We develop a location choice model that incorporates missing land markets and allows for congestion in local land.  Using this model, we construct welfare bounds as a function of the income and population effects of the new electricity infrastructure.  A novel prediction from the model is that migration elasticities and congestion effects are especially large when land markets are missing. We empirically estimate these welfare bounds for rural electrification in South Africa and show that congestion externalities from program-induced migration reduced local welfare gains by about 40%.</description><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{67660093-667E-4DF2-8C23-BC2F736F7F6A}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/the-cost-of-financial-frictions-for-life-insurers</link><title>The Cost of Financial Frictions for Life Insurers</title><description>During the financial crisis, life insurers sold long-term policies at deep discounts relative to actuarial value. The average markup was as low as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd19 percent for annuities and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd57 percent for life insurance. This extraordinary pricing behavior was due to financial and product market frictions, interacting with statutory reserve regulation that allowed life insurers to record far less than a dollar of reserve per dollar of future insurance liability. We identify the shadow cost of capital through exogenous variation in required reserves across different types of policies. The shadow cost was $0.96 per dollar of statutory capital for the average company in November 2008.</description><pubDate>Fri, 14 Nov 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{0461BECC-77C9-40EF-9F28-CA019974DB28}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/optimal-regulation-in-the-presence-of-reputation-concerns</link><title>Optimal Regulation in the Presence of Reputation Concerns</title><description>In all markets, firms go through a process of creative destruction: entry, random growth and exit. In many of these markets there are also regulations that restrict entry, possibly distorting this process. We study the public interest rationale for entry taxes in a general equilibrium model with free entry and exit of firms in which firm dynamics are driven by reputation concerns. In our model firms can produce &lt;br&gt;high-quality output by making a costly but efficient initial unobservable investment. If buyers never learn about this investment, an extreme \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlemons problem\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd develops, no firm invests, and the market shuts down. Learning introduces reputation incentives such that a fraction of entrants do invest. We show that, if the market operates with spot prices, entry taxes always enhance the role of reputation to induce investment, improving welfare despite the impact of these taxes on equilibrium prices and total production.</description><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{9765D42F-11CB-4BDC-B7FA-457A728CF602}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/analyzing-the-labor-market-outcomes-of-occupational-licensing</link><title>Analyzing the Labor Market Outcomes of Occupational Licensing</title><description>Recent assessments of occupational licensing have shown varying effects of the institution on labor market outcomes. This study revisits the relationship between occupational licensing and labor market outcomes by analyzing a new topical module to the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Relative to previously available data, the topical module offers more detailed information on occupational licensing from government, with a larger sample size and access to a richer set of person-level characteristics. We exploit this larger and more detailed data set to examine the labor market outcomes of occupational licensing and how workers obtain these licenses from government. More specifically, we analyze whether there is evidence of a licensing wage premium, and how this premium varies with aspects of the regulatory regime such as the requirements to obtain a license or certification and the level of government oversight. After controlling for observable heterogeneity, including occupational status, we find that those with a license earn higher pay, are more likely to be employed, and have a higher probability of retirement and pension plan offers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{F9F40991-379D-4049-B0A9-F477330CA946}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/why-are-married-women-working-so-much</link><title>Why Are Married Women Working So Much?</title><description>We study the large observed changes in labor supply by married women in the United States over the post\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWorld War II period, a period that saw little change in the labor supply by single women. We investigate the effects of changes in the gender wage gap, the quantitative impact of technological improvements in the production of nonmarket goods, and the potential inferiority of nonmarket goods in explaining the dramatic change in labor supply. We find that small decreases in the gender wage gap can simultaneously explain the significant increases in the average hours worked by married women and the relative constancy in the hours worked by single women and by single and married men. We also find that the impact of technological improvements in the household on married female hours and on the relative wage of females to males is too small for realistic values. Some specifications of the inferiority of home goods match the hours patterns, but they have counterfactual predictions for wages and expenditure patterns.</description><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{45AC961D-2585-432D-98C1-1E08571E8BF3}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/on-financing-retirement-with-an-aging-population</link><title>On Financing Retirement with an Aging Population</title><description>A problem that faces many countries including the United States is how to finance retirement consumption as the population ages. Proposals for switching to a saving-for-retirement system that do not rely on high payroll taxes have been challenged on the grounds that welfare would fall for some groups such as retirees or the working poor. We show how to devise a transition path from the current U.S. system to a saving-for-retirement system that increases the welfare of all current and future generations, with estimates of future gains close to 70 percent higher than those found in typically used macroeconomic models. The gains are large because there is more productive capital than commonly assumed. Furthermore, the gains are amplified if we lower capital income taxes in addition to payroll taxes, because the value of business equity increases relative to the capital stock. Our quantitative results depend importantly on accounting for differences between actual government tax revenues and what revenues would be if all income were taxed at the income-weighted average marginal tax rates used in our analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELATED PAPER: Staff Report 473 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr473.pdf'&gt;Technical Appendix: On Financing Retirement with an Aging Population&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{F984354E-74EC-4BF5-8933-EB8996EF3599}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/technical-appendix-on-financing-retirement-with-an-aging-population</link><title>Technical Appendix: On Financing Retirement with an Aging Population</title><description>No abstract available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELATED PAPER: Staff Report 472 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr472.pdf'&gt;On Financing Retirement with an Aging Population&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{D187E601-256A-4E7E-89F7-48133651B110}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/banks-liquidity-management-and-monetary-policy</link><title>Banks, Liquidity Management, and Monetary Policy</title><description>We develop a new framework to study the implementation of monetary policy through the banking system. Banks finance illiquid loans by issuing deposits. Deposit transfers across banks must be settled using central bank reserves. Transfers are random and therefore create liquidity risk, which in turn determines the supply of credit and the money multiplier. We study how different shocks to the banking system and monetary policy affect the economy by altering the trade-off between profiting from lending and incurring greater liquidity risk. We calibrate our model to study quantitatively why banks have recently increased their reserve holdings but have not expanded lending despite policy efforts. Our analysis underscores an important role of disruptions in interbank markets, followed by a persistent credit demand shock.</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{2179FEE6-6A98-40E4-A35A-071AC2E33A8B}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/technical-appendix-for-quid-pro-quo-technology-capital-transfers-for-market-access-in-china</link><title>Technical Appendix for Quid Pro Quo: Technology Capital Transfers for Market Access in China</title><description>No abstract available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELATED PAPERS:  Staff Report 486 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr486.pdf'&gt;Quid Pro Quo: Technology Capital Transfers for Market Access in China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and Staff Report 488 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr488.pdf'&gt; Patent Data Appendix for Quid Pro Quo: Technology Capital Transfers for Market Access in China,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{8A7BD3F6-EE2D-4BA5-B532-6D2154E4C61F}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/term-structures-of-inflation-expectations-and-real-interest-rates-the-effects-of-unconventional-monetary-policy</link><title>Term Structures of Inflation Expectations and Real Interest Rates: The Effects of  Unconventional Monetary Policy</title><description>Inflation expectations have recently received increased interest because of the uncertainty created by the Federal Reserve\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds unprecedented reaction to the Great Recession.

The paper examines the circumstances under which a &lt;i&gt;death spiral&lt;/i&gt; arises, where cutbacks of city services and increases in taxes lead to an exodus of residents, compounding financial distress.

Countries are linked to one another by borrowing from and renegotiating with common lenders. Countries default together because by doing so they can renegotiate the debt simultaneously and pay lower recoveries. Defaulting is also attractive in response to foreign defaults because the cost of rolling over the debt is higher when other countries default. Such forces are quantitatively important for generating a positive correlation of spreads and joint incidence of default. The model can rationalize some of the recent economic events in Europe as well as the historical patterns of defaults, renegotiations, and recoveries across countries</description><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{671F258F-8CA9-4C34-87B2-7CC089E666E7}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/intergenerational-redistribution-in-the-great-recession</link><title>Intergenerational Redistribution in the Great Recession</title><description>We construct a stochastic overlapping-generations general equilibrium model in which households are subject to aggregate shocks that affect both wages and asset prices. We use a calibrated version of the model to quantify how the welfare costs of big recessions are distributed across different household age groups. The model predicts that younger cohorts fare better than older cohorts when the equilibrium decline in asset prices is large relative to the decline in wages. Asset price declines hurt the old, who rely on asset sales to finance consumption, but benefit the young, who purchase assets at depressed prices. In our preferred calibration, asset prices decline 2.4 times as much as wages, consistent with the experience of the US economy in the Great Recession. A model recession is close to welfare neutral for households in the 20\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd29 age group, but translates into a large welfare loss of more than 8% of lifetime consumption for households aged 70 and over.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{3BE9ABE6-9C35-4716-BD99-AF58E98C0406}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/demographics-in-dynamic-heckscherohlin-modelsoverlapping-generations-versus-infinitely-lived-consumers</link><title>Demographics in Dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin Models: Overlapping Generations versus Infinitely Lived Consumers</title><description>We contrast the properties of dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models with overlapping generations with those of models with infinitely lived consumers under both closed and open international capital markets.  In both environments, if capital is mobile, factor price equalization occurs after the initial period.  If capital is not mobile, the properties of equilibria differ drastically across environments:  With infinitely lived consumers, factor prices equalize in any steady state or cycle and, in general, there is positive trade in any steady state or cycle.  With overlapping generations, we construct examples with steady states and cycles in which factor prices are not equalized, and any equilibrium that converges to a steady state or a cycle with factor price equalization has no trade after a finite number of periods.</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2014 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{F3673CD2-2273-4F69-8CE5-7D7E86BD4AD8}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/a-reassessment-of-real-business-cycle-theory</link><title>A Reassessment of Real Business Cycle Theory</title><description>During the downturn of 2008\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2009, output and hours fell significantly while labor productivity rose.

Measured labor productivity rises if the fall in output is underestimated; this occurs when there are large unmeasured intangible investments.

Our analysis suggests that debt levels are so high that bailouts with penalty interest rates could induce the Eurozone governments to default rather than reduce their debt.

On the one hand, a progressive tax system can counteract inequality in initial conditions and substitute for imperfect private insurance against idiosyncratic earnings risk. At the same time, progressivity reduces incentives to work and to invest in skills, and aggravates the externality associated with valued public expenditures. We develop a tractable equilibrium model that features all of these trade-offs. The analytical expressions we derive for social welfare deliver a transparent understanding of how preferences, technology, and market structure parameters influence the optimal degree of progressivity. A calibration for the U.S. economy indicates that endogenous skill investment, flexible labor supply, and the externality linked to valued government purchases play quantitatively similar roles in limiting desired progressivity.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{D02F678A-9B24-4D0A-8986-6C3D051A2B2C}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/using-the-new-products-margin-to-predict-the-industrylevel-impact-of-trade-reform</link><title>Using the New Products Margin to Predict the Industry-Level Impact of Trade Reform</title><description>This paper develops a methodology for predicting the impact of trade liberalization on exports by industry (3-digit ISIC) based on the pre-liberalization distribution of exports by product (5-digit SITC). Using the results of Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) that much of the growth in trade after trade liberalization is in products that are traded very little or not at all, we predict that industries with a higher share of exports generated by least traded products will experience more growth. Using our methodology, we develop predictions for industry-level changes in trade for the United States and Korea following the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). As a test for our methodology, we show that it performs significantly better than the applied general equilibrium models originally used for the policy evaluation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).</description><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{AEC9E648-C734-4957-B951-7F142C6F1868}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/renegotiation-policies-in-sovereign-defaults</link><title>Renegotiation Policies in Sovereign Defaults</title><description>This paper studies an optimal renegotiation protocol designed by a benevolent planner when two countries renegotiate with the same lender. The solution calls for recoveries that induce each country to default or repay, trading off the deadweight costs and the redistribution benefits of default independently of the other country. This outcome contrasts with a decentralized bargaining solution where default in one country increases the likelihood of default in the second country because recoveries are lower when both countries renegotiate.

In the data, when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens and the spread on short-term bonds rises more than the spread on long-term bonds. To account for this pattern, we build a dynamic model of international borrowing with endogenous default and multiple maturities of debt. Long-term debt provides a hedge against future fluctuations in interest rate spreads, while short-term debt is more effective at providing incentives to repay. The trade-off between these hedging and incentive benefits is quantitatively important for understanding the maturity structure in emerging markets. When calibrated to data from Brazil, the model accounts for the dynamics in the maturity of debt issuances and its comovement with the level of spreads across maturities.</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{E422F3C7-0D58-4D15-A232-D0A135D303C4}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/learningbyemploying-the-value-of-commitment-under-uncertainty</link><title>Learning-by-Employing: The Value of Commitment under Uncertainty</title><description>We analyze commitment to employment in an environment in which an infinitely lived firm faces a sequence of finitely lived workers who differ in their ability to produce output.

The model features three mild departures from the standard model: (1) adjustment costs make it difficult to expand the tradable goods sector by reallocating factors of production from nontradables to tradables; (2) there is a mild form of labor market frictions (Nash bargaining wage setting with Mortensen-Pissarides labor markets); (3) goods markets for nontradables require active search from households wherein increases in consumption expenditures increase measured productivity. These departures provide a novel quantitative theory to explain recessions like those in southern Europe without relying on technology shocks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{32B92C39-BD56-43EA-9304-51F7116C0B04}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/global-imbalances-and-structural-change-in-the-united-states</link><title>Global Imbalances and Structural Change in the United States</title><description>Since the early 1990s, as the United States has borrowed from the rest of the world, employment in U.S. goods-producing sectors has fallen.

We accomplish this task by using indirect inference to estimate a structural consumption-savings model, in which individuals both learn about the nature of their income process and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with which individuals know their own income growth rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data. In implementing indirect inference, we find that an auxiliary model that approximates the true structural equations of the model (which are not estimable) works very well, with negligible small sample bias. The main substantive findings are that income shocks are not very persistent, systematic differences in income growth rates are large, individuals have substantial amounts of information about their income growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are effectively smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these findings together, we argue that the amount of uninsurable lifetime income risk that individuals perceive is substantially smaller than what is typically assumed in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete markets.</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{29B37F33-7C3E-4ACB-A7F2-F937A3223483}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/measuring-the-financial-soundness-of-us-firms-19262012</link><title>Measuring the Financial Soundness of U.S. Firms, 1926\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2012</title><description>Building on the Merton (1974) and Leland (1994) structural models of credit risk, we develop a simple, transparent, and robust method for measuring the financial soundness of individual firms using data on their equity volatility.

There is substantial, statistically significant heterogeneity in estimated risk preferences. Full insurance cannot be rejected. As the risk sharing, as-if-complete-markets theory might predict, estimated risk preferences are unrelated to wealth or other characteristics. The heterogeneity matters for policy: Although the average household would benefit from eliminating village-level risk, less-risk-averse households who are paid to absorb that risk would be worse off by several percent of household consumption.</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{EBD83EEA-68A5-441E-B78A-D713CDBDEC45}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/job-matching-within-and-across-firms</link><title>Job Matching Within and Across Firms</title><description>In order to analyze careers both within and across firms, this paper proposes a matching model of the labor market that extends existing models of job assignment and learning about workers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd abilities. The model accounts for worker mobility across jobs and firms, for varying degrees of generality of ability, and for the possibility that firms affect the information they acquire about workers through job assignment. I characterize equilibrium assignment and wages, and show how, depending on how abilities and jobs are distributed across firms, equilibrium gives rise to widely varying patterns of job mobility within firms and turnover across firms, even if matching would be perfectly assortative in the absence of uncertainty. The implied job and wage dynamics display features that are consistent with a broad set of empirical findings on careers in firms and the labor market. In particular, workers can experience gradual promotions and wage increases following successful performance but few or no demotions when employed by the same firm. The model also produces turnover across firms and occupations after both successful and unsuccessful experiences, leading to wage increases or decreases following a firm or occupation change. Overall, the results in this paper provide a unified framework in which to interpret the dynamics of jobs and wages in firms and the labor market.</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{CAB95616-8756-41A4-B0EA-0D6FBED34D74}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/careers-in-firms-estimating-a-model-of-job-assignment-learning-and-human-capital-acquisition</link><title>Careers in Firms: Estimating a Model of Job Assignment, Learning, and Human Capital Acquisition</title><description>This paper develops and structurally estimates a labor market model that integrates job assignment, learning, and human capital acquisition to account for the main patterns of careers in firms. A key innovation is that the model incorporates workers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd job mobility within and between firms, and the possibility that, through job assignment, firms affect the rate at which they acquire information about workers. The model is estimated using longitudinal administrative data on managers from one U.S. firm in a service industry (the data of Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstr\\ufffd\\ufffdm (1994a,b)) and fits the data remarkably well. The estimated model is used to assess both the direct effect of learning on wages and its indirect effect through its impact on the dynamics of job assignment. Consistent with the evidence in the literature on comparative advantage and learning, the estimated direct effect of learning on wages is found to be small. Unlike in previous work, by jointly estimating the dynamics of beliefs, jobs, and wages imposing all of the model restrictions, the impact of learning on job assignment can be uncovered and the indirect effect of learning on wages explicitly assessed. The key finding of the paper is that the indirect effect of learning on wages is substantial: overall learning accounts for one quarter of the cumulative wage growth on the job during the first seven years of tenure. Nearly all of the remaining growth is from human capital acquisition. A related novel finding is that the experimentation component of learning is a primary determinant of the timing of promotions and wage increases. Along with persistent uncertainty about ability, experimentation is responsible for substantially compressing wage growth at low tenures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;RELATED PAPER: Staff Report 470 &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href='http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr470.pdf'&gt;Supplementary Appendix: Careers in Firms\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEstimating a Model of Job Assignment, Learning, and Human Capital Acquisition &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{0E744A57-A826-4E22-8AF1-BAB21A1ECCAC}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/supplementary-appendix-careers-in-firmsestimating-a-model-of-job-assignment-learning-and-human-capital-acquisition</link><title>Supplementary Appendix: Careers in Firms\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEstimating a Model of Job Assignment, Learning, and Human Capital Acquisition</title><description>In this appendix I present details of the model and the empirical analysis, and results of counterfactual experiments omitted from the paper. In Section 1 I describe a simple example that illustrates how, even in the absence of human capital acquisition, productivity shocks, or separation shocks, the learning component of the model can naturally generate mobility between jobs within a firm and turnover between firms. I also include the proofs of Propositions 1 and 2 in the paper. In Section 2 I discuss model identification in detail, where, in particular, I prove that information in my data on the performance ratings of managers allows me to identify the learning process separately from the human capital process. In Section 3 I describe the original U.S. firm dataset of Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstr\\ufffd\\ufffdm (1994a,b), on which my work is based. In Section 4 I provide details about the estimation of the model, including the derivation of the likelihood function, a description of the numerical solution of the model, and a discussion of the results from a Monte Carlo exercise showing the identifiability of the model\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds parameters in practice. There I also derive bounds on the informativeness of the jobs of the competitors of the firm in my data, based on the estimates of the parameters reported in the paper. Finally, in Section 5 I present estimation results based on a larger sample that includes entrants into the firm at levels higher than Level 1.

If benevolent governments can commit to their policies, it is optimal not to interfere with private contracts. Such policies are time inconsistent in the sense that, without commitment, governments have incentives to bail out firms by buying up the debt of distressed firms and renegotiating their contracts with managers. From an ex ante perspective, however, such bailouts are costly because they worsen incentives and thereby reduce welfare. We show that regulation in the form of limits on the debt-to-value ratio of firms mitigates the time-inconsistency problem by eliminating the incentives of governments to undertake bailouts. In terms of the cyclical properties of regulation, we show that regulation should be tightest in ag-gregate states in which resources lost to bankruptcy in the equilibrium without a government are largest.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{C0CECE97-47C2-4585-9024-C045C3479F4D}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/assessing-international-efficiency</link><title>Assessing International Efficiency</title><description>This chapter is structured in three parts. The first part outlines the methodological steps, involving both theoretical and empirical work, for assessing whether an observed allocation of resources across countries is efficient. The second part applies the methodology to the long-run allocation of capital and consumption in a large cross section of countries. We find that countries that grow faster in the long run also tend to save more both domestically and internationally. These facts suggest that either the long-run allocation of resources across countries is inefficient, or that there is a systematic relation between fast growth and preference for delayed consumption. The third part applies the methodology to the allocation of resources across developed countries at the business cycle frequency. Here we discuss how evidence on international quantity comovement, exchange rates, asset prices, and international portfolio holdings can be used to assess efficiency. Overall, quantities and portfolios appear consistent with efficiency, while evidence from prices is difficult to interpret using standard models. The welfare costs associated with an inefficient allocation of resources over the business cycle can be significant if shocks to relative country permanent income are large. In those cases partial financial liberalization can lower welfare.</description><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2013 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{BA664377-AF38-47A3-B683-1A98CC83EB31}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/how-important-is-the-new-goods-margin-in-international-trade</link><title>How Important Is the New Goods Margin in International Trade?</title><description>We propose a methodology for studying changes in bilateral commodity trade due to goods not exported previously or exported only in small quantities.

We pose a new ingredient that greatly magnifies the recession: a reduction in consumption expenditures reduces measured productivity, while technology is unchanged due to reduced utilization of production capacity.

Given this new status, the Puerto Rican sugar industry grew dramatically, soon far outstripping Louisiana\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds production. Then, in the middle 1960s, something amazing happened. Production collapsed. Manufacturing sugar in Puerto Rico was no longer profitable. Louisiana, in contrast, continued to produce and grow sugar. We argue that local economic policy was responsible for the industry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds demise. In the 1930s and 1940s, the local Puerto Rican government enacted policies to stifle the growth of large cane-farms. As a result, starting in the late 1930s, farm size fell, mechanization of farms essentially ceased, and the Puerto Rican sugar industry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds productivity (relative to Louisiana) rapidly declined until the industry collapsed. The overall Puerto Rican economy also began to perform poorly in the late 1930s. In particular, Puerto Rico\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds per capita income was converging to that of the poorest U.S. states until the late 1930s, but since then it has lost ground to these states. One naturally wonders: was the poor overall performance of the Puerto Rican economy also the result of policy? We show that Puerto Rico embarked on other economic policies in the early 1940s that proved to be major setbacks to its economic development.</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Dec 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{1A687B5A-FB3C-4338-8677-FC885BD415D0}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/the-nature-of-countercyclical-income-risk</link><title>The Nature of Countercyclical Income Risk</title><description>This paper studies the nature of business cycle variation in individual earnings risk using a confidential dataset from the U.S. Social Security Administration, which contains (uncapped) earnings histories for millions of individuals. The base sample is a nationally representative panel containing 10 percent of all U.S. males from 1978 to 2010. We use these data to decompose individual earnings growth during recessions into \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbetween-group\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwithin-group\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd components. We begin with the behavior of within-group shocks. Contrary to past research, we do not find the variance of idiosyncratic earnings shocks to be countercyclical. Instead, it is the left-skewness of shocks that is strongly countercyclical. That is, during recessions, the upper end of the shock distribution collapses\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlarge upward earnings movements become less likely\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwhereas the bottom end expands\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlarge drops in earnings become more likely. Thus, while the dispersion of shocks does not increase, shocks become more left-skewed and, hence, risky during recessions. Second, to study between-group differences, we group individuals based on several observable characteristics at the time a recession hits. One of these characteristics\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe average earnings of an individual at the beginning of a business cycle episode\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdproves to be an especially good predictor of fortunes during a recession: prime-age workers that enter a recession with high average earnings suffer substantially less compared with those who enter with low average earnings (which is not the case during expansions). Finally, we find that the cyclical nature of earnings risk is dramatically different for the top 1 percent compared with all other individuals\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeven relative to those in the top 2 to 5 percent.</description><pubDate>Mon, 03 Dec 2012 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{6CA44E17-7D1E-486A-AD7F-E8EA50160D93}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/do-newspapers-matter-shortrun-and-longrun-evidence-from-the-closure-of-the-cincinnati-post</link><title>Do Newspapers Matter?

We uncover an enormous amount of heterogeneity in expected longevities between individuals in different socioeconomic groups, albeit less than implied by a naive (static) use of socioeconomic characteristics. Our analysis allows us to decompose the longevity differentials into differences in health at age 50, differences in mortality conditional on health, and differences in the evolution of health with age. Remarkably, it is the latter that is the most important for most socioeconomic characteristics. For instance, education and wealth are health protecting but have little impact on two-year mortality rates conditional on health. Finally, we document an increasing time trend of all these differentials in the period 1992\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2008, and a likely increase in the socioeconomic gradient in mortality rates in the near future. The mortality differences that we find have huge welfare implications that dwarf the differences in consumption accruing to people in different socioeconomic groups.</description><pubDate>Tue, 28 Aug 2012 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{1730B200-D597-4035-AC21-3A3A69458636}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/new-and-larger-costs-of-monopoly-and-tariffs</link><title>New and Larger Costs of Monopoly and Tariffs</title><description>Fifty-eight years ago, Harberger (1954) estimated that the costs of monopoly, which resulted from misallocation of resources &lt;i&gt;across&lt;/i&gt; industries, were trivial. Others showed the same was true for tariffs. This research soon led to the consensus that monopoly costs are of little significance\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda consensus that persists to this day.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This paper reports on a new literature that takes a different approach to the costs of monopoly. It examines the costs of monopoly and tariffs &lt;i&gt;within&lt;/i&gt; industries. In particular, it examines the histories of industries in which a monopoly is destroyed (or tariffs greatly reduced) and the industry transitions quickly from monopoly to competition. If there are costs to monopoly and high tariffs within industries, we should be able to see these costs whittled away as the monopoly is destroyed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In contrast to the prevailing consensus, this new research has identified significant costs of monopoly. Monopoly (and high tariffs) is shown to significantly lower productivity within establishments. It also leads to misallocation within industry: resources are transferred from high to low productivity establishments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From these histories a common theme (or theory) emerges as to why monopoly is costly. When a monopoly is created, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrents\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are created. Conflict emerges among shareholders, managers, and employees of the monopoly as they negotiate how to divide these rents. Mechanisms are set up to split the rents. These mechanisms are often means to reduce competition &lt;i&gt;among&lt;/i&gt; members of the monopoly. Although the mechanisms divide rents, they also destroy them (by leading to low productivity and misallocation).</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{90FB6900-D8DA-4859-9E25-CBBA25B0C87E}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/money-is-an-experience-good-competition-and-trust-in-the-private-provision-of-money</link><title>Money Is an Experience Good: Competition and Trust in the Private Provision of Money</title><description>The interplay between competition and trust as efficiency-enhancing mechanisms in the private provision of money is studied. With commitment, trust is automatically achieved and competition ensures efficiency. Without commitment, competition plays no role. Trust does play a role but requires a bound on efficiency. Stationary inflation must be non-negative and, therefore, the Friedman rule cannot be achieved. The quality of money can be observed only after its purchasing capacity is realized. In this sense, money is an experience good.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{DA483A42-AA20-45A7-8984-C3ABCCEA3429}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/gambling-for-redemption-and-selffulfilling-debt-crises</link><title>Gambling for Redemption and Self-Fulfilling Debt Crises</title><description>We develop a model for analyzing the sovereign debt crises of 2010\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2012 in the Eurozone. The government sets its expenditure-debt policy optimally. The need to sell large quantities of bonds every period leaves the government vulnerable to self-fulfilling crises in which investors, anticipating a crisis, are unwilling to buy the bonds, thereby provoking the crisis. In this situation, the optimal policy of the government is to reduce its debt to a level where crises are not possible. If, however, the economy is in a recession where there is a positive probability of recovery in fiscal revenues, the government may optimally choose to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgamble for redemption,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd running deficits and increasing its debt, thereby increasing its vulnerability to crises.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{D7BF8F8A-9D36-4371-B6E8-10B69291C34F}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/staff-reports/prices-are-sticky-after-all</link><title>Prices Are Sticky After All</title><description>Recent studies say prices change about every four months. Economists have interpreted this high frequency as evidence against the importance of sticky prices for the real effects of monetary policy. Theory implies that this interpretation is correct if most price changes are regular, but not if most are temporary, as in the data. Temporary changes have a striking feature: after such a change, the nominal price tends to return exactly to its preexisting level. We study versions of Calvo and menu cost models that replicate this feature. Both models predict that the degree of aggregate price stickiness is determined mostly by the frequency of regular price changes, not by the combined frequency of temporary and regular price changes. Since regular prices are sticky in the data, the models predict a substantial degree of aggregate price stickiness even though micro prices change frequently. In particular, the aggregate price level in our models is as sticky as in standard models in which micro prices change about once a year. In this sense, prices are sticky after all.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jul 2012 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item></channel></rss>",
