Stationary underwater video camera arrays, chevron traps, longlines and kali poles were deployed in 2006, and hook-and-line surveys were added in 2007. Results from these two cruises were used to compare and calibrate catch rates from multiple sampling methods to identify the most effective gear types in targeting reef fish assemblages, and to investigate the importance of habitat on catch rates of reef fishes. During the fall 2006 research cruise, a total of 110 stationary video camera array deployments, 113 chevron trap deployments, 171 kali pole deployments, and 92 longline deployments were done. A total of 3,158 individuals from 42 taxa were identified on the video reads; catches were dominated numerically by Decapterus spp., Caranx crysos, Diplectrum formosum, and Haemulon aurolineatum. Chevron traps caught a total of 459 fish/macro-invertebrates from 20 taxa, with Rhomboplites aurorubens, Diplectrum formosum, Calamus proridens, and Haemulon aurolineatum being the most abundant. A total of 359 fishes from 26 different fish taxa were collected in longline sets; catch was dominated by Epinephelus morio, which comprised 40.1% of the total catch. A total of 62 fish from 14 different taxa were collected in kali pole sets, with Epinephelus morio comprising 29% of the total catch. During the summer 2007 research cruise, a total of 51 stationary video camera array deployments, 164 chevron trap deployments, 332 kali pole deployments, 84 longline deployments, and 51 hook-and-line surveys were completed. A total of 1,635 individuals were identified from 67 taxa in the 51 video deployments observed; catches were dominated by Decapterus spp., Stegastes spp., and mixed pomacentrids, which represented almost 62% of the total individuals observed. Many commercially and recreationally important taxa were also observed. A total of 630 individuals were caught in chevron traps, including 24 fishes and two crab species; catches were dominated numerically by Rhomboplites aurorubens. Twenty-three different fish taxa were collected in longline sets, with Epinephelus morio comprising 62.7% of the total catch. A total of 161 fish from 15 different taxa were collected in kali pole sets, with Epinephelus morio comprising 71.4% of the total catch. During hook-and-line surveys, a total of 317 individuals were obtained, from 24 distinct taxa. Catch was dominated by Epinephelus morio, which comprised 43.2% of the total catch and occurred at 72.6% of all survey locations. Based on these comparisons, it appears that a combination of stationary video camera arrays, chevron traps, and at least one hooked gear would likely be the most efficient and cost-effective approach to monitoring reef fish resources along the west Florida shelf.   </abstract>       <purpose>To calibrate future data collected during a large-scale, multi-gear survey and to test the efficiency of the three gears in different habitats and depth regions</purpose>       <notes/>       <supplemental-info/>       <is-display-xml-formats>Y</is-display-xml-formats>       <data-status>Complete</data-status>       <fgdc-data-status>Complete</fgdc-data-status>       <org-id>1081</org-id>       <owner-org-name>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</owner-org-name>       <owner-org-acro>SEFSC</owner-org-acro>       <catalog-control-state>9</catalog-control-state>       <parent-cat-id>9408</parent-cat-id>       <parent-cat-type-code>PRJ</parent-cat-type-code>       <parent-title>A pilot project for testing the efficacy of multiple gear sampling for monitoring abundance of reef fishes in the eastern Gulf of Mexico</parent-title>       <created-by>Lee Weinberger</created-by>       <created-by-pers-id>1279</created-by-pers-id>       <record-created>2013-07-02T11:23:39</record-created>       <record-last-modified>2014-11-24T07:22:35</record-last-modified>       <record-published>2014-11-24</record-published>       <publication-status>Public</publication-status>       <metadata-last-modification-date>2014-11-24</metadata-last-modification-date>       <data-set-publication-status>Unpublished</data-set-publication-status>       <metadata-next-review-date>2015-11-25</metadata-next-review-date>       <linking-share-level>Public</linking-share-level>    </common-information>    <physical-location>       <organization>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</organization>       <city>Miami</city>       <state-province>FL</state-province>       <country>USA</country>    </physical-location>    <data-set type=\"Mixed\">       <maintenance-frequency>None planned</maintenance-frequency>       <data-set-publication-status>Unpublished</data-set-publication-status>    </data-set>    <keywords>       <theme-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">Reef Fish, snapper, grouper, distribution, abundance, cooperative research, water quality, 06crp010, na06nmf4540058, behzad mahmoudi, cameron guenther, gear sampling, fisheries independent data</keyword-list>       </theme-keywords>       <spatial-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">Eastern Gulf Of Mexico, Florida, west florida shelf, tampa bay</keyword-list>       </spatial-keywords>       <stratum-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">species, size, depth, habitat type</keyword-list>       </stratum-keywords>       <temporal-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">2006, 2007</keyword-list>       </temporal-keywords>    </keywords>    <data-attributes/>    <support-roles>       <support-role ccid=\"165169\"                     type=\"\"                     last-modified=\"\"                     created=\"\"                     org=\"1081\"                     person=\"2818\"                     support-role=\"2680\">          <role>Distributor</role>          <role-definition>&lt;F6.1&gt;
