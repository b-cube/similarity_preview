This includes maintaining a statewide database, the Response and Surveillance System for Childhood Lead Exposures (RASSCLE II) with blood lead levels and other demographic information about children who have been screened (blood lead tested).  &#13; &#13; In instances where laboratory results had a detection threshold of 5.0 micrograms per deciliter (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL) and blood measurements were reported at below this level, the result was counted as &lt;4.5 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL. Duplicate children, duplicate blood tests, identified false positive tests, and tests known to be clerical errors have been excluded.&#13; &#13; CEHTP obtained blood lead level data from CLPP and created this dataset to be used for public health surveillance.  The dataset on the CEHTP portal includes counts and percentages of blood lead levels of children tested by county and age (0-5, 6-21, and 0-21). Children are unique per year, only their highest blood lead level is reported. Percentages were calculated by CLPP by using the total number of children tested in the denominator.&#13;  &#13; </procdesc> <procdate>20100403</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Housing information about the U.S. population are collected by the U.S. government via the U.S. census every 10 years.
