Community networks get formed when individuals and local organisations from a geographic area team up to create and run a community-owned IP network to satisfy the community&amp;#39;s demand for ICT, such as facilitating Internet access and providing services of local interest. The consolidation of today&amp;#39;s cloud technologies offers now the possibility of collectively built community clouds, building upon user-generated content and user-provided networks towards an ecosystem of cloud services. To address the limitation and enhance utility of community networks, we propose a collaborative distributed architecture for building a community cloud system that employs resources contributed by the members of the community network for provisioning infrastructure and software services. Such architecture needs to be tailored to the specific social, economic and technical characteristics of the community networks for community clouds to be successful and sustainable. By real deployments of clouds in community networks and evaluation of application performance, we show that community clouds are feasible. Our result may encourage collaborative innovative cloud-based services made possible with the resources of a community.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:publisher/><dc:date>2014-09-10</dc:date><dc:source>http://zenodo.org/record/12596</dc:source><dc:doi>10.5281/zenodo.12596</dc:doi><dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12596</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12596</dc:identifier></dc:dc>   </collection>",
