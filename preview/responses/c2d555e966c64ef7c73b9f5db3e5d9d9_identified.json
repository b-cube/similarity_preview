Due to their ability to be processed at low temperature, over large areas, at low cost, organic semiconductors are experiencing an accelerated development that will lead to a new generation of products with thin and flexible form factors. While the organic semiconductor layer plays a central role, the interfaces that are formed between the organic semiconducting layer and adjacent oxide layers or electrodes are very critical and often determine the overall electrical performance of the device.&#13; &#13; In this talk, we will discuss the performance of a range of solid-state devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), sensors, and organic solar cells. We will present strategies to modify and stabilize the electronic properties of interfaces that can yield devices with improved performance and longer lifetime. We will show that these advances are likely to accelerate the deployment of flexible printed electronic technologies Bernard Kippelen is the Joseph M. Pettit Professor at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  His research interests range from the investigation of fundamental physical processes (nonlinear optical activity, charge transport, light harvesting and emission) in organic-based nanostructured thin films, to the design, fabrication and testing of light-weight flexible optoelectronic devices based on hybrid printable materials.; Presented on October 16, 2014 at 12:00 p.m. in the Marcus Nanotechnology Building Conference Room 1116.; Runtime:  59:36 minutes </summary> <dc:date>2014-10-16T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Kippelen, Bernard</dc:creator> <dc:description>Printed organic electronics, a technology based on organic semiconductors that can be processed into thin films using conventional printing and coating techniques, has been the subject of active research and development over the past decades.
