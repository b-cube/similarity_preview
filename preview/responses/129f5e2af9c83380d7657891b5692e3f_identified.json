These include Emperor, King and Adelie pengiuns, Light-mantled Sooty, Grey-headed and Black-browed albatrosses, Antarctic and Australian fur seals, Southern Elephant Seal and Blue and Humpback whales. Note that not all data for any species or locations is or will be exposed to OBIS. Geographic coverage is from Heard Island to the west and Macquarie Island to the east and several islands near the southern end of Chile. The data has been filtered to remove most but not all erroneous positions.  DiGIR is an engine which takes XML requests for data and returns a data subset stored as XML data (as defined in a schema). For more DiGIR information, see http://digir.sourceforge.net/ , http://diveintodigir.ecoforge.net/draft/digirdive.html , and http://digir.net/prov/prov_manual.html . A list of Digir providers is at http://bigdig.ecoforge.net/wiki/SchemaStatus .  Darwin is the original schema for use with the DiGIR engine.  The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) schema extends Darwin. For more OBIS info, see http://www.iobis.org . See the OBIS schema at http://www.iobis.org/tech/provider/questions .  Queries: Although OBIS datasets have many variables, most variables have few values.  The only queries that are likely to succeed MUST include a constraint for Genus= and MAY include constraints for Species=, longitude, latitude, and time.  Most OBIS datasets return a maximum of 1000 rows of data per request. The limitation is imposed by the OBIS administrators.

By using OBIS data, I agree that, in any publication or presentation of any sort based wholly or in part on such data, I will:  1. Acknowledge the use of specific records from contributing databases in the form appearing in the GLOBAL &#39;citation&#39; attribute thereof (if any); and acknowledge the use of the OBIS facility in one of the following prescribed forms:  For OBIS website:  Ocean Biogeographic Information System.

For information purposes, provide to kim.finney@aad.gov.au the full citation of any publication I make (printed or electronic) that cites OBIS or any constituent part.  3. Recognize the limitations of data in OBIS: OBIS is comparable to a scientific journal that makes data freely available on the internet. Thus the geographic and taxonomic scope, and quantity of data provided, depend on the scientists and organizations that provide data. However, in contrast to data in a journal, the &#39;reader&#39; can select and combine data in OBIS from a variety of sources. OBIS and its users give feedback on data quality and possible errors to data providers. Because data providers are willing to correct errors, the quality of the data will increase in time. How OBIS provides quality assurance, who is primarily responsible for data published in OBIS (its owners), issues to be considered in using the data, and known gaps in the data, are described below.  Quality assurance  Only data from authoritative scientists and science organizations approved by OBIS are served. All data are subject to quality control procedures before publication, and at regular intervals, with data providers informed of any discrepancies and potential errors (e.g. species names spelt incorrectly, mapping errors). OBIS also benefits from user peer-review and feedback to identify technical, geographic, and taxonomic errors in data served. However, although errors will exist as they do in any publication, OBIS is confident that the data are the best available in electronic form. That said, the user needs sufficient knowledge to judge the appropriate use of the data, i.e. for what purpose it is fit.  Many of the data published through OBIS have voucher specimens in institutional collections and museums, images of observations, and the original identifier of the specimens is often credited or will be contactable from the data custodian.  Data ownership  Data providers retain ownership of the data provided. OBIS does not own or control or limit the use of any data or products accessible through its website. Accordingly, it does not take responsibility for the quality of such data or products, or the use that people may make of them.  Data use  Appropriate caution is necessary in the interpretation of results derived from OBIS. Users must recognize that the analysis and interpretation of data require background knowledge and expertise about marine biodiversity (including ecosystems and taxonomy). Users should be aware of possible errors, including in the use of species names, geo-referencing, data handling, and mapping. They should cross-check their results for possible errors, and qualify their interpretation of any results accordingly.  Users should be aware that OBIS is a gateway to a system of databases distributed around the world. More information on OBIS data is available from the data sources websites and contact persons. Users should email any questions concerning OBIS data or tools (e.g. maps) to the appropriate contact person and copy this request to kim.finney@aad.gov.au .  Data gaps  Major gaps in data and knowledge about the oceans are reflected in OBIS&#39; data coverage. Note the following: Most of the planet is more than 1 km under water: this deep sea is the least surveyed part of our world. Coastal areas have been adequately sampled only for the distribution of most vertebrates (birds, mammals, reptiles, larger fish). The oceans have been better sampled in the northern than the southern hemisphere, as reflected in the distribution of data in OBIS. Most marine species have not yet been recognized or named. A major effort is required to describe marine species, especially invertebrates and deep-sea organisms. Of the marine species that have been described, some have been discovered to be several species, and others combined into single species. Thus, there are changes in the application of species names over time. A checklist of all current marine species names is not available but it is estimated that 230,000 have been described. Only about half of these names have been organized into global species checklists. OBIS includes distribution data on (a) many of these validated names and (b) additional names that remain to be organized into global species checklists. Thus, OBIS has some distribution data for about one third of the known marine species. Some species distribution data are not available in any form, as they have not have been published nor made available for databases. Only some of the recently collected, and less of the older published, data have been entered into databases. Thus databases are incomplete. Of existing databases, many are not connected to OBIS.  You can help address these data gaps by (a) recognizing and encouraging scientists and organizations to make their data available online so they are accessible to OBIS, and (b) advocating for and carrying out field surveys and taxonomic studies designed to fill geographic and taxonomic gaps in knowledge. </useconst>     <ptcontac>       <cntinfo>         <cntorgp>           <cntorg>AADC</cntorg>           <cntper>Unknown</cntper>         </cntorgp>         <cntpos>Unknown</cntpos>         <cntaddr>           <addrtype>Mailing and Physical Address</addrtype>           <address>Unknown</address>           <city>Unknown</city>           <state>Unknown</state>           <postal>Unknown</postal>           <country>Unknown</country>         </cntaddr>         <cntvoice>Unknown</cntvoice>         <cntemail>kim.finney@aad.gov.au</cntemail>       </cntinfo>     </ptcontac>     <browse>       <browsen>http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/tabledap/aadcArgos.graph</browsen>       <browsed>Web page to make a customized map or graph of the data</browsed>       <browset>HTML</browset>     </browse>   </idinfo>   <dataqual>     <logic>Unknown</logic>     <complete>Unknown</complete>     <posacc>       <horizpa>         <horizpar>Unknown</horizpar>       </horizpa>       <vertacc>         <vertaccr>Unknown</vertaccr>       </vertacc>     </posacc>     <lineage>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Unknown</procdesc>         <procdate>Unknown</procdate>       </procstep>     </lineage>   </dataqual>   <spdoinfo>     <direct>Point</direct>     <ptvctinf>       <sdtstrm>         <sdtstyp>Point</sdtstyp>       </sdtstrm>     </ptvctinf>   </spdoinfo>   <distinfo>     <distrib>             <cntinfo>               <cntorgp>                 <cntorg>NOAA NMFS SWFSC Environmental Research Division</cntorg>                 <cntper>Bob Simons</cntper>               </cntorgp>               <cntpos>ERDDAP administrator</cntpos>               <cntaddr>                 <addrtype>Mailing and Physical Address</addrtype>                 <address>99 Pacific St, Suite 255A</address>                 <city>Monterey</city>                 <state>CA</state>                 <postal>93940</postal>                 <country>USA</country>               </cntaddr>               <cntvoice>+1 831-658-3205</cntvoice>               <cntemail>bob.simons@noaa.gov</cntemail>             </cntinfo>     </distrib>     <resdesc>ERDDAP, version 1.60: get metadata; download data; make graphs and maps.</resdesc>     <distliab>The data may be used and redistributed for free but is not intended for legal use, since it may contain inaccuracies.

  <metuc>The data may be used and redistributed for free but is not intended for legal use, since it may contain inaccuracies. Neither the data Contributor, ERD, NOAA, nor the United States Government, nor any of their employees or contractors, makes any warranty, express or implied, including warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, or assumes any legal liability for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness, of this information.  By using OBIS data, I agree that, in any publication or presentation of any sort based wholly or in part on such data, I will:  1. Acknowledge the use of specific records from contributing databases in the form appearing in the GLOBAL &#39;citation&#39; attribute thereof (if any); and acknowledge the use of the OBIS facility in one of the following prescribed forms:  For OBIS website:  Ocean Biogeographic Information System.

Retrieved [date accessed] from http://aadc-maps.aad.gov.au/digir/digir.php  Example:  Stocks, K. SeamountsOnline: an online information system for seamount biology. Version 3.1.

For information purposes, provide to kim.finney@aad.gov.au the full citation of any publication I make (printed or electronic) that cites OBIS or any constituent part.  3. Recognize the limitations of data in OBIS: OBIS is comparable to a scientific journal that makes data freely available on the internet. Thus the geographic and taxonomic scope, and quantity of data provided, depend on the scientists and organizations that provide data. However, in contrast to data in a journal, the &#39;reader&#39; can select and combine data in OBIS from a variety of sources. OBIS and its users give feedback on data quality and possible errors to data providers. Because data providers are willing to correct errors, the quality of the data will increase in time. How OBIS provides quality assurance, who is primarily responsible for data published in OBIS (its owners), issues to be considered in using the data, and known gaps in the data, are described below.  Quality assurance  Only data from authoritative scientists and science organizations approved by OBIS are served. All data are subject to quality control procedures before publication, and at regular intervals, with data providers informed of any discrepancies and potential errors (e.g. species names spelt incorrectly, mapping errors). OBIS also benefits from user peer-review and feedback to identify technical, geographic, and taxonomic errors in data served. However, although errors will exist as they do in any publication, OBIS is confident that the data are the best available in electronic form. That said, the user needs sufficient knowledge to judge the appropriate use of the data, i.e. for what purpose it is fit.  Many of the data published through OBIS have voucher specimens in institutional collections and museums, images of observations, and the original identifier of the specimens is often credited or will be contactable from the data custodian.  Data ownership  Data providers retain ownership of the data provided. OBIS does not own or control or limit the use of any data or products accessible through its website. Accordingly, it does not take responsibility for the quality of such data or products, or the use that people may make of them.  Data use  Appropriate caution is necessary in the interpretation of results derived from OBIS. Users must recognize that the analysis and interpretation of data require background knowledge and expertise about marine biodiversity (including ecosystems and taxonomy). Users should be aware of possible errors, including in the use of species names, geo-referencing, data handling, and mapping. They should cross-check their results for possible errors, and qualify their interpretation of any results accordingly.  Users should be aware that OBIS is a gateway to a system of databases distributed around the world. More information on OBIS data is available from the data sources websites and contact persons. Users should email any questions concerning OBIS data or tools (e.g. maps) to the appropriate contact person and copy this request to kim.finney@aad.gov.au .  Data gaps  Major gaps in data and knowledge about the oceans are reflected in OBIS&#39; data coverage. Note the following: Most of the planet is more than 1 km under water: this deep sea is the least surveyed part of our world. Coastal areas have been adequately sampled only for the distribution of most vertebrates (birds, mammals, reptiles, larger fish). The oceans have been better sampled in the northern than the southern hemisphere, as reflected in the distribution of data in OBIS. Most marine species have not yet been recognized or named. A major effort is required to describe marine species, especially invertebrates and deep-sea organisms. Of the marine species that have been described, some have been discovered to be several species, and others combined into single species. Thus, there are changes in the application of species names over time. A checklist of all current marine species names is not available but it is estimated that 230,000 have been described. Only about half of these names have been organized into global species checklists. OBIS includes distribution data on (a) many of these validated names and (b) additional names that remain to be organized into global species checklists. Thus, OBIS has some distribution data for about one third of the known marine species. Some species distribution data are not available in any form, as they have not have been published nor made available for databases. Only some of the recently collected, and less of the older published, data have been entered into databases. Thus databases are incomplete. Of existing databases, many are not connected to OBIS.  You can help address these data gaps by (a) recognizing and encouraging scientists and organizations to make their data available online so they are accessible to OBIS, and (b) advocating for and carrying out field surveys and taxonomic studies designed to fill geographic and taxonomic gaps in knowledge. </metuc>   </metainfo> </metadata> ",
