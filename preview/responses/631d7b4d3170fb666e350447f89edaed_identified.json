T. H.; L. M.; Steven; D. R.; Jon The UK is obliged to report national emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) on an annual basis under the Kyoto Protocol and EU Monitoring Mechanism. For the Agriculture sector, emissions have been estimated largely using default IPCC methodology. The recent move to using the IPCC 2006 Guideline methodology has had the effect of increasing the relative importance of methane emissions compared with nitrous oxide. Beyond these improvements to the default methodology, the UK Government has funded a large inventory improvement program to give a better representation of UK soils, climate and agricultural management practices and, in particular, to enable the UK Devolved Administrations to monitor progress towards national emission reduction targets. Data from the large measurement programs for methane and nitrous oxide emissions are currently being brought together to develop revised emission factors which will be incorporated into a restructured inventory model providing a greater spatial, temporal and sectoral resolution for UK agriculture. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Drug-Induced Exposure of Schistosoma mansoni Antigens SmCD59a and SmKK7</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27502\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Natalie</name> </author> <author> <name>Arne</name> </author> <author> <name>Beate</name> </author> <author> <name>Kristina</name> </author> <author> <name>R.

Alan; Christine; Jamal; Christoph G.; Iain W; Maria; Karl F; Cornelis H; Helmut; Gabriele BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a serious health problem especially in developing countries and affects more than 243 million people. Only few anthelmintic drugs are available up to now. A major obstacle for drug treatment is the different developmental stages and the varying host compartments during worm development. Anthelmintic drugs have been tested mainly on adult schistosomes or freshly transformed cercariae. Knowledge concerning the larval stages is lacking. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we used in vitro-grown schistosomula (aged between 2 to 14 days) to investigate drug effects of the three anthelmintics praziquantel, artemether, and oxamniquine. Further, we analyzed the antibody accessibility of two exemplary schistosome antigens SmCD59a and SmKK7, before and after drug treatment. Our results demonstrated that praziquantel applied at a concentration of 1 \\ufffd\\ufffdM inhibited development of all life stages. Application of 10 \\ufffd\\ufffdM praziquantel led to dramatic morphological changes of all schistosomula. Artemether at 1 and 10 \\ufffd\\ufffdM had differential effects depending on whether it was applied to 2-day as compared to 7- and 14-day schistosomula. While 2-day schistosomula were not killed but inhibited from further development, severe morphological damage was seen in 7- and 14-day schistosomula. Oxamniquine (1 and 10 \\ufffd\\ufffdM) led to severe morphological impairment in all life stages. Analyzing the accessibility of the antigens SmCD59a and SmKK7 before drug treatment showed no antibody binding on living intact schistosomula. However, when schistosomula were treated with anthelmintics, both antigens became exposed on the larvae. Oxamniquine turned out to be most effective in promoting antibody binding to all schistosomula stages. CONCLUSION: This study has revealed marked differences in anthelmintic drug effects against larvae. Drug treatment increases surface antigen presentation and renders larvae accessible to antibody attack. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-16T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>The Diterpenoid 7-Keto-Sempervirol, Derived from Lycium chinense, Displays Anthelmintic Activity against both Schistosoma mansoni and Fasciola hepatica</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27501\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Jennifer</name> </author> <author> <name>Martha</name> </author> <author> <name>Emily</name> </author> <author> <name>Barbara</name> </author> <author> <name>Robert J</name> </author> <author> <name>Karl F</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27501</id> <updated>2015-03-17T22:01:46Z</updated> <published>2015-03-13T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The Diterpenoid 7-Keto-Sempervirol, Derived from Lycium chinense, Displays Anthelmintic Activity against both Schistosoma mansoni and Fasciola hepatica Jennifer; Martha; Emily; Barbara; Robert J; Karl F BACKGROUND: Two platyhelminths of biomedical and commercial significance are Schistosoma mansoni (blood fluke) and Fasciola hepatica (liver fluke). These related trematodes are responsible for the chronic neglected tropical diseases schistosomiasis and fascioliasis, respectively. As no vaccine is currently available for anti-flukicidal immunoprophylaxis, current treatment is mediated by mono-chemical chemotherapy in the form of mass drug administration (MDA) (praziquantel for schistosomiasis) or drenching (triclabendazole for fascioliasis) programmes. This overreliance on single chemotherapeutic classes has dramatically limited the number of novel chemical entities entering anthelmintic drug discovery pipelines, raising significant concerns for the future of sustainable blood and liver fluke control. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that 7-keto-sempervirol, a diterpenoid isolated from Lycium chinense, has dual anthelmintic activity against related S. mansoni and F. hepatica trematodes. Using a microtiter plate-based helminth fluorescent bioassay (HFB), this activity is specific (Therapeutic index = 4.2, when compared to HepG2 cell lines) and moderately potent (LD50 = 19.1 \\ufffd\\ufffdM) against S. mansoni schistosomula cultured in vitro. This anti-schistosomula effect translates into activity against both adult male and female schistosomes cultured in vitro where 7-keto-sempervirol negatively affects motility/behaviour, surface architecture (inducing tegumental holes, tubercle swelling and spine loss/shortening), oviposition rates and egg morphology. As assessed by the HFB and microscopic phenotypic scoring matrices, 7-keto-sempervirol also effectively kills in vitro cultured F. hepatica newly excysted juveniles (NEJs, LD50 = 17.7 \\ufffd\\ufffdM). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) evaluation of adult F. hepatica liver flukes co-cultured in vitro with 7-keto-sempervirol additionally demonstrates phenotypic abnormalities including breaches in tegumental integrity and spine loss. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: 7-keto-sempervirol negatively affects the viability and phenotype of two related pathogenic trematodes responsible for significant human and animal infectious diseases. This plant-derived, natural product is also active against both larval and adult developmental forms. As such, the data collectively indicate that 7-keto-sempervirol is an important starting point for anthelmintic drug development. Medicinal chemistry optimisation of more potent 7-keto-sempervirol analogues could lead to the identification of novel chemical entities useful for future combinatorial or replacement anthelmintic control. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Evidence for root contraction in white clover (Trifolium repens L.)</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27500\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>A.</name> </author> <author> <name>N.

A.; N. R.; H.; R. B.; A. R.; B. J. White clover (Trifolium repens L.) stolons become buried in the field. It was observed that this also occurred in the greenhouse where the accepted mechanisms of burial, treading by livestock and earthworm casting, did not occur. It was also observed that the crown of seedling T. repens plants become closely appressed to the soil. Experiments showed that, regardless of variety of T. repens or depth of planting, all seedling hypocotyls first lift the cotyledons clear of the soil, then 'contract' towards the soil until the cotyledons are in contact with or below the soil surface. Auxanometers were used to measure the rate and extent of this contraction and were also attached to stolen nodes in experiments which showed that stolons move downwards relative to the soil surface and that the speed and extent of this duration varied with soil type. A further experiment showed that only rooted nodes show this behaviour. The force exerted by the contraction of nodal roots was estimated experimentally as 0.21 N g(-1) fresh root. A mechanism for the root contraction, based on examination of root anatomy of seedling tap-roots and nodal roots, is suggested. These experiments provide evidence for root contraction in T. repens which may lead to stolen burial. The importance of this to T. repens as a pasture species and as a means of further improving T. repens varieties is discussed.
