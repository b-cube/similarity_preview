As noted in an earlier <a title=\"Users and use cases: Penguin archive\" href=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/2012/07/26/users-and-use-cases-penguin-archive/\">blogpost</a>, for the Penguin Archive, the process has been unexpectedly time-consuming. The production of Linked Data requires enhancement of the collection metadata way beyond the requirements of currently accepted archival standards and, for the majority of archivists, presents a considerable technical learning curve. The key lesson for the archives community and for those promoting the creation of Linked Data is around the limitations that archivists&#8217; core values and practice, and their very constrained time, impose.</p> <p>The Penguin Archive had benefitted from a funded cataloguing post for two and a half years to transfer paper catalogue records to Calm; one of the archivists too up to a week to create new records for publication as Linked Data as part of the project.</p> <p>For both collections, free-text catalogue entries were particularly problematic; if any structure is needed, time has to be spent on extracting specific text into new fields manually, or on re-categorisation. Although the project coincided with the development of a new Drupal-based online catalogue for the Geology Museum and publication of Linked Data is therefore largely automatic, the extent of data cleaning required as part of the process came as a surprise. The project allowed for effort to be expended on data cleaning; without this effort, any Linked Data published would have been of very limited use, even though publication is largely automatic through the additional Drupal module. Even where structure exists internally to collection data, there are still issues of linking these with third party datasets.</p> <p>One recommendation may be for JISC to support a project to identify the amount of effort required for the creation and publication of Linked Data for different types of collections.</p> <p>Overall, the message from both use cases is that the creation of Linked Data, links to authority files and to third party datasets should not be considered a quick and easy solution. Future upgrades of products such as Calm may well integrate creation and publication of Linked Data\\ufffd\\ufffdwithout\\ufffd\\ufffdthere needing to be a separate process; without this, it is unlikely that data from collections like the Penguin Archive, where much human intervention is needed, will be published as Linked Data.</p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/2012/10/15/lessons-learned-linked-data-hosting/\">  <title>Lessons learned: linked data hosting</title>  <link>http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/2012/10/15/lessons-learned-linked-data-hosting/</link>  <dc:date>2012-10-15T10:40:01Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator><![CDATA[Lesly Huxley]]></dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Linked Data]]></dc:subject>  <description><![CDATA[The hosting review workpackage had originally identified Talis as the main option for external hosting.

Talis wound up development of its external hosting platform during the Bricolage project&#8217;s lifetime, so this was no longer an option. The sustainability or otherwise of hosting and other platforms in relatively experimental areas of work is something to consider for future projects; having several options, in this case including internal hosting solutions, helps reduce risk of not being able to deliver on project plans.

For now here are some screenshots and a little more detail&#8230;</p> <h2>Penguin Archive Timeline</h2> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/files/2012/08/PAT1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-148\" title=\"Penguin Archive Timeline\" src=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/files/2012/08/PAT1-300x196.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"196\" /></a></p> <p>The Penguin Archive Timeline uses the freely available <a href=\"http://timeline.verite.co/\">TimelineJS</a>\\ufffd\\ufffdto present an interactive chronology of key events in the history of Penguin Books. Its construction involved the following steps:</p> <ul> <li>The collection curators created a spreadsheet containing the key events, their dates and (optionally) an illustrative image. The event data also included the unique collection identifiers of any related collection held in the archive. These identifiers would later provide a route to the Linked Data.</li> <li>The spreadsheet was then parsed into a JSON data structure understandable by the TimelineJS javascript application. <pre>{ \"startDate\":\"1863\", \"endDate\":\"\", \"headline\":\"Birth of Samuel Lane\", \"text\":\"&lt;span class='lod' res='gb-3-dm2244;gb-3-dm1649;gb-3-dm1676'&gt;&lt;img style='border:none;' class='throbber' src='img/throbber.gif'/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\" }</pre> </li> <li>Loading this data (and hosting the linked images) gave us the basic chronology, but without any sign of Linked Data so far! Now to use the supplied collection codes.</li> <li>A small edit was made to TimelineJS to provide a callback upon event data load. This callback gives us the chance to query the Linked Data service. E.g. <pre>/elda/api/penguin/id/archivalresource/gb-3-dm2309.json</pre> </li> <li>\\ufffd\\ufffdThe JSON returned from the call is then parsed and used to populate the timeline (the embedded box in the image above). <pre>{ \"format\" : \"linked-data-api\", \"version\" : \"0.2\", \"result\" : {   \"_about\" : \"http://tc-bricol.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/elda/api/penguin/id/archivalresource/gb-3-dm2309.json\",   \"dc_title\" : \"Pelican Books, Penguin Books, Penguin Handbooks, Penguin Specials, Pan Books, and other materials\",   \"extent\" : \"4 records management boxes (359 books)\",   ...   } }</pre> </li> </ul> <p>So the demonstrator shows the possibility of augmenting a purely browser-based application with rich, structured data.</p> <p>Javascript libraries used: jquery-1.7.2, TimelineJS.</p> <p>This demonstrator will be made publicly available via the <a href=\"http://www.bris.ac.uk/library/resources/specialcollections/archives/penguin/\">Penguin Archive</a> site in September. All associated code will also shortly be available under an Open Source licence.</p> <h2>A map interface for the Geology Collection</h2> <p><a href=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/files/2012/08/GD1.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-163\" title=\"Geology demonstrator\" src=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/files/2012/08/GD1-300x160.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"160\" /></a></p> <p>The Geology demonstrator provides a map-based route into the museum&#8217;s collection. As with the Penguin demonstrator, it is a javascript-based browser app that is backed by the Linked Data created by the project. The steps involved in creating the demonstrator were as follows:</p> <ul> <li>The existing catalogue only had textual place name information. As part of the project this data was reviewed and somewhat cleaned. Then, in order to be able to locate the resources on a map, the place names were passed through a geocoding service.

It holds historically and scientifically important collections that are unique to the institution. The museum holds an estimated 100,000 museum specimens, many of which are unique and of international importance. Highlights include: an estimated 20,000 invertebrate fossils including material with important historical associations, over 4,500 mineral specimens, including many display-quality items from nowadays inaccessible mines, over 3,000 vertebrate fossils and casts and the Fry collection of over 4,000 invertebrate and plant fossils from the UK. There is also an extensive teaching collection of 16,000 specimens. Over the past 15 years 41,420 digital records have been produced on the basis of historic museum registers, card index catalogues and specimen labels. The creation of digital metadata has focused on valuable specimens and collection of national or international importance. These records represent about two thirds of the entire collection. Each metadata record contains information in 30 categories, 18 of which will be published by this project.</p> <p>The School of Earth Sciences is already undertaking work to enhance the online presence of the Geology Museum by improving the museum website and online access to the collections. Included in this work is the migration of the existing collection metadata into a Drupal backed system, which can be used to publish Linked Data automatically.</p> <p>Initial work focused on moving data from existing spreadsheet format into the Drupal database. Issues arise in the formats used, including free text, and the need to restrict terminology. There is a huge amount of data but it is largely unstructured, so requires manual effort to review and test. Unlike the <a href=\"http://bricolage.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/2012/06/28/users-and-use-cases-2-the-penguin-archive/\">Penguin Archive use case</a>, the export and publication processes are largely automated by Drupal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds in-built modules for handling RDF, returning it in response to a Linked Data request. The aim is to embed data from the catalogue in the Geology Museum\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds new public website using schema.org metadata in the HTML of the site, so that large search engines can find structured data.</p> <p>The Collections &amp; Practicals Manager in the School of Earth Sciences has suggested that a map demonstrator would be useful for the Geology Museum Linked Data. She is concerned, however, that much of the geo-location data about the collection is embedded as free text in description fields, which would make it difficult to plot the data on a map consistently, if at all. She has proposed using geodata for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtype specimen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd data for the centre of the UK, although this also raises questions about the level of resolution at which these data could be plotted: for some, the catalogue may only include data about the nearest town or village rather than a precise geolocation related to OS references. Given the Museum\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds relationships with local schools and geology enthusiast\\ufffd\\ufffd groups, one way of resolving this issue \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and assisting the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdclean up\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of the data and giving information on use of the site overall \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd could be to invite these \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdend users\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to provide feedback and correct location data via the site. She has arranged a meeting with one such group in July which could provide a starting point for this. It will need to be made clear to any users beyond the Museum staff, however, that the demonstrators are not at \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfull service grade\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.</p> <p>The Collection Manager has engaged fully with the project, participating in Advisory Board meetings, 1-1 meetings with the development team and piloting and providing feedback on data migration to Drupal. The demonstrator will provide a concrete example of how Linked Data published via Drupal can be used but evaluation of the value of embedding microdata to facilitate search engine optimisation is unlikely to extend beyond the lifetime of the project.</p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
