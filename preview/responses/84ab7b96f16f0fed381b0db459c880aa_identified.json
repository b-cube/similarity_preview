This speech was written by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> on behalf of the son of the plaintiff, <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name>. The son is representing his father in the suit that the father has brought against <name type=\"person\">Leochares</name>. The case involves a dispute over the inheritance of the estate of a certain <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>. <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name>, the great-grandnephew of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name> is suing <name type=\"person\">Leochares</name>, the great-great-grandnephew of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>, who, through a series of three posthumous adoptions, is attempting to have himself declared the legally adopted son of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>. <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>, who left no heirs, was survived by two male relatives: a brother, <name type=\"person\">Meidylides</name>, and the grandson of his sister <name type=\"person\">Archidice</name>, whose name was <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>. According to Athenian law, the brother, <name type=\"person\">Meidylides</name>, was designated the heir, being more closely related than <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>, who was the grandson of a sister (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 44\" n=\"Dem. 44.2\">Dem. 44.2</bibl>). However, at the time of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>&#8217; death, <name type=\"person\">Meidylides</name> was out of the country. <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>, through posthumous adoption (see also <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 43\" n=\"Dem. 43\">Dem. 43</bibl> for another such instance), had himself declared the adopted son of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name> and assumed control of the estate. <name type=\"person\">Meidylides</name>, upon his return to the city, was persuaded not to pursue justice on his own behalf but rather to consent to the circumstances. He and his grandson <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name> (the plaintiff in this case) remained passive while the family of <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name> continued to hold on to the estate of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>. <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name> transferred the clan and deme membership of his son <name type=\"person\">Leostratus</name> to that of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>, thus giving <name type=\"person\">Leostratus</name> the legal status of an adopted son of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>. <name type=\"person\">Leostratus</name>, in turn, did the same for his son <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name> (who was named after his grandfather). <name type=\"person\">Leocrates</name>, the grandson, died without heirs, at which time <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name> stepped forward to claim the estate as the nearest of kin to the deceased <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>. However, <name type=\"person\">Leostratus</name> sought to prevent the estate from passing out of his family by attempting to have his younger son, <name type=\"person\">Leochares</name>, declared to be the adopted son of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>. In order to counter this action, <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name> brought <name type=\"person\">Leochares</name> into court by filing an affidavit of objections (<foreign lang=\"grc\">diamarturi/a</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 44\" n=\"Dem. 44.1\">Dem. 44.1</bibl>; also <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 44\" n=\"Dem. 44.5\">Dem. 44.5</bibl>). During the trial, the speaker argues that, by lineage, <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name> is much more closely related to <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name> than is <name type=\"person\">Leochares</name>, who is only the great-great-grandson of <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>&#8217; sister. Furthermore, the speaker states that <name type=\"person\">Leochares</name>&#8217; <soCalled>adoption</soCalled> as <name type=\"person\">Archiades</name>&#8217; son, which only took place after the suit had been filed by <name type=\"person\">Aristodemus</name>, could only originate from dishonest motives.
