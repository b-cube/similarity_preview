The cruise took place  August 12-30, 2011 aboard the R/V Wecoma. Ninety-five stations were occupied from northern Washington to southern California along thirteen transect lines. At all stations, CTD  casts were conducted, and discrete water samples were collected in Niskin bottles. The cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical  parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm. During the cruise, some of the same transect lines were occupied as during the 2007 West Coast Carbon  cruise, as well as many CalCOFI stations. This effort was conducted in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP).</abstract>     <purpose>The major objectives of the cruise were: 1) To characterize ocean acidification (OA) conditions on the U.S. West Coast; 2) To conduct inter-calibration measurements near other OA observing assets, including gliders and moorings, in the study area, allowing inter-calibration of these autonomous assets with high-quality, ship-based measurements; 3) To provide calibration data needed to develop predictive models for aragonite saturation state, pH, and other important OA indicators in the California Current System, based on widely measured parameters such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen concentration; 4) To examine relationships between processes leading to OA and hypoxia in coastal ecosystems; 5) To conduct biological measurements in conjunction with physical and chemical OA measurements; and 6) To provide scientific information on OA conditions and trends for resource management and decision support.</purpose>     <startdate>8/12/2011</startdate>    <enddate>8/30/2011</enddate>     <westbd>-127.55</westbd>    <eastbd>-117.75</eastbd>    <northbd>48.38</northbd>    <southbd>31.95</southbd>     <spatialReference>WGS 84</spatialReference>     <geographicName>U.S. West Coast California Current System</geographicName>    <geographicName>North Pacific Ocean</geographicName>     <fundingAgency>       <agency>NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program</agency>       <title>Ocean Acidification Monitoring Network: West Coast Hydrographic Cruise </title>       <ID>OAPFY11.01.PMEL.003</ID>    </fundingAgency>        <fundingAgency>       <agency>NOAA's Global Carbon Cycle Program</agency>       <title>N/A</title>       <ID>#GC10-102</ID>    </fundingAgency>     <researchProject>none</researchProject>     <Platform>       <PlatformName>Wecoma</PlatformName>       <PlatformID>32WC</PlatformID>       <PlatformType>Research vessel</PlatformType>       <PlatformOwner>National Science Foundation</PlatformOwner>       <PlatformCountry>USA</PlatformCountry>    </Platform>           <expocode>32WC20110812</expocode>    <cruiseID>WCOA2011</cruiseID>    <section>West Coast Ocean Acidification Cruise (WCOA) </section>    <citation>Feely, Richard A.; Alin, Simone R.; Hales, Burke; Johnson, Gregory C.; Juranek, Lauren W.; Byrne, Robert; Peterson, William T.;  Goni, Miguel; Liu, Xuewu; and Greeley, Dana (2014).

DICE was developed by Esa Peltola and Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana Greeley of  NOAA/PMEL to modernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA (Johnson et al. 1985, 1987, 1993, and 1999; Johnson 1992)</analyzingInstrument>       <detailedInfo>Samples for DIC measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the 2007 PICES Special Publication, Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements, from Niskin bottles into 310 ml borosilicate glass flasks using silicone tubing. The flasks were rinsed once and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain any bubbles, overflowing by at least one-half volume. The sample tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating a ~7.5 ml headspace and 0.133 ml of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease. DIC samples were collected from variety of depths with approximately 10% of these samples taken as duplicates. The accuracy of the DICE measurement is determined with the use of standards (Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV irradiated seawater) supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The CRM accuracy is determined manometrically on land in San Diego and the DIC data reported to the data base have been corrected to this batch 109 CRM value.  The CRM certified value for this batch is 2026.33umol/kg. During this cruise both systems reported values which were consistently lower than the certified value. This offset we believe to be due to the fact that the temperature of the gas loop housing was offset from the lab temperature in which the gas cylinder was kept. As the gas loops and CRM values were consistent throughout, we have great confidence in our final value after correcting for this CRM offset. Summary  The overall performance of the analytical equipment was good during the cruise.  We were able to sample every niskin Niskin made available to us; and including the duplicates and samples drawn from the underway seawater line, 1450 samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon. </detailedInfo>       <replicate>Duplicate samples were collected from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled, as a check of our precision.  These replicate samples were interspersed throughout the station analysis for quality assurance and integrity of the coulometer cell solutions. The average absolute difference from the mean of these replicates is 1.04umol/kg.  No systematic differences between the replicates were observed.</replicate>       <standard>          <description>Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.999%) by means of an 8-port valve (Wilke et al., 1993) outfitted with two calibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1ml and ~2ml).

The specific method used was based upon the open-cell method described by Dickson et al (2003). This method involves first acidifying the sample to reduce the sample pH to less than 3.6 followed by bubbling CO2-free air through the sample to facilitate removal of the CO2 evolved by the acid addition.  After removal of the carbonate species from solution, the titration proceeds until a pH of less than 3.0 is attained, and the equivalence point evaluated from titration points in the pH region 3.0-3.5 using a non-linear least squares procedure that corrects for the reactions with sulfate and fluoride ions (Dickson et al. 2003).  Titration progress is monitored by measuring the electromotive force (E) of a combination glass-reference electrode.   Samples were drawn from the Niskin-type bottles into cleaned 250-ml borosilicate glass bottles using Tygon tubing with silicone ends.  Bottles were rinsed twice and filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume and taking care not to entrain any bubbles.  The sample tube was closed off and withdrawn from the sample bottle, creating a 5 ml headspace.  Samples were preserved by poisoning with 0.133 ml of a saturated HgCl2 solution.  Sample bottles were sealed with glass stoppers lightly coated with Apiezon-L grease, and were stored at room temperature (21-25 degrees Celsius) for a maximum of 12 hours prior to analysis.   Titrations were carried out in water-jacketed, 250-ml beakers.  The beakers were kept at 24.0 minus/plus  0.2 degrees Celsius with water from a constant temperature bath.   Prior to analysis, samples were placed in the water bath to bring them to the same temperature as the reaction beakers.  Seawater samples were dispensed into the water-jacketed beaker using a fixed volume glass syringe. A Metrohm Dosimat 765 was used to deliver acid to the sample beaker in increments of 0.040 ml.  The acid titrant used was 0.1 mol/kg HCl prepared in 0.6 mol/kg NaCl background to approximate the ionic strength of seawater (0.7 mol/kg).    Instrument control and data acquisition was with custom software developed in Andrew Dickson's laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and modified by a former employee of the NOAA/PMEL Carbon Group using the National Instruments LabView programming environment. Over the course of the cruise we analyzed over 1,500 samples, including duplicate samples and certified reference materials (CRMs).  Typical titrations were completed in 10-14 minutes and required 20-24 acid additions to reach a pH of 3.0. 1,256 values were reported to the database.   </detailedInfo>       <replicate>We collected and analyzed duplicate samples from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled.</replicate>       <standard>          <description>Analytical accuracy was assessed by periodic analysis of Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) throughout the cruise. CRMs were analyzed approximately every 24 samples.  For this CRM batch, the average offset for system 1 was 1.16 with a standard deviation of 1.24. The average offset for system 2 was 0.21 with a standard deviation of 1.67.</description>          <frequency>All values were directly measured with reference to Certified Reference Material (Dickson, SIO)</frequency>          <crm>             <manufacturer>Andrew Dickson's lab at Scripps Institute of Oceanography</manufacturer>             <batch></batch>          </crm>       </standard>       <poison>          <poisonName>Mercuric Chloride Solution</poisonName>          <volume>0.133 ml</volume>          <correction>The TA values were corrected for dilution by 0.133 ml of saturated HgCl2 used for sample preservation.

Seawater samples were collected from the Niskin bottles directly in 10-cm cylindrical optical cells (~30 mL volume) using a section of silicone tubing (about 15 cm long). One end of the silicone tubing was attached to the optical cell and the other end was attached to the nipple of the Niskin bottle. The Niskin bottle nipple was pushed in to initiate flow and the silicone tubing was squeezed to eliminate air bubbles. The optical cell was agitated to eliminate bubbles and, after 15 seconds of sample flow, the cell was capped at one end. The silicone tubing was then detached from the optical cell and, with the water still flowing, the cap was rinsed and used to seal the optical cell. Samples collected this way were not exposed to the atmosphere, and each cell was flushed with approximately three cell volumes of seawater. The samples were collected, taken into the lab, and rinsed with tap water to get rid of salt outside of the cells. The cells were dried and the optical windows were cleaned with Kimwipes. Samples were thermostatted at 25 (minus/plus 0.05) degrees Celsius in a custom made 36-position cell warmer. A custom macro program running on Agilent ChemStation was used to guide the measurements and data processing. The macro automated the procedures of sample input, blank and sample scans, quality control, and data archiving. The quality control steps included checking the baseline shift after dye injection and monitoring the standard deviation of multiple scans. Absorbance blanks were taken for each sample and 10 microliters of purified m-cresol purple (10 mmol/kg) were added for the analysis. pHT (total scale) was calculated according to Liu et al.

Also, a quartz crystal temperature signal is used to compensate for a wide range of temperature changes.  Repeatability, hysteresis, and pressure conformance are 0.005% FS.

Because the outer electrodes are connected together, electric fields are confined inside the cell.  The cell resistance controls the output frequency of a Wien Bridge oscillator circuit.  The sensor has a frequency output of approximately 3 to 12 kHz corresponding to conductivities from 0 to 7 Siemens/meter (0 to 70 mmho/cm).  The conductivity sensor has a typical accuracy/stability of 0.0003 S/m per month, and resolution of 0.00004 S/m at 24 Hz.  Discrete conductivity data were averaged over an 8-second interval, minus/plus 4 seconds of the sample confirm bit.    An overall linear fit of CTD and bottle data, including a station-dependent slope and pressure bias,  produced the best results for stations 1-79; an overall linear fit, including a pressure bias, produced the best results for stations 80-95.  The fitting routine recursively throws out data greater than 2.8 standard deviations and returns a single conductivity bias and a conductivity slope for each station.  A station-dependent slope coefficient best models the gradual shift in the conductivity sensor within each station grouping with time.  A linear pressure term (modified beta) that is multiplied by CTD pressure and added to conductivity may also be warranted. The order of the polynomial was chosen to keep the standard deviation of each grouping to a minimum while avoiding fitting to fluctuations due to noise in standardizations of salinity sample runs.

Two samples were collected from each cast, one from the surface mixed layer and one from the deepest Niskin.  Samples were collected in 200 ml Kimax high-alumina borosilicate bottles, sealed with custom clear plastic inserts and Nalgene caps, and externally rinsed with fresh water to reduce salt contamination.  Salinity samples were allowed to equilibrate in an open tray on the counter next to the Autosal for a minimum of eight hours.  A batch of samples was run roughly every third to fifth day of the cruise.  A total of 186 sample salinity measurements were made during this cruise.    The Autosal bath temperature was set to 21degrees Celsius.  An air conditioner was mounted in the van to regulate temperature around 19-21degrees Celsius.  Fluctuations were monitored using a wall-mounted thermometer.  A logging thermometer recorded ambient temperature in 10-minute increments during a run, which usually remained stable to within 1degrees Celsius.  Power to the Autosal was conditioned through a UPS to reduce noise in the readings.  An Ocean Scientific Instruments interface box connected the Autosal to a laptop with ACI2003 software installed.    After initiating the software program, a bottle of standard seawater (batch P147) was used to determine an offset correction to be applied to the following measurements.  Each water sample was flushed through the Autosal's conductivity cell 3-5 times before taking the first reading. After waiting five seconds, ten seconds of 4 Hz data (40 values) were averaged for a conductivity ratio.  Three corrected conductivity ratios were averaged and one salinity value was calculated for each water sample.  After all samples were analyzed, a second bottle of standard seawater was run.  A linear fit with time between the pre and post standards was found and the slope and offset was applied to all samples run. A dilute solution of Triton-X surfactant was flushed through the cell at the end of each session, followed by 400 ml distilled water.  Distilled water remained in the cell between uses.  186 discrete salinity samples were run to validate CTD observations.  </detailedInfo>       <replicate></replicate>       <uncertainty></uncertainty>       <flag>Bot_Salt_QC, WOCE quality control flags are used: 2 = good value, 3 = questionable value, 4 = bad value, 5 = value not reported, 6 = mean of replicate measurements, 9 = sample not drawn.</flag>       <methodReference></methodReference>       <biologicalSubject></biologicalSubject>       <speciesID></speciesID>       <researcherName>Kristene McTaggart</researcherName>       <researcherInstitution>Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; PI: Gregory C.

A description of this method can be found at Holser et al, 2011. A discussion of the results was given at  Ocean Sciences, Welch et al 2011. In the case of the Niskin samples, we analyzed sub-samples of filters for POC/PON analyses and the  remaining fractions are being analyzed now for sterols.  Analysis Procedure: For POC and PON analyses, water was sampled from dedicated Niskin bottles by emptying the contents of the bottle into  carboys from the bottom (to avoid potential under sampling of settled particles.  Large volume sub-samples of the water (1,000 to 8,000 mL),  taken after mixing in a carboy, were filtered onto 47 mm 0.45 micron glass fiber filters under vacuum. Samples were placed in individual  Petri dishes and kept frozen until analyses.  Prior to analysis, filters were oven-dried at 60degrees Celsius overnight until no change in  weight was measurable.  The diameter of the sample filter area in each filter was measured with a caliper and an exact proportion of that  area sub-sampled for elemental (carbon and nitrogen) analysis. Replicate (2-4) cuttings from each filter were used to obtain representative  sub-samples for analyses. The area ratio of total vs. sub-sampled filter was used to calculate concentrations of measured constituents.  Organic analysis comprised determination of total organic carbon and nitrogen contents by high-temperature combustion of acid-treated samples  that were placed in silver boats (Goni et al., 2008; Holser et al., 2011). After acidification, samples were dried at 60degrees Celsius for  24-36h, placed into tin boats, and folded in preparation for analyses. Organic carbon and nitrogen contents were measured by flash combustion  at 1020degrees Celsius using a NC2500 elemental analyzer (CE Instruments) controlled by the EAS Clarity software (Costech analytical  technologies Inc) and the instrumental setup of Verardo et al. (1990). A series of standards (L-cystine N:11.66%, C:29.99%, Atropine N:4.84%,  C:70.56% and Goni Lab TM secondary low C standard N:0.119%, C:1.298%) and boat blanks were analyzed in each run to calibrate the analyzer  response. We analyzed cuttings of blank, pre-combusted filters to determine carbon and nitrogen contents of the glass fiber and used to  correct the contents of the filter samples.  In all cases, the C contents of the blank filters were less than 5% of the sample signals  whereas there was no measurable N in the blank filters. Analyses of replicate samples showed standard errors of less than 5% of measured  value for both N and C. 257 values were reported to the database. </detailedInfo>       <replicate></replicate>       <uncertainty>plus minus less than 5%</uncertainty>       <flag></flag>       <methodReference></methodReference>       <biologicalSubject></biologicalSubject>       <speciesID></speciesID>       <researcherName>Miguel Goni</researcherName>       <researcherInstitution>Oregon State University, College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences</researcherInstitution>    </variable>     <variable>       <abbrev>POC umol/L</abbrev>       <fullname>Particulate Organic Carbon Concentration</fullname>       <controlledName></controlledName>       <observationType></observationType>       <insitu>In-situ observation</insitu>       <unit>micromol/L</unit>       <measured>Measured</measured>       <samplingInstrument>Niskin Bottle</samplingInstrument>       <analyzingInstrument>NC2500 elemental analyzer (CE Instruments) controlled by the EAS Clarity software (Costech analytical technologies  Inc)</analyzingInstrument>       <duration></duration>       <detailedInfo>POC and PON were typically collected from the Niskin bottles at three depths on each cast (surface, chl max, and bottom  boundary layer - nearest the bed).  A description of this method can be found at Holser et al, 2011. A discussion of the results was given at  Ocean Sciences, Welch et al 2011. In the case of the Niskin samples, we analyzed sub-samples of filters for POC/PON analyses and the  remaining fractions are being analyzed now for sterols.  Analysis Procedure: For POC and PON analyses, water was sampled from dedicated Niskin bottles by emptying the contents of the bottle into  carboys from the bottom (to avoid potential under sampling of settled particles.  Large volume sub-samples of the water (1,000 to 8,000 mL),  taken after mixing in a carboy, were filtered onto 47 mm 0.45 micron glass fiber filters under vacuum. Samples were placed in individual  Petri dishes and kept frozen until analyses.  Prior to analysis, filters were oven-dried at 60degrees Celsius overnight until no change in  weight was measurable.  The diameter of the sample filter area in each filter was measured with a caliper and an exact proportion of that  area sub-sampled for elemental (carbon and nitrogen) analysis. Replicate (2-4) cuttings from each filter were used to obtain representative  sub-samples for analyses. The area ratio of total vs. sub-sampled filter was used to calculate concentrations of measured constituents.
