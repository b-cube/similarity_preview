But in the 1620s at the request of  Charles I, the miniaturist Peter Oliver painted copies of oil paintings in the King&#39;s collection. Charles was a great connoisseur and this request reflects the value he placed on his collection and on the exquisite watercolour art of miniature painting.  This established the tradition of copying great paintings in miniature.  People  Horace Walpole was a collecter, particularly of portraits.  His collection of miniatures was in his own words &#39;the largest and finest in the country&#39;.  Although this miniature was sold at the sale held at Walpole&#39;s home in 1842, unfortunately it is not mentioned in Walpole&#39;s own catalogue in 1784, nor in the 1800 catalogue compiled after his death.  So it is unclear if it actually belonged to Walpole.  Ownership &amp; Use  Walpole&#39;s interest in this miniature would have been as much with the sitter as the artist.  Antoine Triest was a notable collector and friend of  artists such as van Dyck.  Walpole avidly collected  likenesses of the famous and often commissioned copies himself.  In contrast, Charles Beale probably painted his copy in miniature of this famous image as a homage to the painterly skill of van Dyck. He probably copied an oil copy belonging to his father who referred in his diary to &#39;my bishops picture of Van Dykes&#39;.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history>The Excellent Mrs Mary Beale (Geffrye Museum 1975-1976)</exhibition_history>              <bibliography>Murdoch, John.

No. 148 [555-1905]), the attribution to Charles Beale the Younger was first published by Goulding, who did not, however, comment on the difference between this version of the &lt;i&gt;CB&lt;/i&gt;monogram - a variant of the type identified by Vertue as belonging to Beale the Younger, but with the upper end of the &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; failing to complete its loop back on to the vertical stroke, and thus failing to make the &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; clearly; and those which he otherwise recognised. Basil Long (1 930) was aware of the difference but did not dissent from Goulding&#39;s judgement. Neither commented on stylistic matters, although prima facie the &lt;i&gt;Lely&lt;/i&gt; is painted in a bold, direct hatch with some stipple blended in, while the &lt;i&gt;Triest&lt;/i&gt;, which perhaps experimentally even lacks a vellum, is painted predominantly in a soft stipple that blurs rather than accentuates the sitter&#39;s features and the fall of light and shade. When taken in combination with the two &lt;i&gt;Lauderdale&lt;/i&gt; portraits (Cat. Nos 150 and 151), they give an impression that Beale was an unusually protean artist. All are catalogued here as by Charles Beale the Younger, an attribution that has received the recent support of Elizabeth Walsh and Richard Jeffree (1975-6) and which it does not yet seem possible to question substantially. As Croft-Murray and Hulton (1960) point out, the source for this miniature was probably the &#39;Bishops picture of Van Dykes&#39; referred to in the diary of Charles Beale the Elder, 20 April 1672: Mr. Lely was here. (meaning I think) to see Mrs. Beal (&amp; her workers) with Mr. Gibson and Mr. Skipwith to see us ... Mr. Lely told me at the same time as he was most studiously looking at my Bishops picture of Van Dykes - and I chanced to ask him how Sr. Anthony could possibly divise to finish in one day a face that was so exceeding full of work &amp; wrought up to so extraordinary a p[er]fection. I believe (sd he) he painted it over 14 times. (2)  There are several versions of the painting from which Charles Beale (the Elder) could have worked, for example one sold at Sotheby&#39;s 16 March 1966, lot 20, which may have been the prime version, for it was said to have been formerly in the possession of Antoine Triest&#39;s descendants. There is also a drawing in the British Museum series (3), convincingly attributed to Charles Beale the Younger. It would presumably have been copied from the same version of the painting as the miniature. Interestingly, in this drawing, the use of red and black chalks, with some graphite in long, elongated strokes, stumped and rubbed in order to soften the chiaroscuro, relates closely to the technique, despite the difference in medium, of the Lauderdale miniatures. It is closer to them than it is to the copy of the same portrait, the present miniature.   Antoine Triest, 5th Bishop of Bruges, 7th Bishop of Ghent (Gand), was born in 1576 at the Chateau of Ten Walle at Beveren-Waes. He was the son of Philippe, seigneur of Anweghem, by his wife Marie van Royen. He was noticed as a young priest by Ferdinand and Isabella, who made him their Court chaplain and in due course despatched him to Rome to acquire ecclesiastical finish. In 1616/17 he became Bishop of Bruges, where he proved an energetic administrator and improver of the fabric of the Cathedral. In 1620 he was translated to Ghent. He was a man of broad culture, a keen botanist and gardener and an active patron of the arts.   He counted among his friends Rubens, van Dyck, Teniers and their colleagues, and paid generously for the paintings which he commissioned from them. Rubens painted for him the &lt;i&gt;Conversion of St Paul&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Massacre of the Innocents&lt;/i&gt;. Van Dyck and Teniers painted his portrait ... he commissioned his own funeral monument from Jerome Duquesnoy for 8000 florins. The Triest mausoleum, finished in 1654, is in the opinion of Kervyn de Volkaersbeke &#39;the most beautiful work of the national (school of) statuary&#39;. (4)  As well as painting his portrait in large, Van Dyck included Triest among the artists and patrons in the etched and engraved portraits of the &lt;i&gt;Iconographia&lt;/i&gt;.   1 Cf. monogram on Cat.

He became a member of the Arte dei Medici e degli Speziali in 1442 and of the Guild of St Luke in 1443. Marco del Buono (1402-1489) joined the Guild of St Luke in 1443. Together they run the most important workshop in fifteenth-century Florence from at least 1446. They produced decorated furniture panels (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdforzieri/cassoni\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, wedding chests, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddeschi da parto\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, birth trays, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdspalliere\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, wainscotting) as well as illuminated manuscripts.

The following is the full text of the entry:  &quot;PANEL B  WORKSHOP OF APOLLONIO DI GIOVANNI  &lt;i&gt;Florentine School&lt;/i&gt;  CASSONE PANEL: THE CONTINENCE OF SCIPIO Tempera on poplar, 43.5 x 133 cm  5804-1859   The Continence of Scipio (Panel B), was a subject rarely depicted by 15th-century artists, even on cassone. Classical authors relate how Scipio, whose name, &#39;Scipione&#39;, is inscribed on his hat, desired Lucretia as his own. However when informed of her betrothal to Allucius, Scipio nobly restored Lucretia to him, and returned to her parents her ransom of gold. Thus, beside the oriental carpet, stands a gold chest. True nobility lies, not in wealth and status - &#39;Seven or eight yards of scarlet will make a new citizen,&#39; remarked Cosimo de Medici - but in the Renaissance ideal of exemplary virtue. The confident treatment of architecture and perspective in Figure B (C.1463-70) is that of Florence&#39;s leading workshop and its master, Apollonio de Giovanni. Its uninterrupted, rectangular format reflects Alberti&#39;s recommendations in &lt;i&gt;Della Pittura&lt;/i&gt;, also a desirable affinity with classical sarcaphogi, and familiarity with Ghiberti&#39;s doors for the Florentine Baptistry. Ghiberti had abandoned cusped quatrefoils for unified compositions, one of which, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, is reflected on two other cassone in the Museum. The earlier Florentine panel (c. 1430), possibly from the vorkshop of the Master of the Grigg&#39;s Crucifixion, has a twodimensional quality. It retains the cusped divisions characterisic of the Gothic style, and medieval symbolism is perpetuated in the figure of Constancy, with column and inscribed scroll.   Muted reds and greens predominate in Panel A; gilding is restricted to the surrounding carved gesso panels. The Scipio panel glistens with gold, applied by the &lt;i&gt;mettodoro&lt;/i&gt; after the painter had worked the colours. These are more varied, reflecting light and shade, and further embellished with punched motifs, a technique also used on small Renaissance caskets in the Museum, and by all &lt;i&gt;cassone&lt;/i&gt; workshops.

The following is the full text of the entry:  APOLLONIO di Giovanni (1415-65)  Florentine School  In 1902 Aby Warburg published the records of a Florentine cassone workshop which contained a complete list of objects produced between 1446 and 1463 by the owners of the shop, Marco del Buono Giamberti and Apollonio di Giovanni. Schubring also published this list, but did not succeed in identifying any of its items with a known cassone.       In 1944 W. Stechow published a convincing identification of a cassone in the Oberlin collection with one of the items in this list, thus for the first time attaching a distinct style to the workshop. More recently, E. H. Gombrich drew attention to a poem by the humanist Ugolino Verino which describes the work of the &#39;Tuscan Apelles Apollonius&#39; and which enabled him to identify Apollonio, rather than his partner Marco del Buono, as the artist of the principal works in this group: the &lt;i&gt;Aeneid&lt;/i&gt; cassone in the Jarves Collection, Yale University, as well as the Vergil manuscript in the Riccardiana, Florence (MS. 492). E. H. Gombrich supports the view originally propounded by Offner that several of Schubring&#39;s categories - The &#39;Dido Master&#39;, the &#39;Master of the Tournament of Piazza S. Croce&#39; and the &#39;Cassone Master&#39; - all originated in the same workshop, which Berenson designated as headed by the &#39;Master of the Jarves Cassoni&#39;. The evidence now at our disposal leaves little doubt that this was the workshop of Apollonio di Giovanni, which was one of the busiest in mid-15th century Florence.   Lit. A.

Workshop of APOLLONIO di Giovanni   9  CASSONE PANEL: THE CONTINENCE OF SCIPIO  Tempera on poplar Size of panel 17 1/8 x 52 3/8 (43.5 x 133);  painted surface 16 x 51 (40.6 x 129.5);  thickness 5/8 (1.6)  5804-1859  On the left Scipio (indicated by an inscription SCIPIONE) stands by the carpet, which is covered with gold objects sent as ransom for Lucretia by her parents. Scipio both returned the ransom to the parents and Lucretia to her bridegroom Allucius (Livy 26:50; Valerius Maximus IV.3.I.). The couple stand on the opposite side of the carpet, while the right half of the picture is devoted to their wedding.       Like so many others, this panel once bore an ascription to Dello Delli, presumably because Vasari had described him as the inventor of cassone painting. Schiaparelli (1908) attributed it to the follower of Pesellino responsible for the Solomon cassone (7852-1862; no. 121) and various other related works. Schubring grouped it with a cassone in the Jarves Collection, Yale University, which he described as representing the Tournament of Piazza S. Croce, Florence. Subsequent authorities have attempted to reduce Schubring&#39;s categories. Offner (1927) attributed this panel to the Dido (Vergil) Master on the grounds of its similarity with the &lt;i&gt;Aeneid&lt;/i&gt; cassone in the Jarves Collection, and Berenson (1932) described this group as studio of the Master of the Jarves Cassoni. When in 1944 the Oberlin Battle cassone and the Jarves &lt;i&gt;Aeneid&lt;/i&gt; cassone were firmly placed in the workshop of Apollonio di Giovanni, the V. &amp; A. Museum Scipio panel automatically followed. The Oberlin cassone is dated 1463 and it is tempting to place this work in the same period or shortly afterwards.       The Continence of Scipio is rare in 15th century painting and even on cassoni there are only a few examples. Schubring lists two (nos. 302, 541) but these are from different workshops. They are not very similar in composition and neither of them contains the wedding scene.  Condition. Cleaned in 1961. Prov. Bought in 1859 for \\ufffd\\ufffd9 2S. Lit.J. H.

Croce, by Offner (1927) to the Dido Master and by Berenson (1932) to the studio of the Master of Jarves Cassoni, this cassone panel represents the Continence of Scipio, a popular subject at the time. Three similar cassone panels survive: one also attributed to the Workshop of Apollonio di Giovanni in the Art Institute of Chicago, another in collection of the Earl of Harewood, Leeds, and a third one, not by Apollonio, in the Courtauld Institute Galleries, London. This subject from Roman Republican history is mentioned by Plutarch, Livy, and other classical authors, as well as Petrarch and later writers.   Cassoni were usually produced in pair and according to E. Callmann, the usual pendant to the Continence of Scipio would have been a scene of the Rape of the Sabines (two fragments and one panel of this subject attributed to Apollonio\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds workshop survive: in the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh; the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; and the collection the Earl of Harewood, Leeds).   The juxtaposition of these scenes may have been intended to contrast Scipio\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds generosity in returning the captive Lucretia to her prospective husband with Romulus&#39; unscrupulous attack on the Sabines, whom the Romans had previously invited to a banquet. The classical subjects are here portrayed in a contemporary Florentine idiom, reflecting thus the sought-after qualities that &lt;i&gt;The Continence of Scipio&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Rape of the Sabines&lt;/i&gt; exemplify: on one hand the virtues of restraint and magnanimity , and, on the other, a decorous example of feminine submissiveness followed by a wife after her marriage.  The composition is divided into two consecutive scenes: on the left is the representation of the continence of Scipio - identifiable by the inscription SCIPIONE on his hat, and his general\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds baton - who stands in front of Lucretia and her promised husband on the other side of a blanket covered with presents. On the right, is depicted the celebration of Lucretia and Allucius\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd wedding. These two scenes are separated in the middle by a group of soldiers, reminiscent of Paolo Uccello\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds compositions, and a tall buffet known as a &lt;i&gt;credenza&lt;/i&gt;, lavishly decorated with gold plates. These narrative divisions do not affect the fluidity of the composition, which seems superior to the above mentioned version of the &lt;i&gt;Continence of Scipio&lt;/i&gt; in The Art Institute of Chicago (1933.1036).  The identity of the patron who commissioned it is unknown, but his/her coat-of-arms is probably that portrayed on the surcoat of the man at arms on a white horse at centre/left of the scene.</history_note>              <place>Florence</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note>The term &lt;i&gt;cassone&lt;/i&gt; stands in Italian for chest and relates to large and ornate pieces of furniture made in Italy from the 14th to the end of the 16th centuries. They were generally made on the occasion of a relatively important wedding and contained the bride&#39;s trousseau. Writing in the mid-sixteenth century, Vasari describes &lt;i&gt;cassoni&lt;/i&gt; thus:  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcitizens of those times used to have in their apartments great wooden chests in the form of a sarcophagus, with the covers shaped in various fashions\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdand besides the stories that were wrought on the front and on the ends, they used to have the arms, or rather, insignia, of their houses painted on the corners, and sometimes elsewhere. And the stories that were wrought on the front were for the most part fables taken from Ovid and from other poets, or rather stories related by the Greek and Latin historians, and likewise chases, jousts, tales of love, and other similar subjects\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.  (Giorgio Vasari, translated Gaston du C. de Vere, &lt;i&gt;Lives of the Painters, Sculptors and Architects,&lt;/i&gt; vol. 1, London 1996, p.267)  These lavishly decorated &lt;i&gt;cassoni&lt;/i&gt;, often combined with pastiglia decoration, were generally commissioned in pairs. Florence was at that time the main centre of production. The painted decorations usually represented episodes from classical or biblical history or mythology appropriate for the newly wed.   The most flourishing &lt;i&gt;cassone&lt;/i&gt; workshop in Florence was run by Marco del Buono Giamberti and Apollonio di Giovanni but major artists such as Domenico Veneziano and Botticelli may have decorated cassoni on occasion. Painted cassoni went out of fashion towards the end of the 15th century when carved oaken chests came into vogue.</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>PDP</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>313&amp;A-1904</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1899</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Pair of large flat silver hoop earrings (Timsharfin) with a pierced plaque in the centre, Aur\\ufffd\\ufffds (Algeria), 1859-1899.</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>1.65284000</longitude>              <year_start>1859</year_start>              <id>10103</id>              <date_text>1859-1899 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2008BT3353</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description>Pair of large silver hoop earrings.

He moved to Paris before 1629 with his brother Antoine (ca. 1600-26 May 1648) and Mathieu (ca. 1607- 26 April 1677) with whom he had always worked, settling in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\\ufffd\\ufffds. As they worked together, the attribution of their paintings is still problematic. They ran an important studio in Paris and enjoyed a great success as portrait and genres painters.   This painting is a fine example of the Le Nain&#39;s production of austere genre paintings. It shows a family of three people in an outdoor space, before a 17th century lime-kiln. This composition focuses on labour and pleasure, the old man holds a jug of wine, the young boy is playing the flageolet while the woman is showed with a spindle. The Le Nain were responsible for the introduction of genre paintings in France during the first half of the 17th century but their individual manners are almost indistinguishable and far from easy to determine. The attribution of the present painting oscillates therefore between Louis and Matthieu.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography>C.M. Kauffmann, &lt;u&gt;Catalogue of Foreign Paintings, I. Before 1800&lt;/u&gt;, London: 1973, pp. 170-71, cat. no. 209. The following is the full text of the entry:  Louis LE NAIN (1593-1648)  French School  Born at Laon in 1593, Louis was the second of three brothers - the others were Antoine (b. 1588) and Mathieu (b. 1607) - who shared a studio in Paris from about 1630 and painted genre scenes with a realism unusual in French art of the period. All three became members of the Acad\\ufffd\\ufffdmie Royale in 1648, the year of the death of Louis and Antoine. Mathieu, who also painted religious subjects and aristocratic portraits, survived until 1677.  As their work became more decisively disentangled in the 1920S and &#39;30s, Louis emerged as the greatest of the three, indeed, as one of the outstanding artists of the 17th century. In the 17th century he became known as &lt;i&gt;Le Romain&lt;/i&gt;. Whether he actually went to Rome or not, the suggestion that he was influenced by Italian artists, such as Orazio Gentileschi, is convincing. Dutch and Spanish influence has also been detected in his work.  Follower of Louis LE NAIN   209  THE FLAGEOLET PLAYER  Canvas  211 x 191 (55.2 x 50)  Ionides Bequest  CAI.18  Known as Le Nain since it was first recorded in 1815, this painting has proved difficult to place in the oeuvre of any of the three brothers. The tradition that it is by Antoine, supported by Isarlo in 1938, is not convincing, as in many respects it is closer to Louis. Yet in quality it is inferior to the paintings firmly attributed to Louis, as even a brief comparison with CAI.17 can demonstrate. Nor was it entirely convincing to see it grouped with the Metropolitan Museum&#39;s Baker&#39;s Cart and two related paintings (Lansing, 1928-29) later identified as the work of Jean Michelin (1623-96) (Paul Jamot in &lt;i&gt;Revue de L&#39;Art&lt;/i&gt;, lxiii, 1933, pp. 207-18). Unfortunately, apart from Michelin, nothing is known of the work of the Le Nain&#39;s imitators and assistants and until more evidence comes to light it seems most accurate to describe this painting as by a follower of Louis Le Nain.

X-ray photographs have revealed two previous compositions below the present painting, the most important being the complete portrait of a young man, and the other the pentiment of windmill in the upper right sky.   The portrait shows a young man with a soft oval face and almond-shaped heavy lidded eyes comparable to the &lt;i&gt;Portrait of a young man&lt;/i&gt; in the Belgium Museum of Fine Arts, which could be the work of either Mathieu or Louis.   A comparable portrait of a bearded man, wearing a costume with a ruff datable from the 1620s, was revealed by X-radiography under the London National Gallery&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Four figures at a table&lt;/i&gt;. P. Rosenberg in his catalogue raisonn\\ufffd\\ufffd (1993) gives the two London portraits as the only surviving portraits by Mathieu Le Nain. This hidden portrait provides thus further evidence in favour of a Le Nain attribution.  &lt;i&gt;The Flageolet Player&lt;/i&gt; shows an outdoor scene with three figures placed before an architectural element, most likely a 17th-century lime-kiln. This architectural structure compares to a similar feature in &lt;i&gt;Lime Kiln with Figures&lt;/i&gt; by Teniers the Younger, Wellington Museum, Aspley House, WM1583-1948).  Moreover this painting shares with the &lt;i&gt;Peasant Interior&lt;/i&gt; in The National Gallery of Art, Washington such stylistic characteristic as the use of similar figures, an old bearded man, a woman with a spindle and a young boy as well as an awkwardness of scale.    The task of distinguishing the hand of the three brothers remained however far from easy and unsurprisingly P. Rosenberg did suggest any attribution to a particular brother for the present painting. Because of the similarity with the Washington painting attributed to Louis and the presence of an underneath composition most likely by Mathieu, the present painting may well have been executed by either one or the other brother. An old copy of the present composition was recorded in a private collection in Nice in 1971.  The thematic is typical of the output of the Le Nain, who specialised in genre paintings on large scale in the 17th century. Unlike their Netherlandish and Italian predecessors and contemporaries who specialised in small scale genre pictures representing village fairs and tavern scenes, the Le Nain chose to produce austere compositions in a much larger format, emulating somehow history paintings. By doing so, they were ennobling such subject matter and combining a realistic approach in the depiction of everyday details with a fine understanding of the different characters. Particularly notable are the monumentality of the figures and their calm and serene postures. The cool tonality of the painting enhances the monumental aspect through optical effects.   The representation of the individuals also allows reaching some universality through examples of different ages of man: the child, the woman and the older man should be seen as symbols of the unity of different generations.  These paintings however remained far removed from any pastoral tradition in painting or literature and their meaning and purpose remain uncertain. They may be connected with the particular preoccupation of the pious Catholic movement in Paris and of the clergy of St Sulpice, the parish in which the three brothers lived, and where all were buried.  This painting is therefore a fine example of Le Nain&#39;s output of the 1640s but also of the introduction of genre painting in France, of which they were mainly responsible.   &#39;Genre painting&#39; describes scenes of everyday life set in domestic interiors or in the countryside, especially those produced by 17th-century Dutch painters such as Gerard ter Borch, Jan Steen, and Pieter de Hooch. These subjects were not particularly popular with Italian and French artists before the 18th century. Even then, Italian genre painting is mainly restricted to works produced by Northern artists active in Bologna and the Veneto such as Giuseppe Maria Crespi (1665-1747), Giovanni Battista Piazzetta (1682-1754), Pietro Longhi (ca. 1701-1785) and Giacomo Ceruti (1698-1767). In this pre-Enlightment society, issues of social class, the legitimacy of power and the needs of common people were beginning to be discussed in Holland, England and France and the debates were slowly filtering down to Italy. Bolognese intellectual life was particularly active and Crespi, who was corresponding one of the most notable academics, Antonio Muratori (1672-1750), appears to have created a visual response to these debates. The works of the &lt;i&gt;Bamboccianti,&lt;/i&gt; mostly Netherlandish painters specialising in low-life paintings, painted in Rome in the mid 17th century, may also have provided a source for Italian genre painters while the &lt;i&gt;commedia dell&#39;arte&lt;/i&gt; profoundly inspired Crespi and the development of this new Italian version of genre painting. From Bologna the genre spread to Venice thanks to Venetians artists such as Piazzetta and Longhi. They drew the attention of foreign collectors, most notably Joseph Smith the British Consul in Venice, who amassed an impressive collection of such artworks and of Venetian art in general and contributed to the growing taste for these in England. In France, the genre was mainly introduced in the second quarter of the 17th century by the Le Nain brothers, especially Antoine and Louis, whose works still pose problems of individual identification.</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>PDP</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>E.735-2004</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1948</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Wartime propaganda exhibition poster issued by the Ministry of Information.

To this effect, the Ministry staged a series of free exhibitions in central London&#39;s busy Charing Cross public transport station in order to expose Britons to pro-Allied forces propaganda. In this image, a hand [assumed British] symbolically removes Japan&#39;s sphere of influence from Asia Pacific.

The ballet was first performed at London&#39;s Alhambra Theatre, Leicester Square, 12 January 1903, as one item on the bill which included Variety acts and a longer ballet.  From the age of five Edith Slack trained as a dancer with Katti Lanner, and while serving her apprenticeship she danced in Lanner&#39;s ballets at Crystal Palace, the Aquarium and the Empire Theatre. Between 1900 and 1906 she was a leading dancer at the Alhambra, frequently playing so-called &#39;travesty&#39; roles of men played by women.  At a time when no respectable woman showed more than a glimpse of ankle under her long skirts, this theatrical display of female leg was an extra attraction for many gentlemen to patronise ballets at the Alhambra Theatre.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography>&lt;i&gt;Punch, or the London Charivari&lt;/i&gt;, 21 January 1903 AN EVENING FROM HOME.  AT the Alhambra the plot of the new ballet, The Devil&#39;s Forge, will remind veteran opera-goers of Der Freischiitz, and the younger generation of Siegfried. But the scene in the cavern of the mountain witch, where the three army corps of flame, frost and water fairies are manoeuvred with the utmost precision and great kaleidoscopic splendour, owes nothing to WEBER or WAGNER. Miss EDIE SLACK, as that dashing young blade, Karl, excellent in a Romeo costume; Mile. AI.MA MARI, as the Mountain Fairy, gives an excellent imitation of an animated pair of compasses. Music by Mr. GEORGE BYXI;, of the sumptuous and sonorous type. For the rest one can take trips to Fez or the Moon, per Bioscope, or watch the NOLSET Troupe noiset in nature as in name perform their astonishing feat of &#39;Circling the Circ.&#39; Squaring the circle is nothing to the achievement of this amazing quartet of cyclists, who climb into a large skeleton bottomless bucket, so to speak, and then proceed, all four of them, to race, full tilt round the inner sides ot the bucket, which is gradually hoisted up twenty feet into the air.</bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>poster-weiners-ltd</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 17, 2013, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Weiner&#39;s Ltd.</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1903</year_end>              <object_number>O136338</object_number>              <credit>Harry R.

This new rococo style was however symmetrical and so lost much of the exuberance of the 18th century original.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history>Art and Desgn in Europe and America, 1800-1900 (Victoria and Albert Museum 01/01/1987-31/12/2006)</exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>clock-levy-freres</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 17, 2013, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Levy Fr\\ufffd\\ufffdres</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1859</year_end>              <object_number>O124416</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>This clock was bought at the Paris 1855 Exhibition for \\ufffd\\ufffd19 4s 0d.</history_note>              <place>Paris</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>MET</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>2510:1 to 3/(IS)</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1869</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Huqqa of silver and silver inlaid bidri work, with stem entwined with lotus flowers, Hamilton &amp; Co., Calcutta, 1860s.</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>88.37158200</longitude>              <year_start>1860</year_start>              <id>1408</id>              <date_text>1860s (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AU7271</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description>Huqqa with Indian metal design (bidri) work base and stand, with applied silver flowers around base.

Hamilton &amp; Co., which manufactured it in Calcutta, was founded in Edinburgh in 1808 and traded continuously until 30 June 1970. The huqqa, or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhubble bubble\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (smoking pipe), is a fine example of bidri ware, which is made by casting zinc alloyed with small amounts of lead, copper or tin. This forms a base for designs inlaid in silver. The name relates to Bidar, the city in central India most widely associated with the technique, which is unique to India.   The base and stand of this example are inlaid with a silver flower motif and silver mounts. The stem screws into the top of the base and is a hybrid of Indian and high Victorian taste, with naturalistic lotus flowers twining round the central stem. The tobacco bowl and cover are made of separately cast pieces decorated with a lotus pattern in low relief.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history>Arts of Bengal (Whitechapel Art Gallery 30/12/1979-30/09/2011)</exhibition_history>              <bibliography>Swallow, Deborah and John Guy eds. &lt;font u&gt;Arts of India: 1550-1900&lt;/font u&gt;. text by Rosemary Crill, John Guy, Veronica Murphy, Susan Stronge and Deborah Swallow.

Stem, &#39;chilim&#39;, &#39;sarpush&#39; and applied decoration to the stand: silver. 85cm high/ 50cm max. diameter  The firm of Hamilton and Company was working in Calcutta 1815 to 1970, though little is known about their products and scale of manufacture. The firm&#39;s mark is accompanied by a pseudo-assay mark of an elephant to imitate the British assay marks, and another mark (&#39;P&#39; in Bengali script) which may be that of a native workman. The pseudo-assay mark was not intended to mean that the purity of the silver met the standards of English assay offices but rather to suggest quality. The mark appears to belong to the 1860s, which would agree with the old India Museum records which state that this was acquired from the Paris Exhibition of 1867. The catalogue of Indian objects sent to this exhibition is too vague and incomplete to identify individual pieces. Something as flamboyant as this would almost certainly have been made as a showpiece for the exhibition. It is not clear where the &#39;bidri&#39; base and stand were manufactured, the pattern of the inlay not being consistent with known Purnea or Murshidabad pieces, but Purnea did have an export trade in &#39;bidri&#39;. However, the shape of the base is unusual and it may hve been commissioned by Hamilton&#39;s.

His chapel was pulled down and on its site was built a small chapel, the west end of which, probably dating from 1200-1210 remains. The present building was constructed in the early years of the fifteenth century and completed about 1419. Woodwork from St Nicholas, evidently part of the original fitted wooden furnishings, were sold by the churchwardens in 1852 and bought by the Royal Architectural Museum.</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>FWK</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>564:1, 2-1874</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1771</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Vase, silver, made by Parker and Wakelin after a design by Robert Adam, 1770-1771</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>-2.23218000</longitude>              <year_start>1770</year_start>              <id>8392</id>              <date_text>1770-1771 (hallmarked)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AM6767</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description></physical_description>              <dimensions>Height: 22.86 cm, Width: 12.06 cm</dimensions>              <title></title>              <date_start>Jan. 1, 1770</date_start>              <materials_techniques>Silver, with applied cast ornament, embossed and engraved decoration</materials_techniques>              <last_processed>March 2, 2015, 8:38 p.m.</last_processed>              <label></label>              <event_text></event_text>              <production_type></production_type>              <location>British Galleries, room 118d, case 2</location>              <marks>Made in London by John Parker and Edward Wakelin (in partnership from 1758).

Their purpose was purely decorative.  People The form, and some of the ornament, such as the laurel swag and acanthus leaves on the body of this vase, are based on a design by the Italian printmaker Stefano della Bella (1610-1664). He produced about 1,400 prints during his lifetime, which were very influential, particularly a series of designs for vases in Raccolta di Vasi Diversi, published between 1639 and 1648. The design was adapted by the architect Robert Adam (1728-1792), whose drawing, now in Sir John Soane&#39;s Museum in London, was copied by the highly-fashionable silversmithing partnership (active from 1758) of John Parker and Edward Wakelin.  Vase Mania The vase was arguably the most fashionable interior design accessory of the late 18th century, and a distinctive icon of the Neo-classical style. Inspired by the revival of interest in the antique world, the vase was often based, as here, on engraved design sources of a later period. This silver vase was at the top end of the market for such products, along with the ancient urns imported from Italy and the modern ormolu-mounted (gilded) hardstone vases.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>vase-adam-robert</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 14, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Adam, Robert</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1771</year_end>              <object_number>O77666</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>The design for this vase was adapted from an etching in Raccolta di Vasi Diversi by Stefano della Bella, published in Paris, 1646.</history_note>              <place>Great Britain</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>MET</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>905-1871</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1600</date_end>              <descriptive_line></descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>-1.97685000</longitude>              <year_start>1500</year_start>              <id>8761</id>              <date_text>1500-1600 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AM3588</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description></physical_description>              <dimensions>Diameter: 2.2 cm estimated</dimensions>              <title></title>              <date_start>Jan. 1, 1500</date_start>              <materials_techniques>Engraved gold</materials_techniques>              <last_processed>March 2, 2015, 8:39 p.m.</last_processed>              <label>British Galleries: THREE RINGS&lt;br&gt; Rings engraved with declarations of love were called posy rings (from &#39;poesy&#39; meaning poetry). It is frequently not possible to tell which love rings were wedding rings, unless, like two of these rings, they make a direct reference to marriage. Any ring could be a wedding ring, and plain gold bands did not become common until the second half of the 17th century. Interlinking rings are known as gimmel rings (gimmel means twin). They symbolised the joining of two people.

On the outside is an injunction or appeal to &#39;Observe wedloke&#39;.  The message is reinforced on the inside by the reminder in Latin, &#39;remember you must die&#39;, and therefore live virtuously.  Ownership &amp; Use At the beginning of the 16th century the normal practice in the marriage ceremony was for the ring to be placed on the third finger of the bride&#39;s right hand, but the first book of Common Prayer of Edward VI (1549) specifies the third finger of her left hand.  This is probably because a misinterpretation of the ancient author Aulus Gellius (died about 180 AD) had been corrected. It was realised that his description of his belief that a vein flows direct from the third finger to the heart concerns the left hand, and not, as had previously been supposed, the right.  In Roman Catholic Europe in 1614 the Rituale Romanum, an official Catholic book that laid down the services of the church,  followed the change of usage to placing the ring on the left hand. English Catholics (known as &#39;recusants&#39;, because they refused to attend Church of England services), however, followed the old practice until about the middle of the 18th century.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>ring-unknown</slug>              <sys_updated>Feb. 18, 2015, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Unknown</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1600</year_end>              <object_number>O77764</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note></history_note>              <place>England</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>MET</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>CIRC.322-1976</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1907</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Liberty pewter dish</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>-1.90860000</longitude>              <year_start>1898</year_start>              <id>9031</id>              <date_text>ca. 1903 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AM6958</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description></physical_description>              <dimensions>Height: 4 cm, Diameter: 26.2 cm</dimensions>              <title></title>              <date_start>Jan. 1, 1898</date_start>              <materials_techniques>Pewter</materials_techniques>              <last_processed>March 2, 2015, 8:40 p.m.</last_processed>              <label>British Galleries: TUDRIC&#39; PEWTER&lt;br&gt; This ink pot and dish are from Liberty &amp; Co.&#39;s range of less expensive domestic metalwork, called &#39;Tudric&#39;.

Haseler for the Liberty &#39;Tudric&#39; range.  Design &amp; Designing Knox&#39;s designs owe much to the immediate precedents offered by the British Arts and Crafts Movement and the work of C.R. Ashbee and his Guild of Handicraft, in particular. The characteristics shared by the designs produced by Knox and Ashbee include expanses of plain metal, concentrated fluid ornament and monochrome enamel work. Ashbee was to complain later that Liberty&#39;s plagiarised his ideas and principles but in this he was wrong. Liberty metalwork was altogether richer, more assured and self confident than the work of the Guild of Handicraft. Knox and his colleagues,both his fellow designers at the Silver Studio and Liberty management who gave their undoubted support, had moved the Arts and Crafts stylistic principles another stage forward. In so doing, they had created a distinctive British version of Art Nouveau.  Materials &amp; Making Because pewter objects are formed when the metal is in a molten state, cast in moulds, pewter lent itself readily to the sinuous, twisting forms of the Art Nouveau style.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>dish-knox-archibald</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 14, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Knox, Archibald</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1907</year_end>              <object_number>O78047</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>Probably designed by Archibald Knox  (born in Cronkbourne, Tromode, Isle of Man, 1864, died in Douglas, Isle of Man, 1933); made in Birmingham by W.H.

Cut-paper work was a common pastime from the late 17th century, practised by the grandest in the country, from Queen Anne to Queen Victoria, while also being a folk art.  Cut-paper work required time, patience and skill in the use of small scissors, knives and even pins.  Devotional pieces such as this were popular, as were landscapes and flower arrangements.  Materials &amp; Making This example is made up of two pieces of cut-paper work. One is the oval piece of paper out of which the Prayer has been cut, probably using a small knife.  The oval has been ruled in order to guide the artist in the size of the letters.  The artist probably mis-cut the &#39;K&#39; in &#39;Kingdom come&#39;, for a single cut letter &#39;K&#39; has been stuck in from behind.  Once the cutting of the letters was perfect, the oval was glued to the decorative border, which had been cut separately.  People The work has been signed along the bottom in brown ink, &#39;cutt by T Hunter 1786&#39;, who was almost certainly a child.  The cutting of &#39;The Lord&#39;s Prayer&#39; would have been considered an appropriate occupation for a child, concentrating a young mind on a fundamental Christian text.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography>&lt;u&gt;Victoria &amp; Albert Museum Department of Prints and Drawings and Department of Paintings, Accessions 1928. &lt;/u&gt; London: HMSO, 1929 The full text of the entry is as follows:  &#39;&lt;b&gt;HUNTER, T.&lt;/b&gt;  The Lord&#39;s Prayer within a wreath, enclosed in an ornamental  rectangle.   &lt;i&gt; Inscribed in ink on back &lt;/i&gt;cutt by T.

Early Christian altars had minimal adornment. However, 19th-century supporters of the re-introduction of ceremony or ritual into church services adopted the use of a large number of altar furnishings such as candlesticks, crosses, flowers and books. This practice had been common on Roman Catholic altars in the 16th and 17th centuries. Crosses were especially controversial. They were associated with Roman Catholicism in the mid-19th century, and senior Anglican clergy often ordered their removal.  Time Brass church furnishings, a cost-effective way to furnish a church, were especially popular in the 1860s and 1870s. The style of this cross and other metalwork designed by the architect James Brooks (1825-1901) was influential at the time. His designs were less ornate than those of architects such as A.W.N. Pugin (1812-1852) and William Burges (1827-1881) and less concerned with reproducing authentic details of medieval pieces. By the early 20th century, designs similar to those of James Brooks were offered by a number of firms including The Artificer&#39;s Guild.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>altar-cross-brooks-james</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 14, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Brooks, James</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1874</year_end>              <object_number>O78511</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>Designed by James Brooks (born in Hatford, Oxfordshire, 1825, died in London, 1901)</history_note>              <place></place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>MET</collection_code>       </museumobject>    </varesponse> ",
