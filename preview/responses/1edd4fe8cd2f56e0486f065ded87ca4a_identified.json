Stores are classified by type. This data layer was developed to support Denver's Food Retail Expansion to Support Health (FRESH) program. This layer will be stored on the City and County of Denver Spatial Database Engine (SDE) server. The data will be maintained on the SDE by the Office of Economic Development. It will be distributed through to City employees through the SDE and Locate-View-Map, and to the public through Open Data Catalog (and DenverMaps, if desired.) Data will be updated as time/staff permit, as data falls out of date, or through annual/bi-annual scheduled maintenance.Denver FRESH representatives will monitor Denver GIS requirements and submit current FRESH data layers to City SDE as applicable. Published data will comply with the City and County of Denver\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds requirements and Denver Environmental Health\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds GIS Cartographic Standards as described in the data layer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds metadata file. Data sources that originate outside the City must be cited.
