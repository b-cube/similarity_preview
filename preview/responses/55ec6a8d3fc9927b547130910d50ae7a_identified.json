This  comprehensive study is the joint effort of CCFR and EAI to highlight  perceptions of security, use of force, economics, international rules,  and other international issues.  The study seeks to contribute to the  current debate on the United States-South Korea alliance by providing  new data and analyses.  In an attempt to capture and compare American  and South Korean public opinion in the new international setting after  the events of September 11 and the Iraq War, the surveys posed many of  the same questions in both countries on a broad range of international  and bilateral issues.  In particular, this study covers global  perspectives and United States-South Korea security relations. Regarding  global perspectives, respondents were asked to give their opinions on  their country taking an active role in the world, threat perceptions,  the use of force, international institutions, globalization and trade,  and other countries. On the topic of United States-South Korea security  relations, respondents were asked to provide their opinions regarding  bilateral relations and the strategic alliance with the United States,  United States military presence in South Korea, attitudes toward North  Korea, the North Korean nuclear crisis, and reunification with North  Korea. Background information on respondents includes age, gender, occupation, education, income, and ideological inclination.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2004-07-05\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-07-05</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2004-07-16\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-07-16</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2004-07-05\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-07-05</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2004-07-16\" cycle=\"P1\">2004-07-16</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>South Korea</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adult population of South Korea.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A multi-stage quota sampling strategy was employed.
