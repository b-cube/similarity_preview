The module will look at the two interfaces that DSpace 1.5 supports, the XMLUI and the JSPUI detailing what they are, how they differ and the benefits of each. The module will conclude with a look at some example repository interfaces. </description> <dc:date>2008-08-22T08:29:03Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/639\"> <title>The DSpace Course - Metadata Input Customisation</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/639</link> <description>The DSpace Course - Metadata Input Customisation Lewis, Stuart; Yates, Chris This module initially looks at the submission process in further detail, specifically input-forms.xml. It details what the input-forms.xml file is and how it can be used to customize the DSpace submission process. The module will conclude with a practical on a simple modification to the DSpace submission process. This module builds on topics covered in modules 'Repository Structure' and 'Introduction to Items'. It is advised that you have completed these modules before continuing with this module. </description> <dc:date>2008-08-21T15:41:47Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/638\"> <title>The DSpace Course - Repository Structure</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/638</link> <description>The DSpace Course - Repository Structure Lewis, Stuart; Yates, Chris Communities and Collections are used within DSpace to provide the repository with an easily navigable structure often representing an institutions organizational makeup. This module will begin by describing what both a community and collection are and how they relate to each other. The module will then look at example structures that are often used within DSpace repositories, finally concluding with a practical exercise on creating a sample repository structure. This module will make reference to the repository structure, but does not cover aspects such as items or metadata. Further information on items can be found in the module 'An introduction to Items in DSpace'. Further information on metadata can be found in the module 'An introduction to metadata in DSpace'. </description> <dc:date>2008-08-21T15:27:48Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
