In the aftermath of groundings, impacted corals are often broken, dislodged, or flipped over. These fragments are subject to abrasion, scour, and sedimentation, which ultimately result in death. Unchecked, these damages can result in reef loss and instability. However, if dislodged fragments can be collected and stabilized shortly after physical impacts then the probability of survival increases substantially (greater than 90%). Response to physical impacts is a Jurisdictional Priority in both PR/USVI, an identified capacity gap in both jurisdictions, and a priority element of the draft Acropora recovery plan. Puerto Rico and the USVI have acknowledged that because of internal limitations and the need for quick and flexible response that more robust action on the part of NOAA was necessary to help stem the unchecked and unnecessary coral losses that were occurring after physical impacts. In 2009, an emergency response support contract with a local firm was set up. This in combination with the RC's onground presence in the region has enabled NOAA to address the numerous impacts that were occurring annually. The support contract provides NOAA, PR DNER, and USVI DPNR the support that is needed in order to have a functional emergency restoration operation. Since 2009, the RC has performed restoration at 35 sites in PR and the VI where there were physical impacts to coral reefs and have reattached over 15,000 corals. A notification network along with a form to report grounding incidents (Appendix 1) has been set up with the US Coast Guard, salvers, and the local communities so that we are notified immediately of impacts. This notification system has allowed us to often get personnel onsite while the vessel is still aground on the reef. In many of these cases, our team has been able to provide feedback to the salvers to minimize further impacts during vessel extractions, saving countless corals. On multiple occasions we have found that the salvers preferred extraction path would have resulted in significant additional damage and on more than one occasion prevented entire thickets of Acropora spp. from being destroyed.\" </Abstract>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20140711000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/project/490/2014_CRCP_Grounding_Reponse_Report.pdf </URL>  <project>  <ID>490 </ID>  <title>Capacity Building for Coral Grounding Injuries in the Caribbean </title>  <PI>Tom Moore </PI>  </project>  <Region>PR </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-65.248715 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>-67.399870 </Westbc>  <Southbc>17.784130 </Southbc>  <Northbc>18.645740 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>techreport </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>techreport </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
