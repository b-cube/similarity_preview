      <description>&amp;nbsp; Jay, thank you for that kind introduction. &amp;nbsp; Good morning everyone. It is so great to see all of you. I know that many of you have travelled many hours to be here - from California, Oregon, Arkansas, Canada, and Australia. It means a lot to us here at CPSC that you could attend our Summit. &amp;nbsp; Our mission over the next two days needs to be clear. We must work together to come up with ideas and solutions that can save the lives of children and adults on ATVs. &amp;nbsp; This is an important moment for the ATV safety community - one that has been in the works for many years - and this is a moment that must be seized. &amp;nbsp; All of you can appreciate why I am putting this in such stark terms. &amp;nbsp; ATVs are the fourth deadliest product that we oversee at the CPSC. We oversee thousands of products, and ATVs are the fourth deadliest. &amp;nbsp; Let me share another number: 780. That was the number of estimated deaths related to ATV riding across the country in 2009. &amp;nbsp; 780 lives lost. 780 families impacted. &amp;nbsp; When...</description>       <pubDate>Thu, 11 Oct 2012 13:12:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>AHAM Product Safety &amp; Liability Seminar Address, Washington, D.C.</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/AHAM-Product-Safety--Liability-Seminar-Address/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/AHAM-Product-Safety--Liability-Seminar-Address/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Chairman Tenenbaum delivered this speech in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 9, 2012</description>       <pubDate>Tue, 09 Oct 2012 07:30:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Fireworks Safety Press Conference - Tuesday, June 30, 2009, National Mall, Washington, D.C. </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fireworks-Safety-Press-Conference---Tuesday-June-30-2009-National-Mall-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fireworks-Safety-Press-Conference---Tuesday-June-30-2009-National-Mall-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning and welcome to a new day for the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the start of our renewed commitment to protecting the safety of families and children. &amp;nbsp; I am Inez Tenenbaum, the new Chairman of the Commission and I am so pleased to be joined today by our federal law enforcement and homeland security partners. The public should know that the federal government is truly working together to keep illegal fireworks out of the country, to catch those who bring them in, and to make sure consumer fireworks meet U.S. safety rules. &amp;nbsp; The Fourth of July is one of my favorite holidays and its symbolism is demonstrated every year with fireworks here on the National Mall and in communities across the country. &amp;nbsp; This year, CPSC is pleased to report that there has been a decline in fireworks-related deaths and injuries. Our new report (PDF), released today, shows that there were 11 reported fatalities in 2007 and 7 in 2008. There were nearly 10,000 injuries in 2007 and an...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 19:26:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>APEC Conference Keynote Address - Saturday, August 1, 2009, Singapore</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/APEC-Conference-Keynote-Address---Saturday-August-1-2009-Singapore/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/APEC-Conference-Keynote-Address---Saturday-August-1-2009-Singapore/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good Morning. As a representative of the United States Delegation and as the new Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, it is an honor to have been asked to address this APEC Regulator Dialogue on Toy Safety. &amp;nbsp; I am pleased to have been nominated by President Barack Obama to serve as the Chairman of one of the key U.S. safety agencies and a partner agency for most of you here in this room. My life\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work has been centered around the well-being of children \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that continues to be my mission at CPSC, as I will work tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of our youngest consumers, children. Carter, thank you for your kind and generous introduction. CPSC will be working closely with the toy industry and other key stakeholders in our shared pursuit of functional and feasible testing and certification procedures for children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds toys.

Many of you in this room are on the front lines of ensuring that the products consumers use in their kitchen, laundry room, and bedroom are safe and work properly. I want you to know that I respect the work you do and use many of the products you make. &amp;nbsp; But, I am also here today to encourage you to engrain safety into the business practices and culture of your company. As safety managers, engineers and company leaders, you know your products best. I urge you to do everything you can to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbuild safety\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd into product specifications, manufacturing practices, and testing programs. &amp;nbsp; This is a message that I also delivered to product manufacturers and government regulators in Hong Kong, Singapore and Hanoi in August.

Thank you Rachel for that kind introduction. I would like to congratulate you, Rachel, on becoming the President of ICPHSO and commend you for your efforts to advance child safety through your work at CFA. &amp;nbsp; I am so pleased to be here and to be able to participate in ICPHSO\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds first ever meeting in Canada and its 6th international meeting and training symposium. I also would like to recognize the sponsor of the conference, CSA and the co-host of the conference, Health Canada. Health Canada has been one of CPSC\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds closest allies in product safety enforcement. Not only do we have monthly coordination conference calls, but we are also partnering with Health Canada on joint recall announcements. Over the last year, more than a dozen recalls have been announced jointly, drawing significant media attention in the United States and here in Canada. &amp;nbsp; Sandra Wright and Rob Ianiro are here today from Health Canada.

Unfortunately, developments in Washington required me to make the extremely difficult decision to stay behind rather than accompany our U.S. delegation to the Toy Safety Dialogue. I genuinely regret having to miss this important meeting and I hope that you will accept a recording of my remarks as a way for me to demonstrate my continued commitment to the work of the APEC Toy Safety Initiative. &amp;nbsp; Before continuing, please allow me to acknowledge those who worked so hard to make this event possible from both the private sector, under TIA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds sponsorship, and within governments. I would like to thank especially Ms. Jamie Ferman, the Project Overseer, whose tireless efforts ensured a great meeting in Singapore, last year, and made possible our gathering here today. &amp;nbsp; As Chairman of CPSC -- one...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 19:16:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>TIA International Toy Fair - Monday, February 15, 2010, New York </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/TIA-International-Toy-Fair---Monday-February-15-2010-New-York-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/TIA-International-Toy-Fair---Monday-February-15-2010-New-York-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen. &amp;nbsp; It is an honor for me to address TIA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds American International Toy Fair this morning. &amp;nbsp; Thank you, Carter Keithley and all of those who worked so hard to make this event possible. I would also like to thank Carter and TIA for its support of the APEC Toy Safety Dialogue held in Hong Kong this January. That was a very important event because our engagement with APEC economies, particularly China, will have a direct effect on the quality and safety of children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds toys here in the United States. &amp;nbsp; We know that engagement works with good business people because, right here in the United States, the cooperation that CPSC has seen from manufacturers, importers and retailers has had a dramatic effect on toy safety. &amp;nbsp; Over the last two years, the toy industry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds record on safety has improved dramatically. In 2008, there were 162 toy recalls; in 2009, toy recalls dropped to just 41. Recalls involving lead in toys dropped from 85 in 2008 to just 14 last year. ...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 19:15:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>ICPHSO Keynote Address - Wednesday, February 17, 2010, Washington, D.C.</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/ICPHSO-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-February-17-2010-Washington-DC/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/ICPHSO-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-February-17-2010-Washington-DC/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Watch the video of this speech.

I appreciate your leadership and the significant efforts made by your association to keep your members engaged in relevant safety issues. &amp;nbsp; In preparing my remarks, I was told that there would be CEOs and senior managers in the audience who are curious about what it was like taking over a government agency in a time when \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdChange\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd was promised to the American people. Well, let\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds take a quick look at where CPSC was: &amp;nbsp; First of all, in recent years the agency\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds staffing and budget were half of what they were 30 years ago. At one time the agency had 900 employees and that number had dropped to 385. &amp;nbsp; Businesses shifted manufacturing overseas, the majority of recalls ended up coming from China, and the way CPSC conducts its business was forever changed. &amp;nbsp; Maintenance of our 1950\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds-era testing lab was becoming a bigger and bigger concern. &amp;nbsp; Technology...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 19:09:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>DRI Keynote Address - Wednesday, April 7, 2010, Las Vegas, NV </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/DRI-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-April-7-2010-Las-Vegas-NV-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/DRI-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-April-7-2010-Las-Vegas-NV-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Thank you so much John [Kuppens] for your gracious introduction.

Commissioner, I am delighted to join you today in signing this historic information-sharing agreement with U.S. Customs and Border Protection. &amp;nbsp; We are honored to join forces with CBP, which this summer will be celebrating its 221st anniversary of its work in \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsecuring and facilitating trade and travel while enforcing hundreds of U.S. laws\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, including the safety regulations of my agency the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

You are a selfless advocate for the well being of children and your support for CPSC with additional funds and authorities have meant so much to our agency. Your constituents are fortunate to have you as their representative in Congress. &amp;nbsp; We are all here today for a simple but powerful reason: to save the lives of children in Florida and across the country this summer. &amp;nbsp; With Memorial Day Weekend fast approaching, the majority of pools and spas in this country will soon be open. And CPSC has new and troubling data to share. Our data is showing an average of 385 drowning deaths and 4,200 submersion injuries each year involving children younger than 15. &amp;nbsp; As you might imagine, the majority of these pool and spa incidents involve children under 5. &amp;nbsp; But contrary to what some may believe, pool and spa drownings do not involve a lot of splashing or yelling.

My path from practicing environmental law in a large law firm, to being elected the State Superintendent of Education for South Carolina, to being appointed the Chairman of the CPSC allows me to continue my passion of promoting children's safety and well-being and has expanded that passion to ensuring the safety and well-being of all American consumers.

Minister Jimenez and Director General Andreu thank you for the invitation to visit your country and join this distinguished gathering of product safety advocates. It is a pleasure to be here at today's meeting on this beautiful island of Mallorca. &amp;nbsp; As a lifelong advocate for the well being of children, I was honored to have been asked by President Obama to lead this vital agency. We at CPSC are driven by our meaningful mission - a mission that is in line with what everyone here today is working to accomplish. &amp;nbsp; Success for all of us is measured in lives saved and injuries prevented from dangerous products. Though, success for all of us can only be achieved if our vision stretches beyond the United States and beyond Europe. &amp;nbsp; Former Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan once stated, \"We must ensure that the global market is embedded in broadly shared values and practices that reflect global social needs, and that all the world's people share the benefits o...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 19:03:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Fireworks Safety Press Conference - Tuesday, June 29, 2010 </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fireworks-Safety-Press-Conference---Tuesday-June-29-2010-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fireworks-Safety-Press-Conference---Tuesday-June-29-2010-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning and welcome to our annual tradition of coming together here on the National Mall to talk about fireworks safety before we all celebrate the Fourth of July. &amp;nbsp; I am Inez Tenenbaum, Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This is my second year of hosting this exciting press event, and I am so pleased to be joined once again by our federal law enforcement and homeland security partners. &amp;nbsp; We are also joined this year by a special guest who has a powerful story to tell - a story that everyone who plans to purchase and use fireworks must hear. &amp;nbsp; The numbers speak to the importance of our event today. Consumers should know that there are about 200 injuries each day involving fireworks during the month surrounding the holiday - 200 injuries each day. And as we will hear from Jason, many of these injuries can be life altering. &amp;nbsp; Our newest data report indicates a drop in fireworks related fatalities.

Chief Shuman, thank you for your kind introduction and for the opportunity to be among the leaders of the fire safety community in the United States. &amp;nbsp; The Chief and I met earlier this year, and I was so impressed with the policy, advocacy and education work being done by your Association on safe energy, sprinklers, and green buildings. &amp;nbsp; As the Chief mentioned, prior to taking the Chairmanship at the Consumer Product Safety Commission much of my life in public service took place in South Carolina - in the state legislature and running the state department of education. I truly valued during those years my relationships with the state fire marshal and with local fire departments. We partnered across the state on education programs aimed at instilling fire safe practices into children early in their lives. &amp;nbsp; As all of you know so well, the bravery shown by the men and women who serve on the frontline in firefighting and fire investigation is beyond compare.

It is so good to be here in Chicago with you, Linda and Boaz. Your organization, Kids In Danger, is a leading source for child safety information and a leading force in the development of child safety standards. &amp;nbsp; It is also an honor to join forces today with one of the top Attorneys General in the country. Lisa Madigan uses this state's strong consumer protection laws to keep children safe and to hold companies accountable if they put the safety of children at risk. &amp;nbsp; As enforcers, the Attorney General and I share a similar approach and I'm so pleased that our agencies are finding new ways to collaborate. &amp;nbsp; I also want to thank my colleague Rachel Weintraub of the Consumer Federation of America for participating in today's event. Some of the best provisions in the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 are in there because of the hard work of Rachel. &amp;nbsp; Linda and Boaz, we are all joining with you today to honor Danny - we are...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:58:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>PoolSafely Kids Education Press Event - Friday, July 23, 2010, Houston, Texas </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/PoolSafely-Kids-Education-Press-Event---Friday-July-23-2010-Houston-Texas-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/PoolSafely-Kids-Education-Press-Event---Friday-July-23-2010-Houston-Texas-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Judge Emmett, thank you very much for that warm introduction and for your leadership in keeping the four million residents of Harris County safe and secure. &amp;nbsp; We are all here today for a simple but powerful reason: to save the lives of children in Houston and across Texas. &amp;nbsp; Drowning is a leading - but preventable - cause of death and injury among children under the age of five. We're so pleased to be here at the Weekley Family Y to do something about that tragic statistic. &amp;nbsp; Our new Pool Safely public education campaign is all about using and sharing the simple steps that can save a child's life. &amp;nbsp; Just last month a teacher heroically saved the life of a two year old boy in Southwest Houston through his quick actions and knowledge of CPR. &amp;nbsp; Texas is considered a trouble spot when it comes to pool safety as there are a high number of drowning and submersion incidents year round - there have been 17 incidents in Texas just since Memorial Day. &amp;nbsp; CPSC, along with the National Drowning...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:56:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Diversity Day Celebration - Tuesday, August 10, 2010, Washington, D.C. </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Diversity-Day-Celebration---Tuesday-August-10-2010-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Diversity-Day-Celebration---Tuesday-August-10-2010-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone.

Let's all give a round of applause to Kathy and the diversity day team that put this event together. &amp;nbsp; Great job! &amp;nbsp; The cultural and ethnic diversity of our agency is one of our greatest strengths. Since our work touches the lives of every family, it is imperative that CPSC be representative of those who we work to protect. I believe that we are. &amp;nbsp; With roots in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, the Cherokee Nation, Brazil, France, and all across our great country, there is remarkable diversity within our workforce. &amp;nbsp; With belief ranging from Christianity to Judaism, Catholicism to Islam, there is true diversity within our team. &amp;nbsp; Dr. Maya Angelou, who recently spoke at the National Urban League's 100th Anniversary Conference, once stated: \"We all should know that diversity makes for a rich tapestry, and we must understand that all the threads of the tapestry are equal in value no matter what their color.\" &amp;nbsp; Every one of you has...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:55:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Consumer Specialty Products Association Conference Keynote Address - Thursday, September 23, 2010, Bethesda, MD </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Consumer-Specialty-Products-Association-Conference-Keynote-Address---Thursday-September-23-2010-Bethesda-MD-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Consumer-Specialty-Products-Association-Conference-Keynote-Address---Thursday-September-23-2010-Bethesda-MD-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone. Adam Selisker, thank you very much for that kind introduction. I would like to recognize the leadership that Adam has demonstrated as the chairman of your association and as a first responder in his community. &amp;nbsp; As a long-time fire chief in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Adam has rescued countless individuals in times of peril \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd from burning homes and car crashes, to a neighbor experiencing health problems. &amp;nbsp; With Adam being a fire chief and Chris Cathcart volunteering his time and expertise as a pilot on Angel Flights, the association demonstrates its personal commitment to public service. &amp;nbsp; At CPSC, we have had a very good year. It has been a year of rebuilding and strengthening our connection with consumers. &amp;nbsp; We have increased our staffing level to its highest point in the last 21 years. We opened our first foreign office in Beijing, and we added more staff and technologies to our import surveillance program. &amp;nbsp; As we look to the future, I am pleased to share...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:53:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Pool Safely Day Press Event Remarks - Monday, September 27, 2010, Great River Water Park, St. Paul, Minn</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Pool-Safely-Day-Press-Event-Remarks---Monday-September-27-2010-Great-River-Water-Park-St-Paul-Minn/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Pool-Safely-Day-Press-Event-Remarks---Monday-September-27-2010-Great-River-Water-Park-St-Paul-Minn/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Mayor Coleman, thank you very much for that warm introduction and for this beautiful proclamation. Mayor, it is an honor to be in St. Paul and I commend you for your leadership and advocacy for the safety of your residents and visitors. &amp;nbsp; I am so pleased to launch Pool Safely Day in St. Paul. This is a nationwide effort today with more than 30 events in 12 states and the District of Columbia. &amp;nbsp; Our message from St. Paul to San Diego, from Minnesota to Montana, is a simple one: swimming occurs all year round in water parks, hotels, motels, and warm weather states; therefore, we need to protect children in and around the water all year round. &amp;nbsp; Communities from coast to coast are making drowning and drain entrapment prevention a priority today, but the Consumer Product Safety Commission made this event the heart of Pool Safely Day for two powerful reasons: to honor Abigail Taylor and to save the lives of children across Minnesota. &amp;nbsp; Katey and Scott [Taylor], your strength in the face ...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:52:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Interagency Import Safety Conference Keynote Remarks - Thursday October 21, 2010, Washington Dulles Marriot, Dulles, Va. </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Interagency-Import-Safety-Conference-Keynote-Remarks---Thursday-October-21-2010-Washington-Dulles-Marriot-Dulles-Va-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Interagency-Import-Safety-Conference-Keynote-Remarks---Thursday-October-21-2010-Washington-Dulles-Marriot-Dulles-Va-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning.

This conference has the potential to unify the federal government around a common pursuit in which the public wants us to be engaged. &amp;nbsp; If we can work collectively to keep dangerous, substandard, and violative goods out the hands of consumers, then I believe we can restore the public's confidence in government and their belief that government works for the people. &amp;nbsp; I am honored to be here today with the leaders of so many great agencies, and I am optimistic about what we can achieve today. My optimism is based upon the positive change that we have...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:50:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Safe Sleep Press Event - Friday October 22, 2010, NY-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, N.Y. </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Safe-Sleep-Press-Event---Friday-October-22-2010-NY-Presbyterian-Hospital-New-York-NY--/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Safe-Sleep-Press-Event---Friday-October-22-2010-NY-Presbyterian-Hospital-New-York-NY--/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Dr. Pardes, thank you so much for that kind introduction. Good morning everyone. We are here in one of the best hospitals in New York City for such an important reason: to save the lives of babies in New York and all across the country. &amp;nbsp; Ensuring a safe sleep for babies and toddlers is one of my top priorities as Chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. We know that the safest place for an infant to sleep is alone in a crib, bassinet or play yard. &amp;nbsp; I firmly believe that all parents should have confidence in the safety of the cribs, bassinets or play yards they purchase. And they should have confidence that when they put their child to sleep, their child will be safe. &amp;nbsp; Now, parents and caregivers play a role in safe sleep. As you will hear from many of the distinguished speakers today, babies should be placed to sleep on their back in a crib. Pillows, quilts, thick blankets and sleep positioners should never be put in a crib. &amp;nbsp; CPSC plays a vital role in ensuring that...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:49:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Fudan University - Center for American Studies - International Cooperation On Product Safety - Wednesday October 27, 2010, Shanghai, China </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fudan-University---Center-for-American-Studies---International-Cooperation-On-Product-Safety---Wednesday-October-27-2010-Shanghai-China-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fudan-University---Center-for-American-Studies---International-Cooperation-On-Product-Safety---Wednesday-October-27-2010-Shanghai-China-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good afternoon. Thank you Dr. Shen for that kind introduction. I would also like to thank our hosts, Minister Zhi Shuping and his colleagues at AQSIQ and in the Shanghai government for their hospitality during our visit to Shanghai. &amp;nbsp; INTRODUCTION &amp;nbsp; This week, I was pleased to participate in Second Trilateral U.S. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd E-U \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd China Consumer Product Safety Summit here in Shanghai. And today, I am especially pleased to be able to address the Fudan University community about International Cooperation On Product Safety. &amp;nbsp; I am happy to report that International Cooperation has come a long way for both of our countries. In the long history of China, this new level of international cooperation that we are beginning to see, speaks well for China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds determination to be a leader on global business issues. &amp;nbsp; It has been 31 years since our countries re-established diplomatic relations. Our U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has been in existence for only 38 years. &amp;nbsp; And after all this time, an...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:47:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Opening Remarks, WCMA Stakeholders Meeting - Tuesday November 9, 2010, Bethesda, MD </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Opening-Remarks-WCMA-Stakeholders-Meeting---Tuesday-November-9-2010-Bethesda-MD-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Opening-Remarks-WCMA-Stakeholders-Meeting---Tuesday-November-9-2010-Bethesda-MD-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>To members of the Window Covering Manufacturers Association, window covering retailers, consumer advocates, and representatives of Health Canada and the European Union, good morning and welcome to CPSC headquarters. &amp;nbsp; Ralph, thank you for providing me with a few minutes to speak at this important stakeholder's meeting. &amp;nbsp; I know that time has been dedicated already this morning to discussing processes and procedures. In a moment, I will share my expectations for the revision to the ANSI standard, but we must recognize our motivation for being here today: &amp;nbsp; A young child is likely to die this month in a window cord incident. &amp;nbsp; And a young child is likely to die every month that this standard is being worked on. &amp;nbsp; With all my heart, I hope that this doesn't come true, but it is what our statistics predict. &amp;nbsp; One month it may be a toddler who wanders over to a roll up blind and wraps the exposed cord around his neck. &amp;nbsp; Another month it may be a baby in a crib that is positioned too clos...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:46:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>National School Safety Coalition Press Event - Monday December 13, 2010, National Press Club, Washington, DC </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/National-School-Safety-Coalition-Press-Event---Monday-December-13-2010-National-Press-Club-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/National-School-Safety-Coalition-Press-Event---Monday-December-13-2010-National-Press-Club-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good afternoon everyone. Jim [Guest], thank you so much for the kind introduction and for the support that Consumers Union has provided to CPSC throughout this year. We greatly appreciate it. &amp;nbsp; The Consumer Product Safety Commission is proud to stand today with the FTC, PTA, National School Boards Association and Dutchess County to demonstrate our support for Consumers Union and the National School Safety Coalition. &amp;nbsp; This is a strong coalition, made up of agencies and organizations that share a common vision and dedication to the safety and well being of our nation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds children. &amp;nbsp; Last year, I travelled to New York to visit Jim and the employees who test products for Consumers Union.

Andrew [Klein], thank you so much for the kind introduction, and thank you Victoria [Espinel] for the invitation to speak at this important forum. &amp;nbsp; For those of you who may be unfamiliar with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, we are an independent agency that prevents deaths and serious injuries in and around the home by regulating the safety of thousands of consumer products. &amp;nbsp; Occasionally, those products are found to be counterfeit. &amp;nbsp; Now, you may know of CPSC through the recalls that we announce on the news, but we also set performance standards, detain dangerous goods at ports of entry, conduct inspections in the marketplace, and work with foreign regulators to promote best manufacturing practices and compliance with U.S. safety laws. &amp;nbsp; We are a stronger agency today, better equipped to protect the safety of all consumers, including children, than in years past. We are also more focused on injury prevention and tackling emerging hazards than in the...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:43:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>American Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong Address - Wednesday, January 12, 2011, Hong Kong </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/American-Chamber-of-Commerce-of-Hong-Kong-Address---Wednesday-January-12-2011-Hong-Kong-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/American-Chamber-of-Commerce-of-Hong-Kong-Address---Wednesday-January-12-2011-Hong-Kong-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning and happy New Year to everyone and thank you for that kind introduction. It is great to be back in Hong Kong and to have the opportunity to spend time with members of the chamber. &amp;nbsp; With 40 years of experience promoting trade in Hong Kong, China, and the United States, your organization is a driving force for economic growth in the region. &amp;nbsp; Even as we progress out of our deep recession, the United States remains a leading consumer of goods manufactured in this region. &amp;nbsp; During my time as Chairman, there has been little, if any, measureable decline in the demand for consumer products from this region or in the number of imports coming in to the United Sates from this region. &amp;nbsp; My agency recognizes that Chinese trade through Hong Kong and Hong Kong\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds investments in the production of goods made in mainland China account for a significant percentage of exports to the U.S. &amp;nbsp; Other exporters in the region are also becoming more significant. &amp;nbsp; This is why I and other official...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:41:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Hong Kong Toy &amp; Games Fair Keynote Address - Wednesday, January 12, 2011, Hong Kong </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Hong-Kong-Toy--Games-Fair-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-January-12-2011-Hong-Kong-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Hong-Kong-Toy--Games-Fair-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-January-12-2011-Hong-Kong-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning and happy new year to everyone. &amp;nbsp; Mr. Shing, thank you for that kind introduction. It is great to be back in Hong Kong at the largest toy fair in Asia. &amp;nbsp; Being here in Hong Kong to start the new year says a lot about where the Consumer Product Safety Commission\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds focus and attention will be in 2011. &amp;nbsp; We are coming off of a very good year at CPSC. Toy safety was both a top priority and a success story in 2010 and it will continue to be a priority in 2011. Working directly with our stakeholders in Asia was a priority last year, and as my presence here today shows, it will continue this year. &amp;nbsp; Another priority is for CPSC to be more proactive in anticipating product safety issues, which is a key part of our new strategic plan. I talk about our strategic plan later in my remarks. &amp;nbsp; Now the new designs and trends seen at the fair this week are likely to influence which toys children are asking for and playing with in 2011. This is because the designs seen at the fair will...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:39:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>International Consumer Product Health and Safety Organization Conference Keynote Address - Thursday, February 24, 2011, Orlando, Florida </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/International-Consumer-Product-Health-and-Safety-Organization-Conference-Keynote-Address---Thursday-February-24-2011-Orlando-Florida-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/International-Consumer-Product-Health-and-Safety-Organization-Conference-Keynote-Address---Thursday-February-24-2011-Orlando-Florida-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good afternoon everyone.

Last year I came before all of you and spelled out an ambitious agenda for the agency in 2010. Today I am pleased to tell you about the promises that we kept last year as well as the vision we have for stepping up product safety in the year ahead. &amp;nbsp; As the President said in his State of the Union address, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwe do big things.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd This certainly applies to our great country, and it also applies to our approach at CPSC to keeping families safe. &amp;nbsp; ...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:37:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>OAS/PAHO Consumer Protection Event Speech - Monday, February 28, 2011, Washington, DC </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/OASPAHO-Consumer-Protection-Event-Speech---Monday-February-28-2011-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/OASPAHO-Consumer-Protection-Event-Speech---Monday-February-28-2011-Washington-DC-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone. &amp;nbsp; To Secretary General Insulza, Director Oliveira, Mr. Linders, Assistant Director Gross-Galiano, and participants in this post-graduate course, welcome to Washington, D.C. &amp;nbsp; To those who are participating in this training program online, thank you for joining us.

It is good to be back at this conference. &amp;nbsp; I believe that CPSC's accomplishments over the past year have made many homes and many nurseries safer for young children. &amp;nbsp; A lot of the progress that has been made in the juvenile product world involved CPSC working cooperatively with your industry on standards changes and corrective actions in the marketplace. &amp;nbsp; Many of these actions are tied to four key elements to creating a Safe Sleep environment for babies. I talked about these four points in my remarks last year. &amp;nbsp; First, we recalled many of the remaining dangerous cribs that needed to be fixed or removed from homes. Last year, 14 manufacturers stepped up and participated in voluntary recalls to provide consumers with repairs, credits or reimbursements to address the hazard associated with drop-side cribs. &amp;nbsp; Next, we established and continue to work on ne...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:34:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>National Drowning Prevention Symposium - Tuesday, March 15, 2011, Colorado Springs, Colorado </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/National-Drowning-Prevention-Symposium---Tuesday-March-15-2011-Colorado-Springs-Colorado-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/National-Drowning-Prevention-Symposium---Tuesday-March-15-2011-Colorado-Springs-Colorado-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone. &amp;nbsp; Bob, thank you very much for that kind introduction and for your leadership at the National Drowning Prevention Alliance. CPSC has long considered NDPA to be one of the premiere water safety organizations in the country. &amp;nbsp; The gathering of attendees for this symposium affirms the respect that we all have for the NDPA and its mission. &amp;nbsp; You, the members of the NDPA, are today's leaders in preventing child drownings. You are the innovators and experts in creating effective layers of protection. You are the educators and public health officials who effect changes in pool codes and parental behavior. &amp;nbsp; It is for these reasons that I am so pleased to be here with you today. I am joined by a number of CPSC staff, including Pool Safely campaign leader Kathleen Reilly and founding board member Marcia Kerr, along with our friends from Widmeyer Communications. &amp;nbsp; We are all here today for a simple but powerful reason: to save the lives of children across the country.

Today is a good day for our country; yet, we must never forget the victims of the attack on our country on 9-11. &amp;nbsp; It is has been a year and a half since I last spoke before the membership of AHAM. As I stated back in 2009, I respect the work that you do, and I recognize how the products that you make are integral to the lives of consumers. &amp;nbsp; Many of you in this room are on the front lines of ensuring that the products consumers use in their kitchen, laundry room, and bedroom are safe and work properly. &amp;nbsp; Wayne [Morris], I appreciated your comments before the House Energy and Commerce...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 18:31:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Memorial Day Weekend Pool Safely Press Event - Thursday, May 26, 2011, Parkway Family Aquatics Center, Chula Vista, Calif.</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Memorial-Day-Weekend-Pool-Safely-Press-Event---Thursday-May-26-2011-Parkway-Family-Aquatics-Center-Chula-Vista-Calif/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Memorial-Day-Weekend-Pool-Safely-Press-Event---Thursday-May-26-2011-Parkway-Family-Aquatics-Center-Chula-Vista-Calif/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Mayor Cox, thank you very much for that warm introduction.

Good morning everyone. It is wonderful to see so many familiar faces here today. &amp;nbsp; First, I want to commend AAFA on hosting its seventh Product Safety and Sustainability Seminar &amp;amp; Exhibition. Just a few months ago I spoke to AAFA's Product Safety Council. &amp;nbsp; As I expressed to the members of the Product Safety Council, it is my hope that AAFA and its members will use these types of events to carry out what I believe is a fundamental building block of a \"preventative\" product safety strategy - education. &amp;nbsp; As we continue to implement our most recently passed regulations, we will continue to rely on trade associations like AAFA - we will rely on you to be our partner in educating and answering questions of industry members. &amp;nbsp; We want to work with you to answer questions about how to comply with our safety requirements and always deliver a safe product to consumers. &amp;nbsp; During my time with you today, I would like to focus on two main areas:...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 17:38:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>American International Toy Fair Keynote Address - Tuesday, February 14, 2012, New York, N.Y. </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/American-International-Toy-Fair-Keynote-Address---Tuesday-February-14-2012-New-York-NY-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/American-International-Toy-Fair-Keynote-Address---Tuesday-February-14-2012-New-York-NY-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone. It is great to be back at the American International Toy Fair. I was here in 2010 and was amazed by the size of the fair, and it looks like Toy Fair 2012 is even bigger! &amp;nbsp; With nearly 100,000 products on display and attendees from nearly 100 countries, this is the place to be. &amp;nbsp; As part of our commitment to outreach and education, CPSC staff and I plan to walk the showroom floor and meet with as many of you as we can. &amp;nbsp; We take pride in being accessible at CPSC. We want to get to know you and your company, and we want to support you in complying with all of the U.S. toy requirements. &amp;nbsp; Carter, I also want to thank you and the TIA for the opportunity to keynote the toy safety compliance session. &amp;nbsp; When I was here in 2010, I spoke about the responsibility of product safety regulators to ensure that all toy hazards - including small parts, toxic metals, and dangerous magnets - are addressed by manufacturers. &amp;nbsp; During the past two years, I believe CPSC has continu...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 17:33:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>American Pyrotechnics Association Education &amp; Leadership Conference Keynote Address - Wednesday, February 22, 2012, Las Vegas, Nevada </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/American-Pyrotechnics-Association-Education--Leadership-Conference-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-February-22-2012-Las-Vegas-Nevada-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/American-Pyrotechnics-Association-Education--Leadership-Conference-Keynote-Address---Wednesday-February-22-2012-Las-Vegas-Nevada-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone.

Michelle, for the second straight year, I want to thank you for that kind introduction. &amp;nbsp; This outstanding organization is well served by having you on their Board, and CPSC is well served by having your support in the Wisconsin Department of Consumer Protection. &amp;nbsp; So let's give Michelle a round of applause for all of her efforts to improve the health and safety of consumers. &amp;nbsp; This is my sixth ICPHSO conference. &amp;nbsp; Six conferences in less than three years. &amp;nbsp; I'm doing all I can to keep pace with Marc and Carol and Ross. Also, I want to recognize my colleague, Commissioner Bob Adler, who has attended this conference in Orlando for the past three years. &amp;nbsp; I have supported ICPHSO throughout my tenure because I believe this is a great forum for CPSC - a great forum for us to engage in a forward-looking conversation with all of our stakeholders. &amp;nbsp; And with today being CPSC Day, I am especially proud to be here.

Joe, thank you for that kind introduction. Joe, I believe that companies like yours play an important role in implementing recall programs in a way that helps both the consumer and the recalling firm. &amp;nbsp; You can always count on Stericycle to be at the key safety conferences like this Summit and ICPHSO, so keep up the good work. &amp;nbsp; I hope you all got a chance to listen to Andy Kameros's presentation this morning, as he has been working very hard to make the Office of Compliance accessible to the regulated community and promote fairness in our regulatory activities. &amp;nbsp; I also want to recognize Anu Connor, who is here today. Anu joined my office just last week as my Special Assistant and Legal Counsel. &amp;nbsp; To the members of the JPMA, I want to share with you that I feel like we have established a tradition. This is now my third JPMA Summit, and it is good to see many familiar faces here today. &amp;nbsp; About three months after my appearance here last year, we hit a milesto...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 17:16:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Womenetics POW Awards, Keynote Address - Tuesday, April 17, 2012, Atlanta, Georgia </title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Womenetics-POW-Awards-Keynote-Address---Tuesday-April-17-2012-Atlanta-Georgia-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Womenetics-POW-Awards-Keynote-Address---Tuesday-April-17-2012-Atlanta-Georgia-/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>It is my great pleasure to be in Atlanta today to help Womenetics celebrate the POW awards. &amp;nbsp; Elisabeth [Marchant], it seems like it was yesterday when you and I were sitting in my living room and you were describing the vision for Womenetics\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlook at it now.

A picture of his smiling face sits in my office, which I look at almost every day. &amp;nbsp; It has been a long and difficult journey, but after 14 years of advocacy by you and your husband, I am proud to stand with you to announce that a new, mandatory play yard standard was approved today by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. &amp;nbsp; This is a moment when we can truly honor Danny. We are honoring Danny by making it the law of the land that all importers, manufacturers and distributors of play yards must comply with a strict federal standard\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda standard that will prevent the deadly side rail collapse that took Danny\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds life and the lives of nearly 20 others. &amp;nbsp; This law will go into effect in December and will give parents and caregivers such peace of mind when they are placing their babies to sleep in a safe new play yard. &amp;nbsp; Having a tougher play yard rule in place is so important.

There have been 15 reports of the heating element in the dishwashers failing, causing seven fires, three of which led to extensive property damage. &amp;nbsp; Fortunately, there have been no injuries, but we need consumers to respond to this recall right away. &amp;nbsp; The recall involves well known models like the GE Profile, Hotpoint, and other models that were sold between March 2006 and April 2009. &amp;nbsp; My message to consumers ...</description>       <pubDate>Mon, 17 Sep 2012 16:49:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Fireworks Safety Press Conference: Chairman Inez Tenenbaum\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Remarks</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fireworks-Safety-Press-Conference-Chairman-Inez-Tenenbaums-Remarks/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Fireworks-Safety-Press-Conference-Chairman-Inez-Tenenbaums-Remarks/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Tuesday, June 30, 2009, National Mall, Washington, D.C. &amp;nbsp; </description>       <pubDate>Thu, 06 Sep 2012 09:52:00 GMT</pubDate>     </item>     <item>       <title>Chairman Inez Tenenbaum U.S.-China Consumer Product Safety Summit, Closing Remarks State Department</title>       <link>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Chairman-Inez-Tenenbaum-US-China-Consumer-Product-Safety-Summit-Closing-Remarks-State-Department/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</link>       <guid>http://www.cpsc.gov/en/About-CPSC/Chairman/Speeches/Chairman-Inez-Tenenbaum-US-China-Consumer-Product-Safety-Summit-Closing-Remarks-State-Department/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=Chairman%27s+Speeches</guid>       <description>Good morning everyone. I am so pleased to be able to state that the Fourth U.S.-China Consumer Product Safety Summit between CPSC and AQSIQ has been our best summit. Vice Minister Sun and Director General Wang, I want to thank you for your leadership at this summit and for your leadership in advancing the cause of product safety in China. This summit demonstrated your commitment to strengthening our relationship, to improving bilateral and multilateral communication and participation, and to striving for higher levels of quality and safety in the manufacturing of consumer products. I mention quality because the results of an interesting survey were recently released. A brand management company called The Monogram Group recently surveyed consumers and found a 50 percent increase since 2008 in Americans who believe goods made in China are of a high quality. And there was a 14 percent drop in the percentage of Americans who believe Chinese goods are of low quality.
