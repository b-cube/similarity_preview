ICSU ROAP and its partners the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) and the Science Council of Japan is holding a pre-scoping workshop to discuss a collaboration mechanism to share knowledge and expertise for better wellbeing in the region of the marginal seas of East Asia.\\ufffd\\ufffd<span>The marginal seas of East Asia lie along the Western Pacific rim, and have islands that spread from the Bering Sea in the North, to the Indonesian seas in the South. It is a very important region especially in relation to international commerce and global security, and links several heavily populated coastal megacities that have active societal, economic and industrial significance. This marginal seas is also a region of the highest marine biodiversity in the world, and its coral reefs and waters around atolls and small islands serve as the spawning grounds and nurseries of many marine species including tuna and other pelagic species that serve as very important food commodities in the Pacific islands, the Asia mainland and in North America. The region also lies along the path of destructive typhoons that originate in the Western North Pacific and affect the Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China, Korea, and Japan. About 26 typhoons are generated annually in this region, the majority of which impact the Philippine region. Conserving the health and wellbeing of the marginal seas, and the peoples that rely on them, while coping with the pressures of global change, is an urgent imperative.</span></p> <p><span>Dubbed SIMSEA, the Sustainability Initiative in the Marginal Seas of East Asia, this initiative aims to:</span></p> <p><span>1) develop the knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change, and </span></p> <p><span>2) support transformation towards global sustainability in the region in the coming decades. </span></p> <p><span>The main region of the proposed study will be the Exclusive Economic Zone beyond the territorial limit (generally 12 nautical miles from shore) as well as in the international waters relevant to the sustainable use of common areas. The collaboration will involve joint researches and capacity building projects particularly of young scientist in developing countries in the region. </span></p> <p>The pre-scoping workshop held on 27 and 28 February, 2014 at the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences of JAMSTEC (<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/research/index.html\">http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/research/index.html</a>).

It provides guidance on the conduct of research collaborations between different institutions, disciplines, sectors, and countries. Such guidance is important as we develop research under the umbrella of Future Earth (<a href=\"../../../future-earth\">http://www.icsu.org/future-earth</a>), the new international research initiative on global sustainability. The statement builds on the Singapore Statement, issued after the 2nd World Conference, which was the first international effort to establish common principles and responsibilities for research integrity. Research across boundaries is indeed challenging when reward structures neither encourage multidisciplinary research nor reward collaborations, that enable research across disciplines, sectors and scales. The Statement outlines general responsibilities, and responsibilities in managing collaborations. The Statement draws attention to the fact that collaborating partners should take collective responsibility for the trustworthiness of the overall research and that the collaboration as a whole should have procedures in place for responding to allegations of misconduct or other irresponsible research practice by any of its members.</p> <p><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"MontrealStatementonResearchIntegrityJune21_2013.pdf\">Montreal Statement</a> on Research Integrity in Cross-boundary Research Collaborations</p> <p><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"Singporestatement.pdf\">Singapore Statement</a> on Research Integrity</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>International Research Collaboration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Freedom and responsibility</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Research integrity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global sustainability research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Universality of Science</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-10-18T20:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/icsu2019s-urban-health-programme-presented-at-international-conference-in-paris\">     <title>ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Urban Health Programme presented at international conference in Paris</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/icsu2019s-urban-health-programme-presented-at-international-conference-in-paris</link>     <description>ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds latest 10-year global research programme, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHealth and Wellbeing in the Changing Urban Environment: a Systems Analysis Approach\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd has started early development of projects in Asia. </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>One of these, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGreen transportation for better urban health\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, was presented earlier this month at a 3-day conference in Paris, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdUrban dynamics and health\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

The APN part funded the workshop that was organised as a first step to provide a regional context to the conceptualization of <i>Future Earth. </i>It was part of a broader ICSU consultation process on <i>Future Earth </i>in the regions. The workshop was successful in building an understanding of <i>Future Earth </i>among participants, providing information on current initiatives and developing a common vision for <i>Future Earth </i>in the Asia-Pacific region. The key recommendations made at the workshop refer to the coordination and convergence of activities under <i>Future Earth. </i>These included the needed learning and capacity development initiatives, and elements of science-policy and stakeholder interfaces required to make <i>Future Earth </i>a success. The Asia-Pacific region has the capacity to drive the transition towards global sustainability under the <i>Future Earth </i>programme. Its scientific community is ready to make the change to support integrated research that can build new ways to engage developed and less developed countries and help ensure socially-inclusive and environmentally-sound development.
