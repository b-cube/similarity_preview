Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.  In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.  In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. </abstract> <purpose>These data are supplied to provide the raw navigation collected by a LGBX Pro receiver and logged using HYPACK, Inc. navigation software (www.hypack.com) during USGS field activity 2005-004-FA.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20050725</begdate> <enddate>20050729</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-71.390517</westbc> <eastbc>-71.361103</eastbc> <northbc>43.728543</northbc> <southbc>43.710999</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>General</themekt> <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey> <themekey>USGS</themekey> <themekey>Coastal and Marine Geology Program</themekey> <themekey>CMGP</themekey> <themekey>Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center</themekey> <themekey>WHCMSC</themekey> <themekey>Marine Geology</themekey> <themekey>field activity number 2005-004-FA</themekey> <themekey>USGS CMGP InfoBank ID R-1-05-NH</themekey> <themekey>field activity number 05004</themekey> <themekey>Navigation</themekey> <themekey>Hypack</themekey> <themekey>LGBX Pro Receiver</themekey> <themekey>Wide Area Augmentation System</themekey> <themekey>WAAS</themekey> <themekey>R/V Rafael</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey> <themekey>location</themekey> <themekey>elevation</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>General</placekt> <placekey>North America</placekey> <placekey>United States</placekey> <placekey>New Hampshire</placekey> <placekey>Lake Winnipesaukee</placekey> <placekey>Moultonborough Bay</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>Data are not to be used for navigation.

WAAS is a  GPS-based navigation  system providing precision guidance to aircraft and provides  vertical accuracies of + or - 1.5 meters. Higher precision vertical positioning (for example, RTK-navigation) was not available during this survey effort.  Absolute water level values are reported as meters and referenced to  Mean Lake Level, which is defined to be 504.32 meters above Mean Sea Level (NGVD29). Mean Lake Level measured during the USGS geophysical survey (July 24 - July 30, 2005) averaged 4 feet above Mean Lake Level as reported by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (http://des.nh.gov/index.htm). This value (4 feet (1.3 meters)) is within the vertical accuracy of the survey. Therefore no additional offsets were applied to the data in order to reference to Mean Lake Level. </vertaccr> </vertacc> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin> <pubdate>Unpublished Material</pubdate> <title>Raw Hypack Navigation Data</title> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>online</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20050725</begdate> <enddate>20050728</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>none</srccitea> <srccontr>Raw navigation data were saved in HYPACK format (http://www.hypack.com), version 4.3.

The raw HYPACK navigation files are stored in separate directories indicating the acquisition Julian Day (JD206 through JD209), corresponding to July 25 - July 28, 2005. The filenames in each folder are in the format of linenumber_starttime.julianday. For example, filename 004_1434.207 represents HYPACK line number 004, start time 1434 and Julian Day 207.   Times are recorded in UTC (Coordinate Universal Time).  Filenames with the following format, 046A2028.206, indicate a rerun of a specific line.  For example,  046A2028.206 represents HYPACK line number 46,  &apos;A&apos; signifies a rerun of line 46, 2028 is the start time (HHMM) and 206 is the Julian day.  Filenames with the following format 25_1.206 represents planned line number 25_1 on Julian Day 206.  There is no start time listed in the filenames for these files.  An &apos;A&apos; in the filename signifies a rerun of a specific line.  For example, 25_1A.206 is a rerun of line 25_1 on Julian Day 206.  Julian Days (205, 206 and 207) directory also contains a LOG file that lists the files recorded during that Julian day. </procdesc> <procdate>2005</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Jane F.
