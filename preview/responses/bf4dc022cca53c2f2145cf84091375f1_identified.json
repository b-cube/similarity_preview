We generalize the Givental formula which is studied in the smooth case in [41] [42] [43] to the orbifold case. Specifically, we recover the higher genus Gromov-Witten invariants of a GKM orbifold X by its genus zero data. When X is toric, the genus zero Gromov-Witten invariants of X can be explicitly computed by the mirror theorem studied in [22] and our main theorem gives a closed formula for the all genus Gromov-Witten invariants of X. When X is a toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifold, our formula leads to a proof of the remodeling conjecture in [38]. The remodeling conjecture can be viewed as an all genus mirror symmetry for toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds. In this case, we apply our formula to the A-model higher genus potential and prove the remodeling conjecture by matching it to the B-model higher genus potential.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>",
