Respondents were asked whether they were familiar with the  European Code Against Cancer, how they felt about the sun, how much  time they spent in the sun, how they felt about exposing their  children to the sun, whether they had ever been sunburned, and whether  any immediate family member had been diagnosed with cancer or  skin cancer. Information on respondents' skin, eye, and natural hair  color was also elicited. Questions regarding smoking focused on  whether the respondent ever smoked or used to smoke but quit, and  whether they smoked manufactured cigarettes, roll-your-own cigarettes,  cigars, or pipes. Smokers were asked how many cigarettes a day they  smoked, if they would like to stop smoking, how many of their friends  and family members smoked, and if they supported or opposed a  regulation to prohibit smoking in public places. Demographic variables  include age, gender, marital status, occupation, income, number of children, and country of residence.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1992-02\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-02</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1992-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-03</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1992-02\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-02</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1992-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-03</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Belgium</geogCover>             <geogCover>Denmark</geogCover>             <geogCover>France</geogCover>             <geogCover>Germany</geogCover>             <geogCover>Greece</geogCover>             <geogCover>Ireland</geogCover>             <geogCover>Italy</geogCover>             <geogCover>Luxembourg</geogCover>             <geogCover>Netherlands</geogCover>             <geogCover>Portugal</geogCover>             <geogCover>Spain</geogCover>             <geogCover>United Kingdom</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                        <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          questionnaires             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 (1) The codebooks are in French and the data  collection instruments are in the native language of each of the 12  countries. The variables are repeated for each country. (2) In Part 1,  Base Data File, users should disregard the Portugal data for V152-V153  and the Belgium data for V132-V136. A second wave, representing a  different sample of respondents from each of these two countries, was  conducted to replace these data (Parts 2 and 3). Users should note  that, in addition to the data for the corrected variables, Parts 2 and  3 also contain data for several other variables that are identical to  the values for those variables found in Part 1. (3) The codebooks and  data collection instruments are provided as Portable Document Format  (PDF) files. The PDF file format was developed by Adobe Systems  Incorporated and can be accessed using the Adobe Acrobat  Reader. Information on how to obtain a copy of the Acrobat Reader is provided through the ICPSR Website on the Internet.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR06144.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
