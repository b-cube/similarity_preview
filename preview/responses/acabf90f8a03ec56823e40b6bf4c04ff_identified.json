Although this was a ground breaking result, it was later showed that the atmospheric conditions used in this experiment did not correspond to the ones of our primitive planet.</p> <p>As the Earth was heavily bombarded by comets, asteroids, meteorites and interplanetary dust particle (IDPs) 4.6 to 3.8 million years ago, the exogenous delivery of organic compounds is an alternative. In fact, carbonaceous meteorites have a rich organic inventory, and may have provided the first building blocks of life to the primitive Earth. As future space missions will investigate the possibility of past and/or present extra-terrestrial life, it is important to determine how life may have originated in other places of our solar system, and how to detect possible bio-signatures.</p> <p>This talk will discuss how the study of meteorites, asteroids, comets and Mars soil analogues is used to investigate the origin of life on Earth and how to detect any possible signatures of extra-terrestrial life in our solar system.</p> <p><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/public-events/research-lectures/zita-martins/research-lecture-zita-martins-flyer\">Flyer for this event</a></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <h2 class=\" \">Dr Zita Martins<img style=\"float: right; \" alt=\"Zita Martins_profile\" class=\"image-inline\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/assets/ZitaMartins.jpg/@@images/292810ad-3c84-441c-a64c-ab01cecf99ef.jpeg\" title=\"Zita Martins_profile\" /></h2> <p>Dr Zita Martins is a Royal Society University\\ufffd\\ufffdResearch Fellow at Imperial College London. Her research interests include the detection of bio-signatures in space missions, and the possible contribution of meteorites and comets to the origin of life on Earth. Dr Zita Martins has an MSc in Chemistry from Instituto Superior T\\ufffd\\ufffdcnico (Portugal, 2003) and a PhD in Astrobiology from the University of Leiden (The Netherlands, 2007). She was an Invited Scientist at NASA Goddard in 2005 and 2006, and an Invited Professor at the University of Nice-Sophia Antipolis (France) in 2012. After her PhD, Dr Martins moved to Imperial College London as Post-Doc Research Associate, and since 2009 she has been a Royal Society University Research Fellow.</p> <p>Dr Martins is a Co-Investigator in one European Space Agency (ESA-ELIPS) space mission experiment (OREOCube) which will be on-board the International Space Station, a member of two ESA Topical Teams (<i>Future Astrobiology Experiments in Earth orbit and beyond, </i>and<i> Lunar Exploitation of local planetary materials)</i>, and a Committee member of the Astrobiology Society of Britain (ASB). She has been an invited speaker in several international conferences including the Gordon Research Conference and the COSPAR Conference. Dr Martins has an active involvement with public outreach activities, including several international media interviews, and public talks at museums and Science festivals. She was selected as one of the BBC's Expert Women, and she had the honour of having her portrait sketched for the Royal Society exhibit about great women in science.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This study employed a questionnaire survey and focus groups with students in three disciplines at the University to explore students' perceptions and use of learning outcomes.</p> <p>The findings suggest that the majority of students find learning outcomes useful and use them to support their studies in various ways. However, the data also indicate that some students struggle to understand from their learning outcomes the level of learning required to cover their topic area or to pass assessments.</p> <p>Additionally, certain respondents reported that learning outcomes can restrict or overfragment their knowledge.

Via Google+ Hangout on Air, the event was broadcast live on YouTube. The students joined 8 other teams from around the UK, including Cambridge, Edinburgh and UCL, to present their ideas.</p> <p>During their slot at 1.50pm, the Leicester team shared their project which focuses on expanded polystyrene; whilst a useful product, it is a recycling nightmare, and micro-organisms that can digest it are very rare in the environment and work very slowly. To combat this major waste issue, the students aim to use a genetically engineered machine (a modified bacterium) to recycle polystyrene efficiently. By taking the active genes out of specific soil bacteria and inserting them into a more easily grown bacterium, they aim to improve the rate of degradation of polystyrene.</p> <p>Aside from the team presentations, there were talks by academics, and most notably by Dr Adam Rutherford, a TV and radio presenter known for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe Gene Code\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd on BBC4.</p> <p>The broadcast from the UK iGEM Team Meet- Up is available to see on the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/NRPUEAiGem\">NRP- UEA iGEM Team\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds YouTube page</a>.</p> <p>For more information on the project, the&nbsp;University of Leicester team post regular updates on their <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://uoleicesterigem2012.blogspot.co.uk/\">blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>uatemp13</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biological Sciences</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-08-28T09:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
