Separate group interviews were conducted amongst low income samples (5 groups), non-low income samples (5 groups), and mixed income samples (4 groups). These groups were also stratified by household type (11 groups) and minority ethnic status (3 groups).</abstract>       <sumDscr>         <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2010-11-01T00:00:00Z\">01 November 2010</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2010-12-30T00:00:00Z\">30 December 2010</timePrd>         <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z\">01 April 2010</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z\">31 March 2014</collDate>         <nation>Northern Ireland</nation>         <nation>Scotland</nation>         <nation>England</nation>         <nation>Wales</nation>         <anlyUnit>individuals</anlyUnit>         <dataKind>Textual</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <collMode>Since the aim of focus groups was generally to achieve consensus amongst participants, variability in public perceptions of the necessities of life needed to be taken into account in the recruitment of participants. The recruitment plan was based on a quota sample design which aimed to promote homogeneity in group composition with regard to factors relevant to participants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd views, including: * income status, household type, and ethnic origin (primary strata) * gender, age, housing tenure, employment status, age of children (secondary strata) A total of 14 focus group interviews were conducted in November and December 2010 in five different locations, including in each of the four territories comprising the UK: Bristol, Cardiff, London, Glasgow and Belfast. Separate group interviews were conducted amongst low income samples (5 groups), non-low income samples (5 groups), and mixed income samples (4 groups). These groups were also stratified by household type (11 groups) and minority ethnic status (3 groups).  Focus group interviews typically comprised 6 to 10 participants with three groups being conducted in each location. Each group lasted approximately 2.5 hours in total. Participants were professionally recruited and all participants received a one-off gift payment of \\ufffd\\ufffd35 plus travel expenses in recognition for their contribution to the research. Prior to attending their group discussion, participants completed the following instrumentation: *A recruitment survey collecting respondent socio-demographic data *A brief open-format questionnaire on deprivation, living standards and social exclusion The main aim of the pre-group instrumentation was to encourage participants to begin to think in advance about suitable indicators of deprivation and indicators of wider living standards in the UK today. The recruitment survey also provided useful contextual information on the socio-demographic profile of the fourteen groups. A fuller description of the sample is provided in Appendix 2. In total, 114 participants took part in the 14 group interviews of whom 54% were female and 46% male. Over half (55%) of respondents reported monthly household incomes of less than \\ufffd\\ufffd1,500, and exactly half the sample were owner occupiers. Single person households comprised 30% of the sample, and well over half (57%) of respondents cared for dependent children.</collMode>         <sources />       </dataColl>     </method>     <dataAccs>       <setAvail>         <accsPlac>UK Data Service</accsPlac>       </setAvail>       <useStmt>         <contact>&lt;a href=\"mailto:dave.gordon@bristol.ac.uk\"&gt;Dave Gordon, University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;</contact>         <contact>&lt;a href=\"mailto:eldin.fahmy@bristol.ac.uk\"&gt;Eldin Fahmy, University of Bristol&lt;/a&gt;</contact>       </useStmt>     </dataAccs>     <othrStdyMat />   </stdyDscr> </codeBook>",
