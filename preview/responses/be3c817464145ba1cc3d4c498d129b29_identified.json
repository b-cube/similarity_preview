CREATe understands evidence here as empirically grounded, but open to historical and comparative approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</ab>   <la/>   <k1/>   <pb/>   <pp/>   <yr>2014-10-12</yr>   <ed/>   <ul>https://zenodo.org/record/12219/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2014-09.pdf;  https://zenodo.org/record/12219/files/CREATe-Working-Paper-2014-09.png?subformat=icon-90;  </ul>   <no>Imported from Invenio.</no> </reference>   </references>",
