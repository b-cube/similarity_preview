These types of data, referred to as the general canvass landings statistics, have been collected by the NOAA Fisheries Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and its predecessor agency, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries.   The data are available on computer since the early 1960's.  The quantities and values that are reported in this data set include the annual landings that were initiated in 1962.  Beginning in 1976, the data were collected monthly.  See the sections on Links for the reference to the monthly general canvass landings.  The annual general canvass landings include quantities and value for all living marine species and are identified by species (usually the local or common name).  These data were collected by field agents employed by the National Marine Fisheries Service or the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and assigned to local fishing ports.   The agents contacted the majority of the seafood dealers or brokers in their assigned areas and recorded the quantities and value for each species or species category from the sales receipts maintained by the seafood dealers.    In addition, information on the gear and area of capture is available for most of the landings statistics in the data set.  Based on their knowledge of the fishing activity in the area, the agents would estimate the type of fishing gear and area where the fishing was likely to have occurred.  More detailed information on the caveats associated with these data is provided in the Characteristics, Caveats and Issues section.  However, because these data are summaries, they do not contain information on the quantities of fishing effort or identifications of the fishermen or vessels that caught the fish or shellfish.  </abstract>       <purpose>One of the original purposes for these data was to provide estimates of the quantities and value of the marine commercial fishing industries throughout the United States as part of the gross national product for the nation.  As the fishing industry continued to grow, the importance of this time series became obvious as a method to monitor the trends in commercial fishing activity.   Although the initial methods of collecting the general canvass statistics have been replaced with the states? trip ticket programs, monthly summaries from the states? programs are provided to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center in order to maintain the time series established by the general canvass data set.    In addition to trends in landings statistics, the general canvass landings data provide comprehensive statistics for the total quantities of marine resources that are caught and brought ashore (landed) for all species in the Southeast Region.   </purpose>       <notes/>       <supplemental-info>These are fishery dependent data reported by industry.

Florida data are reported and stored in landed weight until the end of 1985, after which they are converted to whole weight.  Conversion factors are used by the data suppliers to convert landings to whole weight pounds. Generally, these follow standards established in a NMFS Memo `Conversion Factors' issued January 12, 1987; however, conversion factors from Texas and North Carolina may vary from the official NMFS factors.  The Texas and North Carolina conversion factors for are available from the states.  Care must be used when converting these data back to landed weight.  If the original conversion factors are not employed the weight will vary from that of the data supplier.  The State of Florida uses the NMFS standard set of factors but applies them according to the typical landed condition of the for most fish species.  Florida collects a landed condition for shellfish and for some baitfish. </summary>       </issue>       <issue ccid=\"4636\"              type=\"\"              last-modified=\"2013-04-09T16:19:27\"              created=\"2006-07-10T05:56:00\">          <date>2006-07-10</date>          <author>Josh Bennett</author>          <summary>NOTES on Catch Area (WATERBODY):   Fishing area information is located in the `WATERBODY' column and is recorded as statistical grids (sometime referred as stat zones).  The grids in the Atlantic are formed by the degrees of latitude and longitude.  Thus, the statistical grids are approximately 60 miles by 60 miles or about 3,600 square miles.  In the Gulf of Mexico the grids are more irregular, bordered by one or several degrees of latitude and longitude.  Within the coastal grids there are usually many specific catch areas.   Numeric codes of 4 digits are assigned to all catch areas.  In the Atlantic the grid or stat zone indicator occupies the first 3 digits of the code while in the Gulf of Mexico the grid indicator occupies the 2 middle digits.  Catch areas that occur within the grids are coded with the grid code along with additional coding in the 1st and 4th digit (Gulf) and in the 4th digit (Atlantic).  There are also records with general catch areas such as `Gulf of Mexico', `Atlantic Ocean', `Unknown', and a few others.  Users must be careful to query for the catch areas accordingly.  There is a REGION code that identifies the catch area as Atlantic (4), Gulf (5), or Caribbean (9).  These are useful in data retrieval of catch area data.  Use the ALSSTATE and NMFSCOUNTY fields to retrieve landings for the area landed, and use the `REGION' and `WATERBODY' fields to retrieve landings by catch area. The validation table for water body codes contains the conversions and definition for each species.  The table name is ALS.ALS_WATERBODY_OLD_NEW_XREF.

These landings statistics include all living marine species and are identified by species (usually the local or common name).  These data are collected by field samplers employed by the Department of Natural Resources through a voluntary trip ticket program.   The program collects data on the type and amount of gear, the fishing location and the fishing center where the catches are landed.  Approximately, 80% of the fishermen are included in the trip ticket program.   Data for the individual trips are provided to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC).  In order to make these data consistent with other monthly landings statistics stored in the Accumulative Landings System, the data are summarized for each calendar month by gear, fishing center and fishing area and the species and gear codes are converted to the standard National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) codes.   </abstract>          <relation-note>Puerto Rico Landings.</relation-note>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"2201\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"RI\">          <title>Southeast Region 1972-1976 general canvass statistics</title>          <abstract>This data set, in the table ALS.ALS_LANDINGS7278 contains annual and monthly quantities and values for all seafood products that are landed within the Southeast Region and sold by established seafood dealers and brokers.  It complements the table ALS.ALS_LANDINGS.  These types of fishery-dependent data, referred to as the general canvass landings statistics, have been collected by the NOAA Fisheries Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and its predecessor agency, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and more recently by our State partner agencies under the Cooperative Statistics Program.  These data are available on computer since the early 1960's.  The quantities and values that are reported in this data set include the annual and monthly landings that were initiated in 1972.  Between 1962 and 1971, the data for were collected annually and not monthly.  See the sections on Links for the reference to the annual general canvass landings.  The general canvass landings from 1972-1976 include quantities and values for all marine commercial landings and are identified by species (usually the local or common name).  These data are collected from or reported by every seafood dealer or broker that is licensed by each state in the Southeast Region (North Carolina through Texas). Information on the gear and area of capture is available for most of the landings statistics in the data set (please see Issues for exceptions); however, they are summary records and do not contain information on the quantities of fishing effort or identify the fishermen or vessels that caught the fish or shellfish. This table contains data from FL-TX for the years 1972-1976.  The ALS.ALS_LANDINGS table contains data for GA-NC for the same period as well as all the more recent monthly data.  In the early years, the data in this data set were collected by field agents employed by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center and assigned to local fishing ports.  The field agents canvassed the seafood dealers and recorded the quantity and value for each species or species category from the dealer?s  receipts.  Based on interviews with dealers and fishermen as well as their own detailed knowledge of the fishing activity in the area, the agents would determine the type of fishing gear and area where the fishing occurred. In addition, summarized data are extracted from the NOAA-SEFSC Gulf Shrimp System for commercial landings of shrimp species that are landed at ports in the coastal area of the Gulf of Mexico.  </abstract>          <relation-note>Landings from 1972-1976 (except for NC,SC,GA which are in ALS.ALS_LANDINGS)</relation-note>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"1916\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"RI\">          <title>Southeast Region Monthly General Canvass Landings Statistics: ALS.ALS_LANDINGS table.</title>          <abstract>This data set contains monthly quantities and values for all seafood products that are landed within the Southeast Region and sold by established seafood dealers and brokers.

Based on interviews with dealers and fishermen as well as their own detailed knowledge of the fishing activity in the area, the agents would determine the type of fishing gear and area where the fishing occurred.   In more recent years, the states in the Southeast Region began to implement trip ticket programs that required the licensed seafood dealer/brokers to report the landings of all seafood products.  A trip ticket program was initiated in Florida in 1985, in Louisiana in 1999 and in Alabama in 2000.    In addition to the quantities of these landings, the states require dealers to report the price, the type of gear and the fishing area for each trip.  Through cooperative agreements with each of the states, monthly summaries of the states? trip ticket programs are provided to the Southeast Fisheries Science Center (SEFSC) and are included in the general canvass landings data set.  In addition, summarized data are extracted from the NOAA-SEFSC Gulf Shrimp System for commercial landings of shrimp species that are landed at ports in the coastal area of the Gulf of Mexico. </abstract>          <relation-note>Monthly landings for 1972 and more recent for NC,SC, and GA and for all other states from 1977 on.</relation-note>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"1920\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"RI\">          <title>U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS LANDINGS STATISTICS</title>          <abstract>This data set contains quantities and values for all seafood products that are reported landed in St. Thomas, St. Croix or St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands.
