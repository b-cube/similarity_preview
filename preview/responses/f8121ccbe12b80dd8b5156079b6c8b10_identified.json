on Disaster Risk Reduction closed today in Sendai, Japan, with negotiations coming to a successful conclusion after a contentious deliberations marathon than ran through the night and into the evening of March 18.  </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>As the organizing partner of the Science and Technology Major Group, the International Council for Science welcomes the strong recognition of science in the Sendai Framework for Action 2015-2030, which the conference adopted at its conclusion, and the need to strengthen its relevance and use for DRR from the global to local scales.</p> <p>In an <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"statement-science-and-technology-major-group-sendai\">official statement to the conference</a>, the Major Group for Science and Technology had <br />acknowledged the strong call in the draft of the new framework for science to support the understanding of disaster risk and promote risk-informed decisions and risk sensitive planning from the local to the global levels.</p> <p>The statement also emphasizes the need to break down the isolation of scientific knowledge, and actively assist governments and others in the uptake and use of this knowledge by fostering partnerships across existing institutions and networks to scale up the application of science to decision-making at all levels.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe success of the post-2015 framework hinges on creating and implementing policies that are built on the best available knowledge. The scientific community stands ready to provide that knowledge and to play its part beyond Sendai, and beyond 2015,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the statement said.</p> <p>The Science and Technology Major Group brought together in Sendai nearly 400 delegates from a wide range of organizations and networks active across all disciplines and sectors. Looking ahead, ICSU is eager to continue its engagement in the disaster risk reduction framework. Together with UNISDR, with which it has a long history of successful collaboration \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd including through co-sponsorship of the <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"../../../what-we-do/interdisciplinary-bodies/irdr\">IRDR programme</a>.</p> <p>ICSU with partners \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd UNISDR, UKCDS, the Science Council of Japan \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd have proposed an international scientific partnership. This partnership would support the implementation of the post-2015 framework and would better coordinate and enhance existing capacities and deliver concrete outputs around four functions \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd assessment, synthesis, advice and monitoring \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and two cross-cutting capabilities \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd communication and engagement, capacity building.</p> <p>The Sendai Framework calls for an enhancement of the STAG as one mechanism to scale up the mobilization of science for DRR. A functional STAG is an important element for the successful implementation of the Sendai Framework given its advisory role to UNISDR and ICSU is keen to support UNISDR in this process following Sendai. ICSU is also keen to work with UNISDR and other partners to prepare for the implementation of the overall Sendai Framework regarding the broad needs and priorities expressed to which science needs to contribute, especially through coordination of existing networks.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-18T15:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/allan-lavell-wins-united-nations-sasakawa-award-for-disaster-risk-reduction\">     <title>Allan Lavell wins United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Risk Reduction</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/allan-lavell-wins-united-nations-sasakawa-award-for-disaster-risk-reduction</link>     <description>Allan Lavell, a key member of the community of the ICSU co-sponsored Integrated Research on Disaster Risk programme (IRDR), has been awarded the prestigious prize that is awarded to individuals or institutions that have taken active efforts in reducing disaster risk in their communities and advocated for disaster risk reduction. </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>During a ceremony at the 3rd World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, Lavell was announced as winner of the prestigious United Nations Sasakawa Award for Disaster Risk Reduction.

In many regions, natural hazards are becoming direct threats to national security because their impacts are amplified by rapid growth and unsustainable development practices. Reducing disaster risk is a foundation for sustainable development.</p> <p>Science-supported approaches to disaster risk reduction and management can help communities and governments become more resilient and reduce the human and economic impacts of disasters. Science plays a significant role in all stages of both understanding disaster risk and its management. Scientists can do more to co-produce and deliver scientific knowledge on disasters and disaster risks for policymakers and society by providing robust, evidence-based frameworks and a variety of knowledge products (e.g., concepts, tools, technology, data, advices, training) for social policy engagement, development, and implementation.</p> <p>An international, multidisciplinary group of experts has reviewed and synthesized basic knowledge of natural hazards,  vulnerabilities and disaster risks. It aims to highlight potential  contributions of science to disaster risk reduction. This was done in order to provide  policy-makers with the knowledge necessary to assist risk mitigation and  management.\\ufffd\\ufffd<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"../../science-for-policy/disaster-risk/documents/DRRsynthesisPaper_2015.pdf\">A paper on the subject was released on the occasion of WCDRR</a>. The review was coordinated by the International Council for Science (ICSU), the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.worldsocialscience.org\">International Social Science Council</a> (ISSC)  and the <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"../../what-we-do/interdisciplinary-bodies/irdr\">Integrated Research on Disaster Risks</a> (IRDR)\\ufffd\\ufffd programme.</p> <p>The paper calls for significant improvements of existing assessment processes thorugh scientific advice on disaster risks to support and catalyze disaster policy development and management across governments. Comprehensive periodic assessments of disaster risks from\\ufffd\\ufffd local to global levels should be undertaken by a high-level, transdisciplinary body of experts appointed by national governments together with international and intergovernmental scientific organizations dealing with disaster risks.</p> <p>Through a participatory process of working with civil society and relevant stakeholders, this international body should produce a clear and unambiguous scientific view on the current state of knowledge in disaster risk, the potential socio-economic impacts of natural hazards, and the ways to reduce (if not prevent) significant human and economic losses. The development and strengthening of assessment process will facilitate the inclusion of cultural and cross-cultural perspectives. It will also produce robust, unambiguous evidence of economic, operational, and strategic benefits of using scientific knowledge and information to address hazard prevention, disaster mitigation, and response actions.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-18T02:13:12Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/top-news/statement-science-and-technology-major-group-sendai\">     <title>Statement by the Science and Technology Community Major Group at the Sendai conference</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/top-news/statement-science-and-technology-major-group-sendai</link>     <description>On the third day of the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, David Johnston, chair of the IRDR Science Committee, delivered the official statement of the Science and Technology Major Group to the conference.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>In it, the community acknowledges the strong call in the draft of the new framework for science to support the  understanding of disaster risk and promote risk-informed decisions and  risk sensitive planning from the local to the global levels.</p> <p>The statement also emphasizes the need to break down the isolation of scientific  knowledge, and actively assist governments and others in the uptake and  use of this knowledge by fostering partnerships across existing institutions and networks to scale up the  application of science to decision-making at all levels.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe success of the post-2015 framework hinges on creating and  implementing policies that are built on the best available knowledge.

Together we develop knowledge and solutions to address disaster risk and build resilience. </span></p> <p><span>The Post-2015 Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction makes a strong call for science to support the understanding of disaster risk and to promote risk-informed decisions and risk sensitive planning from the local to the global levels. </span><span>It also calls for the coordination of existing networks and scientific research institutions at all levels</span><span> and all regions with the support of the ISDR Science and Technology Advisory Group. The goal is to strengthen the evidence-base in support of the implementation of the new framework.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p> <p><span>If we want to continue to deepen our understanding of evolving risks, the root causes of disasters and their impact on development, we need actionable research that is useful, usable and used. Scientists and researchers must work with policy-makers and practitioners to co-design and co-produce  research that can be used effectively. The science and technology community can support better monitoring and forecasting, help develop scenarios and identify options to manage risk (including related to climate change), propose resilient and sustainable development pathways and  test potential solutions to assess their effectiveness and viability. </span></p> <p><span>The scientific and technological community is committed to supporting the implementation and monitoring of the Framework in multiple ways. These include:</span></p> <ul> <li> <p><span>Assessment.  Science can provide analytical tools to assess and advance our  knowledge of hazard, risk, and underlying risk drivers. It can also  evaluate the need for a regular, independent, policy-relevant  international assessment of available science on disaster risk  reduction, resilience and transformation to achieve a more  comprehensive view of disaster risk.</span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span>Synthesis.   To facilitate the  uptake of scientific evidence in policy-making,  we need to synthesize it in a timely, accessible and policy-relevant  manner.</span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span>Scientific  advice. To translate knowledge into solutions, the science community  can provide advisory capabilities integrating all fields of science,  technology and innovation in collaboration with practitioners and  policy-makers. </span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span>Monitoring  and review. The science and technology community is ready to support  the development of science-based indicators, common methodologies  and processes to harness data and information to promote their  availability and use at different scales.</span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span>Communication  and engagement. We need to build closer partnerships between policy  and research and between researchers themselves. We need to improve   the communication of scientific knowledge to facilitate  evidence-based decision-making at all levels of government and  across sectors of society. </span></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><span>And  finally,  capacity building. Risk literacy needs to be promoted  through curricular reform, professional training and life-long  learning across all sectors of society.</span></p> </li> </ul> <p><span>A wealth of scientific and technological initiatives supporting disaster risk reduction around the world  are presented here in Sendai.  For example, Global Earthquake Model provides visual tools to better communicate earthquake risk. The Peri-Peri U initiative builds partnerships across African universities to build capacity and support locally relevant research. The DATA project of the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (IRDR) programme works to harmoni</span><span>z</span><span>e disaster loss data. Finally, the International Council for Science and the International Social Science Council are conducting a review of scientific knowledge available to date to support disaster risk reduction and management. </span></p> <p><span>We have learned from the Hyogo Framework for Action that in order to stop the increasing rate of loss of lives and livelihoods we, the science and technology community, must break down the isolation of scientific knowledge. We need to actively assist governments and others in the uptake and use of this knowledge. This requires fostering deeper and wider partnerships across existing institutions and networks to scale up the application of science to decision-making at all levels.</span></p> <p><span>The success of the post-2015 framework hinges on creating and implementing policies that are built on the best available knowledge. The scientific community stands ready to provide that knowledge and to play its part beyond Sendai, and beyond 2015.</span></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-16T09:10:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/top-news/icsu-at-wcdrr-201capplying-science-and-technology-to-disaster-risk-reduction-decision-making201d\">     <title>ICSU at WCDRR: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdApplying Science and Technology to Disaster Risk Reduction Decision-making\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/top-news/icsu-at-wcdrr-201capplying-science-and-technology-to-disaster-risk-reduction-decision-making201d</link>     <description>Day two of the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan featured a working session on how to apply science and technology to disaster risk reduction decision-making.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The session \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which drew around 350 participants \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd was chaired by Carlos  Nobre, Director, Centro Nacional de Monitoramento e Alertas de  Desastres Naturais (CEMADEN) and moderated by Flavia Schlegel, Assistant  Director-General for Natural Sciences, United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). ICSU President Gordon  McBean was on the panel.<br /> <br /> Nobre highlighted the critical role of science and technology in the  current draft of the post-2015 DRR framework in all four priority areas. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIn this document, science and technology are not seen as a means of  implementation but as having an intrinsic value. This is very gratifying  for a scientist to see,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd he said. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAs a scientist I see that over the last 20 years, since Rio in 1992,  scientists are becoming much more engaged in policymaking, including  engaging with policymakers.

The report is an independent scientific review by over 40 scientists of the Sustainable Development Goals targets, with a view to assist their consolidation, and support their effective implementation and monitoring. The event brought together a wide range of stakeholders, government delegates and UN staff. Altogether, about 70 people attended.</p> <p>Several scientists who contributed to the review were present to discuss and illustrate the role of science in defining measurable targets and robust indicators to support the ambition of the SDGs. Lucilla Spini, Head of Science Programmes at ICSU, moderated the event. Anne-Sophie Stevance, lead coordinator of the review at ICSU introduced the report, its methodology and key findings highlighting the importance of the report as a tool for strengthening the targets as well as the broader contributions that science can play in building a robust and evidence-based Post-2015 Agenda.</p> <p>Claudia Ringler from the International Food Policy Research Institute reflected on the interconnected nature of the SDGs, and in particular SDG 2 on tackling hunger, food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture, which will require contributions from other goals and targets during implementation and monitoring. She also highlighted the importance of identifying and managing critical synergies and trade-offs across the SDG framework, especially with goals such as climate change or water and sanitation.</p> <p>Berta Mart\\ufffd\\ufffdn-L\\ufffd\\ufffdpez illustrated how social and natural systems interplay from local to the global scale and discussed the need for a multi-scale approach to successfully deliver the SDGs, and in particular for the preservation, restoration and promotion of the sustainable use and management of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems at local, regional and global scales.</p> <p>Susan Parnell, from the African Center for Cities and University of Cape Town, emphasised the importance of the cities as a key implementation scale of sustainable development, and where innovations and transformative actions can be nurtured.</p> <p>Finally, Michelle Scobie from the University of West Indies addressed key requirements to embed the SDGs in national policies with a particular focus on Small Island Developing States. Governance and institutional arrangements will be key to translate global goals into locally-relevant priorities and action. This will require facilitating processes for better governance including through the participation of non-state actors, capacity building and knowledge-sharing.</p> <p>Discussion from the floor raised a number of questions including on the engagement of the scientific community with the process to define indicators for the SDGs and in particular work undertaken on integrated indicators that could help better the interconnected nature of the SDGs.</p> <p>The report was covered in <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6223/702.full\">Science</a> (paywall), <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.scidev.net/global/mdgs/news/un-pitfalls-vague-sdg-targets.html\">SciDevNet</a>, <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://tmsnrt.rs/1zcJfAA\">Reuters AlertNet</a> and the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://wef.ch/1E7ip0b\">World Economic Forum blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Johannes Mengel</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-02T11:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/international-symposium-on-science-assessment-and-research-integrity\">     <title>International symposium on science assessment and research integrity</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/news-centre/news/international-symposium-on-science-assessment-and-research-integrity</link>     <description>Through its Committee on Freedom and Responsibility in the conduct of Science (CFRS), the International Council for Science is engaged in the promotion of a responsible conduct of science.

However, of the 169 targets beneath the 17 draft goals, just 29% are well defined and based on the latest scientific evidence, while 54% need more work and 17% are weak or non-essential.</p> <p>Many of the targets suffer from a lack of integration, some repetition and rely too much on vague, qualitative language rather than hard, measurable, time-bound, quantitative targets, the report finds.</p> <p>Authors are also concerned the goals are presented in \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsilos.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The goals address challenges such as climate, food security and health in isolation from one another. Without interlinking there is a danger of conflict between different goals, most notably trade-offs between overcoming poverty and moving towards sustainability. Action to meet one target could have unintended consequences on others if they are pursued separately.</p> <p>Finally, the report highlights the need for an \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdend-goal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to provide a big picture vision for the SDGs. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdultimate end\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of the SDGs in combination is not clear, nor is how the proposed goals and targets would contribute to achieve that ultimate end,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd write the authors.
