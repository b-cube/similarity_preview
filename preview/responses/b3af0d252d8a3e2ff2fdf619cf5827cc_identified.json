The Preservation Network will be a network of repository and redundant systems, located initially across the State of Texas, which will be able to manage and co-locate data for future research endeavors, as well as preserving data against potential failure at any one location.&#13; &#13; The Preservation Network is now in its first stages, with testing underway between Austin and College Station locations. TDL will describe the project, provide updates as to their current status, and goals for the near and far future of the project.

The TDL is developing applications such as open-access institutional repositories, collections management tools, and an electronic thesis and dissertation submission and management system. The organization also promotes new scholarly communication models through faculty services such as blogs, wikis, and peer-reviewed electronic journals.&#13; &#13; The TDL has employed numerous open-source technologies in its tool-kit, from implementing DSpace as its platform for member repositories, to enabling cross-institution single sign-on for TDL members using the Shibboleth distributed authentication system. Other open-source platforms used by the TDL include WordPress, Open Journal Systems, and MediaWiki. Future plans include the implementation of Open Monograph Press and Open Conference Systems.&#13; &#13; This presentation will discuss the ways in which the TDL, by leveraging its commitment to open-source technologies and the principle of open access, is empowering its members to collect, preserve, and promote the scholarly output of Texas universities. By providing an update on the current status of TDL services for faculty and institutions, highlighting recent developments and outlining plans for expansion of services, we will describe how TDL is connecting users with digital libraries across the state, and how that effort is connecting Texas Digital Library with the world This is a presentation from TCDL 2009. </summary> <dc:date>2009-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>ETD Management in DSpace</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2249.1/67066\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Mikeal, Adam</name> </author> <author> <name>Creel, James</name> </author> <author> <name>Maslov, Alexey</name> </author> <author> <name>Phillips, Scott</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2249.1/67066</id> <updated>2014-11-04T18:34:38Z</updated> <published>2009-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">ETD Management in DSpace Mikeal, Adam; Creel, James; Maslov, Alexey; Phillips, Scott The Texas Digital Library (TDL) is a consortium of public and private educational institutions from across the state of Texas. Founded in 2005, TDL exists to promote the scholarly activities of its members. One such activity is the collection and dissemination of ETDs. A federated collection of ETDs from multiple institutions was created in 2006, and has since grown into an all-encompassing ETD Repository project that is partially supported by a grant from the Institute for Museum and Library Sciences (IMLS). This project seeks to address the full life-cycle of ETDs, providing tools and services from the point of ingestion, through the review process, and finally to dissemination in the centrally federated repository.&#13; &#13; A primary component of this project was the development of Vireo, a web application for ETD submittal and management. Built directly into the DSpace repository, Vireo provides a customized submission process for students, and a rich, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWeb-2.0\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd style management interface for graduate and library staff. Because it is built directly in the DSpace repository, scalability is possible from a single department or college up to a multiple-institution consortium.&#13; &#13; In 2008, we reported the results of a demonstrator system that took place at Texas A&amp;M University. Vireo has replaced the legacy application and is now the single point of entry for all theses and dissertations at that university. Rollout to other schools will follow a gradual, phased approach. This presentation examines the challenges faced as Texas A&amp;M transitioned to a new ETD management system, and the architectural issues involved with scaling such a system to a statewide consortium. Finally, it will discuss the application\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds release to the ETD community under an open-source license.

Currently, the maintenance of this collection is performed via a manual process, leading to scalability issues as the collection grows. The DSpace OAI Harvesting project was started with the aim of improving current federation methods. It relies on integrating two key technologies into the DSpace repository platform: OAI-PMH and OAI-ORE.&#13; &#13; The Open Archives Initiative\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) is a well-established mechanism for harvesting metadata between repository systems. The DSpace platform supports metadata dissemination through OAI-PMH, allowing collections to be regularly harvested by external agents such as Google, or the NDLTD\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Union Catalog of ETDs. This protocol\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds ubiquity is well-deserved: it is simple and flexible, allowing for selective harvest by date ranges and sets, as well as specific metadata formats. Although dissemination through OAI-PMH has been a feature of DSpace for some time, harvesting support was missing, and was added as part of this project.&#13; &#13; As its name implies, OAI-PMH is concerned with metadata; it cannot transmit actual content. This need is addressed by another standard from OAI, called Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE). This protocol allows us to describe abstract sets of Web resources as nested groups called aggregations. The second part of this DSpace OAI Harvesting project was to make DSpace \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdORE-aware\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, so that when the harvesting engine encounters ORE descriptions, it is able to fetch the content from the remote repository and create a new local copy.&#13; &#13; This presentation will describe the OAI Harvesting project, and discuss its impact on the various TDL repositories, all of which use the DSpace platform. For the federated ETD collection, this technology will enable the maintenance of the collection to move from a manual process to an automatic one. It also opens up interesting possibilities for specializing various repositories for specific tasks; for example using a DSpace instance solely for ETD workflow and management and then harvesting the results into the main repository. Finally, we will discuss the impact of this project on repository architectures in general.
