Such&lt;br /&gt; corpora allow the analysis of phenomena spreading through multiple annotation layers, for&lt;br /&gt; example corpora like TueBaDZ (see: http://www.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ascl/ressourcen/corpora/tueba-dz.html), PCC (see: http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/acl-lab/Forsch/pcc/pcc.html), FALKO (see: https://u.hu-berlin.de/falko) and many other corpora contain annotations on syntactical, rhetorical, information structural and other layers. Often, annotations were created manually, or semi-automatically with different tools like EXMARaLDA (see: http://www.exmaralda.org/), TreeTagger (see: http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) and MMAX2 (see: http://mmax2.sourceforge.net/).&lt;br /&gt; These tools are powerful and usable but unfortunately only provide a minimum of&lt;br /&gt; interoperability, which impedes the creation of multi layer corpora. Thus, multiple layers of&lt;br /&gt; such corpora often had to be merged by hand or by very proprietary scripts implemented for&lt;br /&gt; just one use case and therefore could not be reused for other corpora easily.&lt;br /&gt; With this poster we present a tool which merges several layers of annotations into a single&lt;br /&gt; multi layer corpus. When creating a multi layer corpus, several analyses base on the same&lt;br /&gt; primary data and often also on the same tokenization.&lt;br /&gt; We started merging the data on the tokenization level and traversed bottom up, to merge even&lt;br /&gt; higher levels of annotation. This concept is implemented in a module for the converter&lt;br /&gt; framework Pepper (see: https://u.hu-berlin.de/saltnpepper) with use of the common meta-&lt;br /&gt; model Salt. By using Pepper, the merging module is able to handle all formats which can be&lt;br /&gt; imported by a Pepper module. Multi layered corpora then can be mapped into a multilayer&lt;br /&gt; formats like PAULA (Chiarcos et al. 2008), GrAF (Ide &amp;amp; Suderman 2007) or can be imported&lt;br /&gt; into ANNIS.&lt;/p&gt;</ab>   <la/>   <k1>Pepper;                 Salt;                 ANNIS;                 converter;                 conversion framework;                 linguistics;                 linguistic data;                 linguistic format;                 merging;                 corpora;                 multi-layer corpus;                 </k1>   <pb/>   <pp/>   <yr>2014-03-06</yr>   <ed/>   <ul>http://www.online.uni-marburg.de/dgfs2014/;  https://zenodo.org/record/15640/files/DGfS2014_poster_zipser_et_al.pdf;  </ul>   <no>Imported from Invenio.</no> </reference>   </references>",
