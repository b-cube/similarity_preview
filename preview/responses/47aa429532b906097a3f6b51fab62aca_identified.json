A longitudinal cohort study of newborn calves was conducted in western Kenya between 2007 and 2009. Calves were randomly selected from all those reported in a 2 stage clustered sampling strategy. Calves were recruited between 3 and 7 days old. A team of veterinarians and animal health assistants carried out routine 5-weekly visits, plus clinical examinations when the calves were reported ill and post-mortem visits. Blood and tissue samples were collected in association with all visits and screened using a range of laboratory based diagnostic methods for over 100 different pathogens or infectious exposures. The study followed 548 calves over the first 51 weeks of life or until death. Full details are given in Bronsvoort et al.

There is a pressing need to identify conserved signalling components among eukaryotes, which will lead to the transfer of knowledge across kingdoms. Two useful properties of a eukaryote model for signalling are (1) reduced signalling complexity, (2) conservation of signalling components. The alga Ostreococcus tauri is described as the smallest free-living eukaryote. With less than 8,000 genes, it represents a highly constrained genomic palette.&#13; &#13; Results&#13; &#13; Our survey revealed 133 protein kinases and 34 protein phosphatases (1.7% and 0.4% of the proteome). We conducted phospho-proteomic experiments and constructed domain structures and phylogenies for the catalytic protein-kinases. For each of the major kinases families we review the completeness and divergence of O. tauri representatives in comparison to the well-studied kinomes of the laboratory models Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and of Homo sapiens. Many kinase clades in O. tauri were reduced to a single member, in preference to the loss of family diversity, whereas TKL and ABC1 clades were expanded. We also identified kinases that have been lost in A. thaliana but retained in O. tauri. For three, contrasting eukaryotic pathways \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd TOR, MAPK, and the circadian clock \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd we established the subset of conserved components and demonstrate conserved sites of substrate phosphorylation and kinase motifs.&#13; &#13; Conclusions&#13; &#13; We conclude that O. tauri satisfies our two central requirements. Several of its kinases are more closely related to H. sapiens orthologs than S. cerevisiae is to H. sapiens. The greatly reduced kinome of O. tauri is therefore a suitable model for signalling in free-living eukaryotes. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-24T15:10:14Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
