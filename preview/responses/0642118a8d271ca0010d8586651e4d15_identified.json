Mac; MacAyeal, Douglas R. Supraglacial meltwater lakes trigger ice-shelf break-up and modulate seasonal ice&#13; sheet flow, and are thus agents by which warming is transmitted to the Antarctic&#13; and Greenland ice sheets. To characterize supraglacial lake variability we perform a&#13; comparative analysis of lake geometry and depth in two distinct regions, one on the&#13; pre-collapse (2002) Larsen B Ice Shelf, and the other in the ablation zone of&#13; Paakitsoq, a land-terminating region of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Compared to&#13; Paakitsoq, lakes on the Larsen B Ice Shelf cover a greater proportion of surface area&#13; (5.3% vs. 1%), but are shallower and more uniform in area. Other aspects of lake&#13; geometry, such as eccentricity, degree of convexity (solidity) and orientation, are&#13; relatively similar between the two regions. We attribute the notable difference in&#13; lake density and depth between ice-shelf and grounded ice to the fact that ice shelves&#13; have flatter surfaces and less distinct drainage basins. Ice shelves also possess more&#13; stimuli to small-scale, localized surface elevation variability due to the various&#13; structural features that yield small variations in thickness and which float at&#13; different levels by Archimedes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd principle.

During the past two decades, the sector ice discharge has increased 45-fold, the velocity regime has switched from predominantly slow (~ 101\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdm/yr) to fast (~ 103\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdm/yr) flow, and rates of ice thinning have exceeded 25\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdm/yr. At the time of widespread dynamic activation, parts of the terminus may have been near floatation. Subsequently, the imbalance has propagated 50\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkm inland to within 8\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkm of the ice cap summit. Our observations demonstrate the ability of slow-flowing ice to mobilize and quickly transmit the dynamic imbalance inland; a process that we show has initiated rapid ice loss to the ocean and redistribution of ice mass to locations more susceptible to melt, yet which remains poorly understood.

The explosive disintegration of the Larsen B Ice Shelf poses two unresolved&#13; questions: What process (1) set a horizontal fracture spacing sufficiently small to&#13; pre-dispose the subsequent ice-shelf fragments to capsize, and (2) synchronized the&#13; widespread drainage of &gt;2750 supraglacial meltwater lakes observed in the days&#13; prior to break-up? We answer both questions through analysis of the ice shelf\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds&#13; elastic-flexure response to the supraglacial lakes on the ice shelf prior to break-up.&#13; By expanding the previously articulated role of lakes beyond mere water-reservoirs&#13; supporting hydrofracture, we show that lake-induced flexural stresses produce a&#13; fracture network with appropriate horizontal spacing to induce capsize-driven&#13; break-up. The analysis of flexural stresses suggests that drainage of a single lake can&#13; cause neighboring lakes to drain, which, in turn, cause farther removed lakes to&#13; drain. Such self-stimulating behavior can account for the sudden, widespread&#13; appearance of a fracture system capable of driving explosive break-up. This is the accepted manuscript.

Although the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is losing mass at an accelerating rate, much uncertainty remains about how surface runoff interacts with the subglacial drainage system and affects water pressures and ice velocities, both currently, and into the future. Here, we apply a physically-based, subglacial hydrological model to the Paakitsoq region, west Greenland, and run it into the future to calculate patterns of daily subglacial water pressure fluctuations in response to climatic warming. The model is driven with moulin input hydrographs calculated by a surface routing model, forced with distributed runoff. Surface runoff and routing are simulated for a baseline year (2000), before the model is forced with future climate scenarios for the years 2025, 2050 and 2095, based on the IPCC\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Our results show that as runoff increases throughout the 21st century, and/or as RCP scenarios become more extreme, the subglacial drainage system makes an earlier transition from a less efficient network operating at high water pressures, to a more efficient network with lower pressures. This will likely cause an overall decrease in ice velocities for marginal areas of the GrIS. However, short-term variations in runoff, and therefore subglacial pressure, can still cause localized speedups, even after the system has become more efficient. If these short-term pressure fluctuations become more pronounced as future runoff increases, the associated late-season speedups may help to compensate for the drop in overall summer velocities, associated with earlier transitioning from a high to a low pressure system.
