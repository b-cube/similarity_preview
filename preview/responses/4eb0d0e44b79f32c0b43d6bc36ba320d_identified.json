The boundaries are derived from New York State                 Agricultural District, 1:24,000-scale, maps produced at county                 agencies. The district boundaries correspond to tax parcel data.                 District boundaries are joined into a file representing all of                 the Agricultural Districts within an entire county. Note that                 2003 legislation allows lands to be added to districts on an                 annual basis. Electronic data provided here may predate those                 additions. Tax parcel detail and secondary rights-of-way are not                 included in this dataset. Rights-of-way for state and federal                 highways, railroads and utilities are only included when they                 are delineated on the original 1:24,000 scale maps.

The electronic data only reflects changes to the                 1:24,000-scale maps. The Agricultural District boundaries are                 for use in conjunction with NYS geographical data (ex.

This was done by shipping blueprint copies of the maps to                     the NYS DEC for scanning. Digital Line Graph files were                     returned, which were converted to ArcInfo Coverages. These                     coverages represented one map sheet apiece. Original maps                     with multiple sheets were represented by multiple coverages.                     Coverages were compared to the original maps and edited as                     necessary to create an accurate representation of the Ag                     District boundaries shown on the maps. When accuracy was                     confirmed, coverages representing multiple sheets were                     merged to create district coverages. Districts were then                     merged to create county coverages. Merged districts                     sometimes created slivers, which were eliminated, and gaps,                     which are flagged with district value of zero. Overlaps                     between districts also occurred in a few cases. These were                     flagged with district value \"66\". For each coverage, an                     attribute table was built to record the information shown on                     the Cornell IRIS title block of each Ag District hardcopy                     map. These tables are further described in the Entity and                     Attribute Information section of the metadata.</procdesc>                 <procdate>19960100 through 20010131</procdate>                 <proccont>                     <cntinfo>                         <cntorgp>                             <cntorg>Cornell IRIS</cntorg>                         </cntorgp>                         <cntaddr>                             <addrtype>Mailing Address</addrtype>                             <address>302 Rice Hall</address>                             <address>Cornell University</address>                             <city>Ithaca</city>                             <state>New York</state>                             <postal>14853-5601</postal>                             <country>USA</country>                         </cntaddr>                         <cntvoice>607-255-6520 or 607-255-6529</cntvoice>                     </cntinfo>                 </proccont>             </procstep>             <procstep>                 <procdesc>2) CONVERSION FROM COVERAGES TO SHAPEFILES: Internal                     polygons were labeled zero; coverages were reprojected from                     UTMz18 NAD27 to UTMz18 NAD83; Coverages were converted to                     shapefiles; zero polygons were deleted; attribute table was                     modified: deleted fields are AREA, PERIMETER, FILE#,                     FILE_ID, AGDIST#, DOTQUADS. Modified fields are DISTCODE and                     DISTRICT. DISTCODE is 12 characters to accommodate changing                     abbreviations -- currently four characters and three digits                     to represent a key code for county name and district number.                     The field DISTRICT was enlarged to accommodate district                     numbers up to five digits. Also, DISTCODE, the key field,                     was moved to the end of the attribute table columns.</procdesc>                 <procdate>20080101 through 20080331</procdate>                 <proccont>                     <cntinfo>                         <cntorgp>                             <cntorg>Cornell IRIS</cntorg>                         </cntorgp>                         <cntaddr>                             <addrtype>Mailing Address</addrtype>                             <address>302 Rice Hall</address>                             <address>Cornell University</address>                             <city>Ithaca</city>                             <state>New York</state>                             <postal>14853-5601</postal>                             <country>USA</country>                         </cntaddr>                         <cntvoice>607-255-6520 or 607-255-6529</cntvoice>                     </cntinfo>                 </proccont>             </procstep>             <procstep>                 <procdesc>3) UPDATING COUNTY BOUNDARY DATA: County shapefiles                     are updated to reflect modifications that occurred during                     the eight-year review process. Boundaries are revised using                     one or more of the three methods: Tablet digitizing;                     On-screen digitizing; Copying boundaries from                     county-supplied shapefiles. All modifications are proofread                     against the original maps to confirm accuracy. Attributes                     are updated and checked against the information on the map                     title blocks, as well as information on file. If individual                     tax parcels are dissolved to form an aggregate boundary,                     slivers and gaps may be formed by drafting discrepancies.                     These are visually compared to the map and eliminated when                     they do not represent intended exclusions. Discrepancies                     between the title block information and file information are                     clarified by contacting the county and/or New York State
