Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 2-3 meters. The EAARL, developed originally by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.</abstract>    <purpose>The purpose of this project was to produce highly detailed and accurate digital elevation maps of a portion of the Mississippi and Alabama barrier islands, post-Hurricane Gustav (September 2008 hurricane), for use as a management tool and to make these data available to natural-resource managers and research scientists.</purpose>    <supplinf>Raw lidar data are not in a format that is generally usable by resource managers and scientists for scientific analysis. Converting dense lidar elevation data into a readily usable format without loss of essential information requires specialized processing. The U.S. Geological Survey's Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP) has developed custom software to convert raw lidar data into a GIS-compatible map product to be provided to GIS specialists, managers, and scientists. The primary tool used in the conversion process is Airborne Lidar Processing System (ALPS), a multi-tiered processing system developed by a USGS-NASA collaborative project. Specialized processing algorithms are used to convert raw waveform lidar data acquired by the EAARL to georeferenced spot (x,y,z) returns for \"first surface\" and \"bare earth\" topography. The terms first surface and bare earth refer to the digital elevation data of the terrain, but while the first-surface data include vegetation, buildings, and other manmade structures, the bare-earth do not. The zero crossing of the second derivative (that is, detection of stationary points) is used to detect the first return, resulting in \"first surface\" topography, while the trailing edge algorithm (that is, the algorithm searches for the location prior to the last return where direction changes along the trailing edge) is used to detect the range to the last return, or \"bare earth\" (the first and last returns being the first and last significant measurable portion of the return pulse). Statistical filtering, known as the Random Consensus Filter (RCF), is used to remove false bottom returns and other outliers from the EAARL topography data. The filter uses a grid of non-overlapping square cells (buffer) of user-defined size overlaid onto the original point cloud. The user also defines the vertical tolerance (vertical width) based on the topographic complexity and point sampling density of the data. The maximum allowable elevation range within a cell is established by this vertical tolerance. An iterative process searches for the maximum concentration of points within the vertical tolerance, and removes those points outside of the tolerance (Nayegandhi and others, 2009). These data are then converted to the North American Datum of 1983 and the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (using the GEOID09 model). Each file contains data located in a 2-kilometer by 2-kilometer tile, where the upper-left bound can be assessed quickly through the filename. The first 3 numbers in the filename represent the left-most UTM easting coordinate (e###000) in meters, the next 4 numbers represent the top-most UTM northing coordinate (n####000) in meters, and the last 2 numbers (##) represent the UTM zone in which the tile is located (ex. be_e123_n4567_18).  The development of custom software for creating these data products has been supported by the U.S. Geological Survey CMG Program's Decision Support for Coastal Science and Management project. Processed data products are used by the U.S. Geological Survey CMG Program's National Assessments of Coastal Change Hazards project to quantify the vulnerability of shorelines to coastal change hazards such as severe storms, sea-level rise, and shoreline erosion and retreat.</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>20080908</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>ground condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>None planned</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>3.5800 E+5</westbc>     <eastbc>3.6000 E+5</eastbc>     <northbc>3.34200 E+6</northbc>     <southbc>3.34000 E+6</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>elevation</themekey>     <themekey>http://remotesensing.usgs.gov/</themekey>     <themekey>Airborne Lidar Processing System</themekey>     <themekey>ALPS</themekey>     <themekey>Digital Elevation Model</themekey>     <themekey>DEM</themekey>     <themekey>EAARL</themekey>     <themekey>Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar</themekey>     <themekey>laser altimetry</themekey>     <themekey>lidar</themekey>     <themekey>remote sensing</themekey>     <themekey>topography</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>General</placekt>     <placekey>Mississippi</placekey>     <placekey>Alabama</placekey>     <placekey>Barrier Islands</placekey>    </place>    <stratum>     <stratkt>General</stratkt>     <stratkey>Bare Earth</stratkey>    </stratum>    <temporal>     <tempkt>General</tempkt>     <tempkey>2008</tempkey>     <tempkey>Post-Hurricane Gustav</tempkey>    </temporal>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>The U.S. Geological Survey and National Park Service request to be acknowledged as originators of this data in future products or derivative research.</useconst>   <ptcontac>    <cntinfo>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>      <address>600 4th Street South</address>      <city>St. Petersburg</city>      <state>FL</state>      <postal>33701</postal>      <country>USA</country>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>727 803-8747 (x3026)</cntvoice>     <hours>M-F, 9:00-5:00 EST</hours>     <cntperp>      <cntper>Amar Nayegandhi</cntper>      <cntorg>Jacobs Technology, U.S. Geological Survey, St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, St. Petersburg, FL</cntorg>     </cntperp>     <cntemail>anayegandhi@usgs.gov</cntemail>     <cntfax>727-803-2031</cntfax>     <cntpos>Remote Sensing Specialist/Project Manager</cntpos>    </cntinfo>   </ptcontac>   <datacred>Acknowledgment of the U.S. Geological Survey, St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, as a data source would be appreciated in products developed from these data, and such acknowledgment as is standard for citation and legal practices for data source is expected by users of this data.

The navigational data are processed and then, along with the raw data, are downloaded into ALPS, or the Airborne Lidar Processing System (20100309 - 20100712). Data are converted from units of time to x,y,z points for elevation and formatted into .las and .xyz files.
