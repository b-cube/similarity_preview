A 2-part survey was conducted, the first part focused on the respondents' household as the unit of analysis, information was collected for up to 15 respondents, although most households had only 4 to 6 respondents. The second part of the survey focused on individuals, the respondent's position in the household and their personal background. In the Individual dataset, observations were collected for up to 15 of the respondent's siblings. The 2 parts examined 4 samples of about 100 households, each stratified by region and urban/rural status in Vietnam with the household survey containing 403 household responses and the individual survey containing 921 respondents. Demographic variables in the Household dataset include region, household configuration, socioeconomic status, gender, ethnicity, appliance ownership, and house construction. Demographic variables in the Individual dataset include information on parents and siblings, familial occupations, ethnicity, sex, education, job history, marital status, and children information.         </abstract>                      <abstract>                    Data on households and individuals generated from 4 samples of about 100 households each, stratified by region and urban/rural status. Part 1 (Household Data) was administered as a household survey and Part 2 (Individual Data) was an individual questionnaire.           </abstract>                             <abstract>                    Survey data, household roster, and Life History Matrix. Part 1 contains 299 variables pertaining to household life. Specifically, variables in Part 1 (Household Data) include information on household structure, socio-economic factors, and household expenses. Part 2 (Individual Data) contains 2,192 variables pertaining to individuals inside of a household. These variables pertain to family life, employment history, and residence information.           </abstract>                       <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1926\" cycle=\"P1\">1926</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1991\" cycle=\"P1\">1991</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1991-01-15\" cycle=\"P1\">1991-01-15</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1991-03-11\" cycle=\"P1\">1991-03-11</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Can Tho</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>             <geogCover>Hai Duong</geogCover>             <geogCover>Long Ho</geogCover>             <geogCover>Vietnam (Socialist Republic)</geogCover>                   <geogUnit>village</geogUnit>                   <anlyUnit>household</anlyUnit>             <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>All households in Vietnam.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    There were 4 samples of about 100 households each stratified by region and urban/rural status.
