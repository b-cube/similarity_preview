Therefore, it is essential to manage these data properly to  ensure the highest quality and that they are useful in future.</p> <p>Planning for Data Management is valuable in mitigating risk to the  project deliverables and in ensuring longer term appropriate data access  and services are efficiently put in place. This page provides  information about the benefits of good data management and the general  expectations of data management during the research grant period. Each grant is  expected to have an active data management plan (DMP) that promotes a planned approach to data use during the project and making datasets of long-term value available for re-use.&nbsp;</p> <p>EIDC will provide staff for support and guidance in developing a data management plan. If<span>&nbsp;discussions with EIDC are not already ongoing, please identify a member of the project team to be the data lead as soon as possible. The data lead should contact Rick Stuart (</span><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"mailto:rstu@ceh.ac.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">rstu@ceh.ac.uk</a><span>;  01524 595826) with their contact details asap. A member of the Informatics Liaison team will be available to provide support and  guidance on data management planning.</span></p> <h5><a name=\"NERCBESSDataManagementGuidance-Datamanagementplanningbenefits\"></a>Data management planning benefits</h5> <p>Environmental data are often irreplaceable, usually unique and can be  extremely expensive to collect. Therefore it is important to ensure  that maximum benefits are derived from data once acquired. A planned  approach of how data are to be acquired, stored, managed and archived  for re-use will help to ensure the maximum benefit from good quality  data.</p> <p>Planning for data management has the following benefits:</p> <p><strong>Mitigation of risk to the project deliverables</strong> - planning  ahead helps mitigate risks to the data and its use; that data are fit  for analysis, that errors do not creep in, that required resources are  available when needed and that data that form the key resource for the  science are quality assured and secure.</p> <p><strong>Audit trail framework</strong> - planning of tasks defining how data  will be created, acquired, manipulated and analysed helps creates an  audit trail for the science publication. This process contributes to  creation of a transparent, repeatable process.</p> <p><strong>Quality Assurance framework</strong> - planning of tasks defining how  data will be created, acquired, manipulated and analysed helps define  levels of quality. Additional activities to ensure the quality of the  work actually undertaken and the resultant outputs build on these. This  process contributes to creation of quality assured science and products .</p> <p><strong>Co-ordination of approaches</strong> - ensures greater access to coordinated resources and promotes efficiency of effort from shared approaches.</p> <p><strong>Creation of a valuable science resource</strong> - ensures maximum  value is derived from the resource through the ability to use, re-use  and re-purpose good quality data. A planned approach can help to produce  data that are understood and compatible as far as possible with other  datasets.</p> <p><strong>Compliance with legal and funder requirements</strong> - planning of  tasks ensures efficiency of effort in meeting legal and funders'  requirements e.g. Defra UK Location Programme, BBSRC, NERC, INSPIRE,  FOI/EIR. A planned approach ensures tasks are implemented with  appropriate resource and timing.</p> <p><strong>Long-term security and web-accessible data</strong> - CEH's  Environmental Information Data Centre offers long-term secure storage of  data and access (subject to any constraints) to data via maintained  web-services (Defra's UK Location Programme /INSPIRE compliant).  Datasets are discoverable and viewable in association with any other  datasets accessible as an OGC webservice.</p> <p><strong>Acknowledgement and credit</strong><span>&nbsp;- depositing data with CEH's Environmental Information Data Centre will ensure that information on&nbsp;originating authorship will persist with the dataset in the future. A Digital Object Identifier can also be provided &nbsp;to be used as a citation reference for the dataset,&nbsp;acting as permanent link to the web-accessible metadata and data.&nbsp;</span></p> <h1><a name=\"NERCBESSDataManagementGuidance-TemplatesandGuidanceDocuments\"></a>Templates and Guidance Documents</h1> <div class=\"table-wrap\"> <table class=\"confluenceTable\"> <tbody> <tr> <th class=\"confluenceTh\"> Document Name </th> <th class=\"confluenceTh\"> Document Description </th> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"confluenceTd\"><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"resolveuid/2f5b244fc1c84e6aae8953a5fb1c0943\">Data Strategy Template</a></td> <td class=\"confluenceTd\">A template to set out the data management principles of a programme of work, what is expected from the award holders and what is expected from the EIDC</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"confluenceTd\"><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"resolveuid/1673ebfa259c4ba0992624d7e146adea\">EIDC Data Management Plan Template&nbsp;</a></td> <td class=\"confluenceTd\">An EIDC Data Management Plan template (incorporating the NERC DMP template).</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"confluenceTd\"><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"resolveuid/caf049a22635419cbbe2ef4a9b7fdc75\">EIDC Data Management Plan Guidance</a></td> <td class=\"confluenceTd\">Guidance for using the EIDC DMP template.</td> </tr> <tr> <td class=\"confluenceTd\"><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"resolveuid/566e86d2a25c4e07b70e1092038f4ef3\">Metadata Guidance</a><br class=\"atl-forced-newline\" /></td> <td class=\"confluenceTd\">Guidance on documentation required for datasets</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Pete Vodden</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-10-10T10:49:36Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/support-to-nerc-funded-researchers-1/support-to-nerc-funded-researchers\">     <title>Support to NERC-funded researchers</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/support-to-nerc-funded-researchers-1/support-to-nerc-funded-researchers</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h3>Our role</h3> <p>As one of the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/\">NERC Environmental Data Centres</a>, we provide support to NERC-funded researchers in:</p> <ul> <ul> <li><span>data management planning and&nbsp;</span><span>facilitating deposit of data of longterm value to an appropriate data centre</span></li> <li><span>long-term management and online access to secure datasets</span></li> </ul> </ul> <p><span>This is to ensure that data of long-term value that are generated are properly managed and accessible for future re-use.</span></p> <h3>Support from EIDC</h3> <p>EIDC liaison staff will:</p> <ul> <ul> <li>Provide support and guidance in development of a <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"resolveuid/241fa034dec94c68aa85310a22e834a3\">Data Management Plan</a> (DMP).</li> <li><span>Facilitate and oversee transfer of data of long-term value to EIDC and setting up of services e.g. secure online access.</span></li> </ul> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>If you are currently receiving a NERC grant (or shortly starting):&nbsp;</h4> <p>If you are a NERC-funded researcher and wish to develop a data management plan with our support please contact eidc@ceh.ac.uk with 'NERC DMP' as the subject.

Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) make it possible for datasets to be cited, and ensure those responsible for the dataset receive the credit they are due.&nbsp;</p> <h3></h3> <h3>Data Citation - available through the EIDC Hub</h3> <p>NERC, in collaboration with The British Library and DataCite has the ability to issue DOIs for datasets held in its Environmental Data Centres (of which EIDC is one). Once a dataset has been formally deposited into the EIDC Hub, and providing it meets certain criteria (see below), a DOI can be assigned or 'minted'. This DOI can then be used to refer to that particular dataset, for example in a paper, or may be required as part of the manuscript submission process. DOIs are also required if a researcher wishes to submit a data paper to a data journal.</p> <h3></h3> <h3>How does a DOI link to the data?</h3> <p>The DOI is a unique reference to a dataset and the issuing body (EIDC Hub) guarantee that when the DOI is resolved the user is taken to a 'landing page' which provides information about the dataset and how to access it.&nbsp;</p> <h3>How do I get one?</h3> <p>DOIs can be issued for datasets that have been deposited with the EIDC Hub provided they meet the following criteria. They must be:</p> <ul style=\"list-style-type: square; \"> <li>Stable (i.e.not going to be modified)]</li> <li>Complete (i.e. not going to be updated) *</li> <li>Permanent (Once ingested, the EIDC Hub will ensure the dataset is available in perpetuity)</li> <li>Good quality (By assigning a DOI, the EIDC Hub are giving the dataset a 'stamp of approval', saying it is complete and all the relevant metadata is available)</li> </ul> <p>* Note that for ongoing data, a \"snapshot\" from a point in time can be deposited and subsequently cited from a publication.</p> <h3>How to cite datasets with a DOI?</h3> <p>&nbsp;A citation should include enough information so that the exact version of the data being cited can be located. DOIs&nbsp;ensure that even if the location of the data changes, the DOI will always link to the data that were used.&nbsp;When using a DOI in subsequent publications you &nbsp;include the author(s) and date within the text and the full DOI citation in the references section e.g. '(Haxton et al. 2012)' in the text and&nbsp;'Haxton, T., Crooks, S., Jackson, C.R., Barkwith, A.K.A.P., Kelvin, J., Williamson, J., Mackay, J.D., Wang, L., Davies, H., Young, A., Prudhomme, C.

The Climoor field site is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increase temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots(July to September annually). We have measured a range of key community characteristics and processes (ranging from plant diversity to rates of soil respiration) since the experiment began in 1998. In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain). Detailed descriptions of the site (including both vegetation and soil) and treatments are included in the supporting information as well as the methods used, and it is vital that this is considered when re-using this data. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Coordinate reference systems</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Elevation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Climate change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heathland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drought</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>warming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calluna</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vaccinium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Empetrum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>automated roof technology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>shrubland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Clocaenog Forest</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ruthin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NE Wales.</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere-vegetation-soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biweekly to annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03637 Task 11</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03012NEU Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02613 Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03425 Task 9</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02639 Task 2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01735NEW</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-26T14:42:39Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7a5cfd3e-0247-4228-873d-5be563c4ee3b\">     <title>Post Chernobyl surveys of radiocaesium in soil, vegetation, wildlife and fungi in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7a5cfd3e-0247-4228-873d-5be563c4ee3b</link>     <description>Data comprise radiocaesium concentrations in soil, vegetation, wildlife and fungi analysed from samples collected from throughout Great Britain after the 1986 Chernobyl accident by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), formerly the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE).

The data are suitable for interpolation to create spatially variable surfaces suitable for input into models.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chernobyl</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deposition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>accident</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radiocaesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>North Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Yorkshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>GB</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fungi</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wildlife</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grasses</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heather</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pollution &amp; Environmental Risk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-25T09:02:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/fc65177d-b113-420e-a70b-05d3f42682d5\">     <title>Countryside Survey 2007 mapped estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/fc65177d-b113-420e-a70b-05d3f42682d5</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 2007 in a vector format. The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 591 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths per 1km square for 7 different feature categories within 45 different Land Class types, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.  The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Biodiversity_Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring and Observation Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-24T10:23:36Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e687330b-a0f7-45a1-b58c-398e67da3028\">     <title>Countryside Survey 2007 estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e687330b-a0f7-45a1-b58c-398e67da3028</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 2007.

Water samples were collected from the ecosystem of a Sitka spruce plantation at weekly intervals for six years.  The drainage system of the site had been designed to divide the plantation into a series of artificial catchments, three of which were designated experimental plots and clearfelled in the second year of sampling while three others were the control plots which remained unfelled until the end of the study.  This work formed part of a programme of field and laboratory work to determine the effects of felling plantation forest on soil processes.  Samples were collected by staff from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) between 1981 and 1987. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>clear felling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>clearcutting</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conifers</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sitka spruce</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil processes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cumbria</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>forestry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drainage water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>forests</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-29T15:17:43Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/73a7ae36-2882-434f-a206-76b848e22d82\">     <title>Total alkalinity data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/73a7ae36-2882-434f-a206-76b848e22d82</link>     <description>Discrete total alkalinity data for 13 sites in the Humber catchment sampled within the period 1993 to 1997 and 1996 to 1997 and for 3 sites from the Tweed catchment over the period 1994 to 1997, as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS).
