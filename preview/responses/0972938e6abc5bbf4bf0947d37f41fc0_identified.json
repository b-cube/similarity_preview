Modern land surface models require a characterisation of the land surface hydrological regime and this parameter allows the use of the TOPMODEL hydrological model to achieve this .This Geographic Information System layer is intended for use as topographic ancillary files for the TOPMODEL routing model option within the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. The topographic index variable here is directly comparable to the compound topographic index available from United States Geological Survey's Hydro1K at 30 sec resolution.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey in each of those years, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as the estimated mean length of linear features (hedgerows, walls, fences, banks, grass strips and tree lines) per 1km square within 45 different Land Class types based on the ITE Land Classification.  The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedgerows</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-10T14:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d774f98f-030d-45bb-8042-7729573a13b2\">     <title>Biodiversity, environmental and social data 2007-2008 for the project Improving the Success of Agri-environment Schemes (FarmCAT)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/d774f98f-030d-45bb-8042-7729573a13b2</link>     <description>This dataset consists of butterfly and bumblebee counts, winter bird counts, number of flowering units, and seed mass data, along with categories of soil type and quality, and temperature data. Data were collected from arable farms under the English Entry Level agri-environment Scheme (ELS) for two options: Nectar Flower Mixture option (NFM) and Wild Bird Seed Mixture (WBM). Surveys were carried out in 2007 and repeated in 2008. All data were collected using standardised protocols: butterfly and bumblebee counts were collected from transects in the NFM options during summer; flowering units were counted within quadrats along the same transects in summer; bird counts were made in winter within the whole WBM areas; seed resource was calculated for the WBM areas from seeds collected in quadrats along transects.  The dataset also contains results from farmer interviews. The interviews were designed to explore farmer attitudes towards, and history of, environmental management and their perceptions and understanding of the management requirements. Three measures of farmer attitude were then calculcated from their responses: experience (4-point scale), concerns (5-point scale) and motivation (3-point scale).  All data were collected as part of the FarmCAT project, the principal aim of which was to develop a holistic understanding of the social and ecological factors which lead to the successful delivery of agri-environmental schemes. This project was funded as part of the ESRC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter birds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bumblebees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>flowers</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>seeds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>agri-environment schemes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>AES</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nectar Flower Mixture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EF4</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wild Bird Seed Mixture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EF2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>environmental management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-06T15:36:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/0c5c5e20-246e-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Soil, vegetation and geology maps of the Moor House National Nature Reserve WMS</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/0c5c5e20-246e-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>Map service of soil types, geology and vegetation in the Moor House region of the Moor House - Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve.

Treatments were elevated ozone (AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone Threshold exposure of 40 parts per billion) of 12.86 ppm h) or control conditions (AOT40 of 0.02 ppm h). Measurements were dry weight, with a cutting height of 7cm above soil level. The distribution of plant material within the canopy was determined by separating material growing in the upper canopy (&gt;14cm) from the canopy edge and the inner canopy for both species. The experiments were carried out in the CEH Bangor Air Pollution Facility. Work was funded by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Integrating Fund Initiative. The observed decreases in photosynthetic efficiency and capacity in elevated ozone indicate that the ability of such ubiquitous vegetation to act as a sink for atmospheric carbon may be reduced in future climates.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dave Norris</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Solar Domes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Abergwyngregyn</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>solardome</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ozone</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>root</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>leaf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>competition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pollution &amp; Environmental Risk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-18T14:47:06Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/4af5abe4-158a-4736-b318-ec660e09e45a\">     <title>Countryside Survey mapped estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1990 and 2007</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/4af5abe4-158a-4736-b318-ec660e09e45a</link>     <description>This dataset consists of change data for areas of Broad Habitats across Great Britain between 1990 and 2007.

Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-04T14:14:07Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/271d398c-29de-4ff9-ba68-1b8e0621c6ee\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1984 estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/271d398c-29de-4ff9-ba68-1b8e0621c6ee</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1984.

Tick sampling data (91 files, each representing a day of sampling) indicate tick abundance (distinguishing larvae, nymphs, adult males and adult females), vegetation height, soil moisture, temperature and relative humidity.  Static risk map files indicate modeled tick abundance: 251 landcover files for the three sites, as well as 36 ArcView map files.  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  Many people take pleasure from activities in forests and wild lands in the UK and others are being encouraged to participate. Unfortunately, there are risks and one of the most insidious is the possibility (albeit tiny) of acquiring a disease from wild animals; for example, ticks can be vectors of the bacterial infection leading to Lyme Disease. Both diagnosis and treatment can be problematic so prevention of acquiring such disease is highly desirable.  Surprisingly little is known about how best to warn countryside users about the potential for disease without scaring them away or spoiling their enjoyment. Answering such questions was the goal of this project, and required the integration of a diverse set of scientific skills, and an understanding of the views of those who manage countryside, those who have contracted zoonotic diseases and those who access the land.  This project combined knowledge from three strands of work, namely risk assessment, risk perception and communication, and scenario analysis. The study sites were selected to provide a range of environmental conditions and countryside use. Peri-urban parkland, accessible lowland forest and heath and remote upland forest were chosen as represented by Richmond Park on the fringe of Greater London, the New Forest in Southern England, and Exmoor in South West England.  The following additional data from this same research project are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6892 (see online resources): Lyme disease risk perception data resulting from tick imagery vignette experiments, Lyme disease patient interviews and surveys, residents and countryside staff focus groups, forest manager interviews, and multiple scoring procedures of animal social representation; as well as Lyme and tick risk communication data resulting from interviews with organisations and content analysis of risk warning information leaflets,  Further documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal and the project's ESRC funding award web page (see online resources).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Rick Stuart</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Human health and safety</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rural Economy and Land Use Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Assessing and communicating animal disease risks for countryside users</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>health risks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>leisure time activities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>lyme disease</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>national parks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>nature reserves</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tourism</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>zoonotic diseases</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDS</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-25T13:14:24Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/cc264d08-ba89-42f0-a7cf-9c9477e1e2bd\">     <title>Measurements of respiration and microbial assimilation of carbon substrates and priming of soil organic matter mineralisation in tropical lowland and montane forest soils</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/cc264d08-ba89-42f0-a7cf-9c9477e1e2bd</link>     <description>This dataset includes measurements of microbial community composition by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, soil respiration (Carbon dioxide (CO2)), soil physico-chemical properties and 13C enrichment in CO2 samples and microbial Phospholipid Fatty Acids (PLFAs).

The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  A move to organic farming can have significant effects on wildlife, soil and water quality, as well as changing the ways in which food is supplied, the economics of farm business and indeed the attitudes of farmers themselves. Two key questions were addressed in the SCALE project: what causes organic farms to be arranged in clusters at local, regional and national scales, rather than be spread more evenly throughout the landscape; and how do the ecological, hydrological, socio-economic and cultural impacts of organic farming vary due to neighbourhood effects at a variety of scales.  The research was undertaken in 2006-2007 in two study sites: one in the English Midlands, and one in southern England. Both are sites in which organic farming has a `strong? local presence, which we defined as 10 per cent or more organically managed land within a 10 km radius. Potential organic farms were identified through membership lists of organic farmers provided by two certification bodies (the Soil Association and the Organic Farmers and Growers). Most who were currently farming (i.e. their listing was not out of date) agreed to participate. Conventional farms were identified through telephone listings.   Respondents? farms ranged in size from 40 to 3000 acres, with the majority farming between 100 and 1000 acres. Most were mixed crop-livestock farmers, with dairy most common in the southern site, and beef and/or sheep mixed with arable in the Midlands. In total, 48 farms were studied, of which 21 were organic farmers. No respondent had converted from organic to conventional production, whereas 17 had converted from conventional to organic farming. Twelve of the conventional farmers defined themselves as practicing low input agriculture.   Farmer interview data from this study are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6761 (see online resources).
