This causes       the number of RTCP reception reports to grow with the number of SSRCs,       rather than the number of endpoints. In many cases most of these RTCP       reception reports are unnecessary, since all SSRCs of an endpoint are       co-located and see the same reception quality. This memo defines a       Reporting Group extension to RTCP to reduce the reporting overhead in       such scenarios.</t>     </abstract>   </front>    <middle>     <section anchor=\"introduction\" title=\"Introduction\">       <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/> is a       protocol for group communication, supporting multiparty multimedia       sessions. A single RTP session can support multiple participants sending       at once, and can also support participants sending multiple simultaneous       media streams. Examples of the latter might include a participant with       multiple cameras who chooses to send multiple views of a scene, or a       participant that sends audio and video flows multiplexed in a single RTP       session. Rules for handling RTP sessions containing multiple media       streams are described in <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/> with some       clarifications in <xref       target=\"I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream\"/>.</t>        <t>An RTP endpoint will have one or more synchronisation sources (SSRCs)       that send media streams. It will have at least one SSRC for each media       stream it sends, and might use multiple SSRCs when using <xref       target=\"RFC6190\">media scalability features</xref>, forward error       correction, <xref target=\"RFC4588\">RTP retransmission</xref>, or similar       mechanisms. An endpoint that is not sending any media streams, will have       at least one SSRC to use for reporting and any feedback messages. Each       SSRC has to send RTCP sender reports corresponding to the RTP packets it       sends, and receiver reports for traffic it receives. That is, every SSRC       will send RTCP packets to report on every other SSRC. This rule is       simple, but can be quite inefficient for endpoints that send large       numbers of media streams in a single RTP session. Consider a session       comprising ten participants, each sending three media streams with their       own SSRC. There will be 30 SSRCs in such an RTP session, and 30 RTCP       reception reports will be sent per reporting interval as each SSRC       reports on all the others. However, the three SSRCs comprising each       participant will almost certainly see identical reception quality, since       they are co-located. If there was a way to indicate that several SSRCs       are co-located, and see the same reception quality, then two-thirds of       those RTCP reports could be suppressed. This would allow the remaining       RTCP reports to be sent more often, while keeping within the same RTCP       bandwidth fraction.</t>        <t>This memo defines such an RTCP extension, RTCP Reporting Groups. This       extension is used to indicate the SSRCs that originate from the same       endpoint, and therefore have identical reception quality, hence allowing       the endpoints to suppress unnecessary RTCP reception quality       reports.</t>     </section>      <section title=\"Terminology\">       <t>The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",       \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref       target=\"RFC2119\"/>.</t>     </section>      <section anchor=\"reportgroups\" title=\"RTCP Reporting Groups\">       <t>An RTCP Reporting Group is a set of synchronization sources (SSRCs)       that are co-located at a single endpoint (which could be an end host or       a middlebox) in an RTP session. Since they are co-located, every SSRC in       the RTCP reporting group will have an identical view of the network       conditions, and see the same lost packets, jitter, etc. This allows a       single representative to send RTCP reception quality reports on behalf       of the rest of the reporting group, reducing the number of RTCP packets       that need to be sent without loss of information.</t>        <section title=\"Semantics and Behaviour of RTCP Reporting Groups\">         <t>A group of co-located SSRCs that see identical network conditions         can form an RTCP reporting group. If reporting groups are in use, an         RTP endpoint with multiple SSRCs MAY put those SSRCs into a reporting         group if their view of the network is identical; i.e., if they report         on traffic received at the same interface of an RTP endpoint. SSRCs         with different views of the network MUST NOT be put into the same         reporting group.</t>          <t>An endpoint that has combined its SSRCs into an RTCP reporting         group will choose one (or a subset) of those SSRCs as a \"reporting         source\" for that RTCP reporting group. A reporting source will send         RTCP SR/RR reception quality reports on behalf of the other members of         the RTCP reporting group. A reporting source MUST suppress the RTCP         SR/RR reports that relate to other members of the reporting group, and         only report on remote SSRCs. The other members (non reporting sources)         of the RTCP reporting group will suppress their RTCP reception quality         reports, and instead send an RTCP RGRS packet (see <xref         target=\"sec-rgrs\"/>) to indicate that they are part of an RTCP         reporting group and give the SSRCs of the reporting sources.</t>          <t>If there are large numbers of remote SSRCs in the RTP session, then         the reception quality reports generated by the reporting source might         grow too large to fit into a single compound RTCP packet, forcing the         reporting source to use a round-robin policy to determine what remote         SSRCs it includes in each compound RTCP packet, and so reducing the         frequency of reports on each SSRC. To avoid this, in sessions with         large numbers of remote SSRCs, an RTCP reporting group MAY use more         than one reporting source. If several SSRCs are acting as reporting         sources for an RTCP reporting group, then each reporting source MUST         have non-overlapping sets of remote SSRCs it reports on.</t>          <t>An endpoint SHOULD NOT create an RTCP reporting group that         comprises only a single local SSRC (i.e., an RTCP reporting group         where the reporting source is the only member of the group), unless it         is anticipated that the group might have additional SSRCs added to it         in the future.</t>          <t>If a reporting source leaves the RTP session (i.e., if it sends a         RTCP BYE packet, or leaves the session without sending BYE under the         rules of <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/> section 6.3.7), the remaining         members of the RTCP reporting group MUST either (a) have another         reporting source, if existing, report on the remote SSRCs the leaving         SSRC reported on, (b) choose a new reporting source, or (c) disband         the RTCP reporting group and begin sending reception quality reports         following <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/> and <xref         target=\"I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream\"/>.</t>          <t>The RTCP timing rules assign different bandwidth fractions to         senders and receivers. This lets senders transmit RTCP reception         quality reports more often than receivers. If a reporting source in an         RTCP reporting group is a receiver, but one or more non-reporting         SSRCs in the RTCP reporting group are senders, then the endpoint MAY         treat the reporting source as a sender for the purpose of RTCP         bandwidth allocation, increasing its RTCP bandwidth allocation,         provided it also treats one of the senders as if it were a receiver         and makes the corresponding reduction in RTCP bandwidth for that SSRC.         However, the application needs to consider the impact on the frequency          of transmitting of the synchronization information included in RTCP         Sender Reports. </t>       </section>        <section title=\"Identifying Members of an RTCP Reporting Group\">         <t>When RTCP Reporting Groups are in use, the other SSRCs in the RTP         session need to be able to identify which SSRCs are members of an RTCP         reporting group. Two RTCP extensions are defined to support this: the         RTCP RGRP SDES item is used by the reporting source(s) to identify an         RTCP reporting group, and the RTCP RGRS packet is used by other         members of an RTCP reporting group to identify the reporting         source(s).</t>          <section anchor=\"sec-rgrp\"                  title=\"Definition and Use of the RTCP RGRP SDES Item\">           <t>A new RTCP SDES item is defined to identify an RTCP reporting           group. The motivation for giving a reporting group an identify is to           ensure that the RTCP reporting group and its member SSRCs can be           correctly associated when there are multiple reporting sources, and           to ensure that a reporting SSRC can be associated with the correct           reporting group if an SSRC collision occurs.</t>            <t>The RTCP Source Description (SDES) RGRP item is defined. The RTCP           SDES RGRP item MUST be sent by the reporting sources in a reporting           group, and MUST NOT be sent by other members of the reporting group           or by SSRCs that are not members of any RTCP reporting group.           Specifically, every reporting source in an RTCP reporting group MUST           include an RTCP SDES packet containing an RGRP item in every           compound RTCP packet in which it sends an RR or SR packet (i.e., in           every RTCP packet it sends, unless <xref           target=\"RFC5506\">Reduced-Size RTCP</xref> is in use).</t>            <t>Syntactically, the format of the RTCP SDES RGRP item is identical           to that of the <xref target=\"RFC7022\">RTCP SDES CNAME item</xref>,           except that the SDES item type field MUST have value RGRP=(TBA)           instead of CNAME=1. The value of the RTCP SDES RGRP item MUST be           chosen with the same concerns about global uniqueness and the same           privacy considerations as the RTCP SDES CNAME them. The value of the           RTCP SDES RGRP item MUST be stable throughout the lifetime of the           reporting group, even if the some or all of the reporting sources           change their SSRC due to collisions, or if the set of reporting           sources changes.</t>            <t><list style=\"empty\">               <t>Note to RFC Editor: please replace (TBA) in the above               paragraph with the RTCP SDES item type number assigned to the               RGRP item, then delete this note.</t>             </list></t>            <t>An RTP mixer or translator that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets           from members of a reporting group MUST forward the corresponding           RTCP SDES RGRP items as well, even if it otherwise strips SDES items           other than the CNAME item.</t>         </section>          <section anchor=\"sec-rgrs\"                  title=\"Definition and Use of the RTCP RGRS Packet\">           <t>A new RTCP packet type is defined to allow the members of an RTCP           reporting group to identify the reporting sources for that group.           This allows participants in an RTP session to distinguish an SSRC           that is sending empty RTCP reception reports because it is a member           of an RTCP reporting group, from an SSRC that is sending empty RTCP           reception reports because it is not receiving any traffic. It also           explicitly identifies the reporting sources, allowing other members           of the RTP session to know which SSRCs are acting as the reporting           sources for an RTCP reporting group, and allowing them to detect if           RTCP packets from any of the reporting sources are being lost.</t>            <t>The format of the RTCP RGRS packet is defined below.

If use of the RTP/AVPF profile has been negotiated in an RTP         session, members of an RTCP reporting group can send rapid RTCP         feedback and codec control messages following <xref target=\"RFC4585\"/>         and <xref target=\"RFC5104\"/>, as updated by Section 5.4 of <xref         target=\"I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream\"/>, and by the following         considerations.</t>          <t>The members of an RTCP reporting group will all see identical         network conditions. Accordingly, one might therefore think that it         doesn't matter which SSRC in the reporting group sends the RTP/AVPF         feedback or codec control messages. There might be, however, cases         where the sender of the feedback/codec control message has semantic         importance, or when only a subset of the members of an RTCP reporting         group might want to send RTP/AVPF feedback or a codec control message         in response to a particular event. For example, an RTP video sender         might choose to treat packet loss feedback received from SSRCs known         to be audio receivers with less urgency than feedback that it receives         from video receivers when deciding what packets to retransmit, and a         multimedia receiver using reporting groups might want to chose the         outgoing SSRC for feedback packets to reflect this.</t>          <t>Each member of an RTCP reporting group SHOULD therefore send         RTP/AVPF feedback/codec control messages independently of the other         members of the reporting group, to respect the semantic meaning of the         message sender. The suppression rules of <xref target=\"RFC4585\"/> will         ensure that only a single copy of each feedback packet is (typically)         generated, even if several members of a reporting group send the same         feedback. When an endpoint knows that several members of its RTCP         reporting group will be sending identical feedback, and that the         sender of the feedback is not semantically important, then that         endpoint MAY choose to send all its feedback from the reporting source         and deterministically suppress feedback packets generated by the other         sources in the reporting group.</t>          <t>It is important to note that the RTP/AVPF timing rules operate on a         per-SSRC basis. Using a single reporting source to send all feedback         for a reporting group will hence limit the amount of feedback that can         be sent to that which can be sent by one SSRC. If this limit is a         problem, then the reporting group can allow each of its members to         send its own feedback, using its own SSRC.</t>          <t>If the RTP/AVPF feedback messages or codec control requests are         sent as compound RTCP packets, then those compound RTCP packets MUST         include either an RTCP RGRS packet or an RTCP SDES RGRP item,         depending on whether they are sent by the reporting source or a         non-reporting source in the RTCP reporting group respectively. The         contents of non-compound RTCP feedback or codec control messages are         not affected by the use of RTCP reporting groups.</t>       </section>        <section title=\"Interactions with RTCP Extended Report (XR) Packets\">         <t>When using RTCP Extended Reports (XR) <xref target=\"RFC3611\"/> with         RTCP reporting groups, it is RECOMMENDED that the reporting source is         used to send the RTCP XR packets. If multiple reporting sources are in         use, the reporting source that sends the SR/RR packets that relate to         a particular remote SSRC SHOULD send the RTCP XR reports about that         SSRC. This is motivated as one commonly combine the RTCP XR metrics         with the regular report block to more fully understand the situation.         Receiving these blocks in different compound packets reduces their         value as the measuring intervals are not synchronized in those         cases.</t>          <t>Some RTCP XR report blocks are specific to particular types of         media, and might be relevant to only some members of a reporting         group. For example, it would make no sense for an SSRC that is         receiving video to send a VoIP metric RTCP XR report block. Such media         specific RTCP XR report blocks MUST be sent by the SSRC to which they         are relevant, and MUST NOT be included in the common report sent by         the reporting source. This might mean that some SSRCs send RTCP XR         packets in compound RTCP packets that contain an empty RTCP SR/RR         packet, and that the time period covered by the RTCP XR packet is         different to that covered by the RTCP SR/RR packet. If it is important         that the RTCP XR packet and RTCP SR/RR packet cover the same time         period, then that source SHOULD be removed from the RTCP reporting         group, and send standard RTCP packets instead.</t>       </section>        <section title=\"Middlebox Considerations\">         <t>Many different types of middlebox are used with RTP. RTCP reporting         groups are potentially relevant to those types of RTP middlebox that         have their own SSRCs and generate RTCP reports for the traffic they         receive. RTP middleboxes that do not have their own SSRC, and that         don't send RTCP reports on the traffic they receive, cannot use the         RTCP reporting groups extension, since they generate no RTCP reports         to group.</t>          <t>An RTP middlebox that has several SSRCs of its own can use the RTCP         reporting groups extension to group the RTCP reports it generates.         This can occur, for example, if a middlebox is acting as an RTP mixer         for both audio and video flows that are multiplexed onto a single RTP         session, where the middlebox has one SSRC for the audio mixer and one         for the video mixer part, and when the middlebox wants to avoid cross         reporting between audio and video.</t>          <t>A middlebox cannot use the RTCP reporting groups extension to group         RTCP packets from the SSRCs that it is forwarding. It can, however,         group the RTCP packets from the SSRCs it is forwarding into compound         RTCP packets following the rules in Section 6.1 of <xref         target=\"RFC3550\"/> and Section 5.3 of <xref         target=\"I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream\"/>. If the middlebox is         using RTCP reporting groups for its own SSRCs, it MAY include RTCP         packets from the SSRCs that it is forwarding as part of the compound         RTCP packets its reporting source generates.</t>          <t>A middlebox that forwards RTCP SR or RR packets sent by members of         a reporting group MUST forward the corresponding RTCP SDES RGRP items,         as described in <xref target=\"sec-rgrp\"/>. A middlebox that forwards         RTCP SR or RR packets sent by member of a reporting group MUST also         forward the corresponding RTCP RGRS packets, as described in <xref         target=\"sec-rgrs\"/>. Failure to forward these packets can cause         compatibility problems, as described in <xref target=\"compat\"/>.</t>          <t>If a middlebox rewrites SSRC values in the RTP and RTCP packets         that it is forwarding, then it MUST make the corresponding changes in         RTCP SDES packets containing RGRP items and in RTCP RGRS packets, to         allow them to be associated with the rewritten SSRCs.</t>       </section>        <section anchor=\"sdp\" title=\"SDP Signalling for Reporting Groups\">         <t>This document defines the \"a=rtcp-rgrp\" <xref         target=\"RFC4566\">Session Description Protocol (SDP)</xref> attribute         to indicate if the session participant is capable of supporting RTCP         Reporting Groups for applications that use SDP for configuration of         RTP sessions. The attribute takes no value. A participant that         proposes the use of RTCP Reporting Groups SHALL itself support the         reception of RTCP Reporting Groups.</t>          <t>An offering client that wishes to use RTCP Reporting Groups MUST         include the attribute \"a=rtcp-rgrp\" in the SDP offer. If \"a=rtcp-rgrp\"         is present in the offer SDP, the answerer that supports RTCP Reporting         Groups and wishes to use it SHALL include the \"a=rtcp-rgrp\" attribute         in the answer. In cases the answer has been excluded, neither agents         SHALL use the RTCP Reporting Groups.</t>          <t>In declarative usage of SDP, such as the <xref         target=\"RFC2326\">Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)</xref> and the         <xref target=\"RFC2974\">Session Announcement Protocol (SAP)</xref>, the         presence of the attribute indicates that the session participant MAY         use RTCP Reporting Groups in its RTCP transmissions. An implementation         that doesn't explicitly support RTCP Reporting Groups MAY join a RTP         session as long as it has been verified that the implementation         doesn't suffer from the problems discussed in <xref         target=\"compat\"/>.</t>       </section>     </section>      <section title=\"Properties of RTCP Reporting Groups\">       <t>This section provides additional information on what the resulting       properties are with the design specified in <xref       target=\"reportgroups\"/>. The content of this section is       non-normative.</t>        <section anchor=\"reportgroups-bw\"                title=\"Bandwidth Benefits of RTCP Reporting Groups\">         <t>To understand the benefits of RTCP reporting groups, consider a         scenario in which the two endpoints in a session each have a hundred         sources, of which eight each are sending within any given reporting         interval.</t>          <t>For ease of analysis, we can make the simplifying approximation         that the duration of the RTCP reporting interval is equal to the total         size of the RTCP packets sent during an RTCP interval, divided by the         RTCP bandwidth. (This will be approximately true in scenarios where         the bandwidth is not so high that the minimum RTCP interval is         reached.) For further simplification, we can assume RTCP senders are         following the recommendations regarding Compound RTCP Packets in <xref         target=\"I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream\"/>; thus, the per-packet         transport-layer overhead will be small relative to the RTCP data.         Thus, only the actual RTCP data itself need be considered.</t>          <t>In a report interval in this scenario, there will, as a baseline,         be 200 SDES packets, 184 RR packets, and 16 SR packets. This amounts         to approximately 6.5 kB of RTCP per report interval, assuming 16-byte         CNAMEs and no other SDES information.</t>          <t>Using the original <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/>         everyone-reports-on-every-sender feedback rules, each of the 184         receivers will send 16 report blocks, and each of the 16 senders will         send 15. This amounts to approximately 76 kB of report block traffic         per interval; 92% of RTCP traffic consists of report blocks.</t>          <t>If reporting groups are used, however, there is only 0.4 kB of         reports per interval, with no loss of useful information.         Additionally, there will be (assuming 16-byte RGRPs, and a single         reporting source per reporting group) an additional 2.4 kB per cycle         of RGRP SDES items and RGRS packets. Put another way, the unmodified         <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/> reporting interval is approximately 8.9 times         longer than if reporting groups are in use.</t>       </section>        <section anchor=\"compat\" title=\"Compatibility of RTCP Reporting Groups\">         <t>The RTCP traffic generated by receivers using RTCP Reporting Groups         might appear, to observers unaware of these semantics, to be generated         by receivers who are experiencing a network disconnection, as the         non-reporting sources appear not to be receiving a given sender at         all.</t>          <t>This could be a potentially critical problem for such a sender         using RTCP for congestion control, as such a sender might think that         it is sending so much traffic that it is causing complete congestion         collapse.</t>          <t>However, such an interpretation of the session statistics would         require a fairly sophisticated RTCP analysis. Any receiver of RTCP         statistics which is just interested in information about itself needs         to be prepared that any given reception report might not contain         information about a specific media source, because reception reports         in large conferences can be round-robined.</t>          <t>Thus, it is unclear to what extent such backward compatibility         issues would actually cause trouble in practice.</t>       </section>     </section>      <section title=\"Security Considerations\">       <t>The security considerations of <xref target=\"RFC3550\"/> and <xref       target=\"I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-multi-stream\"/> apply. If the RTP/AVPF       profile is in use, then the security considerations of <xref       target=\"RFC4585\"/> (and <xref target=\"RFC5104\"/>, if used) also apply.       If RTCP XR is used, the security consideration of <xref       target=\"RFC3611\"/> and any XR report blocks used also apply.</t>        <t>The RTCP SDES RGRP item is vulnerable to malicious modifications       unless integrity protected is used. A modification of this item's length       field cause the parsing of the RTCP packet in which it is contained to       fail. Depending on the implementation, parsing of the full compound RTCP       packet can also fail causing the whole packet to be discarded. A       modification to the value of this SDES item would make the receiver of       the report think that the sender of the report was a member of a       different RTCP reporting group. This will potentially create an       inconsistency, when the RGRS reports the source as being in the same       reporting group as another source with another reporting group       identifier. What impact on a receiver implementation such       inconsistencies would have are difficult to fully predict. One case is       when congestion control or other adaptation mechanisms are used, an       inconsistent report can result in a media sender to reduce its bit-rate.       However, a direct modification of the receiver report or a feedback       message itself would be a more efficient attack, and equally costly to       perform.</t>        <t>The new RGRS RTCP Packet type is very simple. The common RTCP packet       type header shares the security risks with previous RTCP packet types.       Errors or modification of the length field can cause the full compound       packet to fail header validation (see Appendix A.2 in <xref       target=\"RFC3550\"/>) resulting in the whole compound RTCP packet being       discarded. Modification of the SC or P fields would cause inconsistency       when processing the RTCP packet, likely resulting it being classified as       invalid. A modification of the PT field would cause the packet being       interpreted under some other packet type's rules. In such case the       result might be more or less predictable but packet type specific.       Modification of the SSRC of packet sender would attribute this packet to       another sender. Resulting in a receiver believing the reporting group       applies also for this SSRC, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, unless       also corresponding modifications are done on a SR/RR packet and a SDES       packet the RTCP packet SHOULD be discarded. If consistent changes are       done, that could be part of a resource exhaustion attack on a receiver       implementation. Modification of the \"List of SSRCs for the Reporting       Source(s)\" would change the SSRC the receiver expect to report on behalf       of this SSRC. If that SSRC exist, that could potentially change the       report group used for this SSRC. A change to another reporting group       belonging to another endpoint is likely detectable as there would be a       mismatch between the SSRC of the packet sender's endpoint information,       transport addresses, SDES CNAME etc and the corresponding information       from the reporting group indicated.</t>        <t>In general the reporting group is providing limited impacts attacks.       The most significant result from an deliberate attack would be to cause       the information to be discarded or be inconsistent, including discard of       all RTCP packets that are modified. This causes a lack of information at       any receiver entity, possibly disregarding the endpoints participation       in the session.</t>        <t>To protect against this type of attacks from external non trusted       entities, integrity and source authentication SHOULD be applied. This       can be done, for example, by using <xref target=\"RFC3711\">SRTP</xref>       with appropriate key-management, other options exist as discussed in       <xref target=\"RFC7201\">RTP Security Options</xref>.</t>        <t>The Report Group Identifier has a potential privacy impacting       properties. If this would be generated by an implementation in such a       way that is long term stable or predictable, it could be used for       tracking a particular end-point. Therefore it is RECOMMENDED that it be       generated as a short-term persistent RGRP, following the rules for       short-term persistent CNAMEs in <xref target=\"RFC7022\"/>. The rest of       the information revealed, i.e. the SSRCs, the size of reporting group       and the number of reporting sources in a reporting group is of less       sensitive nature, considering that the SSRCs and the communication would       anyway be revealed without this extension. By encrypting the report       group extensions the SSRC values would preserved confidential, but can       still be revealed if <xref target=\"RFC3711\">SRTP</xref> is used. The       size of the reporting groups and number of reporting sources are likely       determinable from analysis of the packet pattern and sizes. However,       this information appears to have limited value.</t>     </section>      <section title=\"IANA Considerations\">       <t>(Note to the RFC-Editor: in the following, please replace \"TBA\" with       the IANA-assigned value, and \"XXXX\" with the number of this document,       then delete this note)</t>        <t>The IANA is requested to register one new RTCP SDES items in the       \"RTCP SDES Item Types\" registry, as follows:</t>        <figure>         <artwork><![CDATA[    Value  Abbrev  Name                         Reference    TBA    RGRP    Reporting Group Identifier   [RFCXXXX]       ]]></artwork>       </figure>        <t>The definition of the RTCP SDES RGRP item is given in <xref       target=\"sec-rgrp\"/> of this memo.</t>        <t>The IANA is also requested to register one new RTCP packet type in       the \"RTCP Control Packet Types (PT)\" Registry as follows:</t>        <figure>         <artwork><![CDATA[    Value  Abbrev  Name                               Reference    TBA    RGRS    Reporting Group Reporting Sources  [RFCXXXX]       ]]></artwork>       </figure>        <t>The definition of the RTCP RGRS packet type is given in <xref       target=\"sec-rgrs\"/> of this memo.</t>        <t>The IANA is also requested to register one new SDP attribute:</t>        <figure>         <artwork><![CDATA[    SDP Attribute (\"att-field\"):       Attribute name:     rtcp-rgrp       Long form:          RTCP Reporting Groups       Type of name:       att-field       Type of attribute:  Media or session level       Subject to charset: No       Purpose:            Negotiate or configure the use of the RTCP                            Reporting Group Extension.
