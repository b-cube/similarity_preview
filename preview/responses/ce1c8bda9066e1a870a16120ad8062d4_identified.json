Getting enough of the right kind of food affects cellular function and energy acquisition, disease avoidance, mate attraction, trophic interactions and hence ecosystem structure. When nutritional needs are inadequately met, fecundity and survival can be adversely affected. However, the severity of these effects, and the importance of the particular life history stage when they were experienced, is incompletely understood. Understanding how and when nutritional conditions affect fitness is particularly important for the conservation of endangered species, especially when food supplementation is a key part of managing the few populations that remain. In this thesis, I explore the importance of nutrition during early- and adult-life for the hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a colourful, sexually dichromatic endangered New Zealand passerine.&#13; &#13; I begin by investigating the importance of nestling nutritional environment for the expression of colourful plumage in adulthood. By experimentally supplementing nestlings with alternative dietary treatments, I demonstrate that early life nutritional conditions have long-term consequences for the expression of both carotenoid-based and structurally produced plumage features. Next I investigate whether these colourful plumage traits are sexually selected. I show that different components of a male\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds colourful plumage, including yellow carotenoid-based, black melanin-based and white structurally-based colour, are relevant for different aspects of reproductive success. Using the dietary supplementation experiment, I also consider the impact of alternative supplementary foods on the growth and subsequent survival of hihi. I show that directly supplementing nestlings with protein has a negligible long-term survival benefit over supplementing carbohydrates, and present evidence that males and females have divergent nutritional needs during development \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd an important consideration for any supplementary feeding program. Finally, I consider whether moulting male hihi selectively forage for carotenoid-rich foods in the wild, as would be expected in a species that requires these pigments for sexual display. I present evidence that adult male hihi do indeed target carotenoid-rich foods during moult, which is consistent with the suggestion that dietary carotenoid access maintains signal honesty.&#13; &#13; In short, by addressing evolutionary questions from a nutritional perspective, I discover how and when investment in key life history traits is prioritised, how this differs between the sexes and show how this knowledge might be used in supplementary feeding programs to the benefit of endangered species. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246227\"> <title>On the origin and spread of horse domestication</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246227</link> <description>On the origin and spread of horse domestication Warmuth, Vera For several decades, the origin of domestic horses has been the focus of research across multiple disciplines, yet many aspects of the horse domestication process remain poorly understood. One of the reasons for the difficulty in establishing a coherent scenario of horse domestication is that archaeological, mtDNA, and Y chromosome data have yielded ambiguous results, possibly because each class of markers reflects different aspects of the domestication process. In this thesis, I use large autosomal genetic datasets from horses sampled across Eurasia to investigate the origin and spread of horse domestication.&#13; I begin by characterising genetic diversity of horses from the Eurasian steppes and neighbouring regions, thus laying the groundwork for a more thorough analysis into the demographic history of horses. I then investigate the origin and mode of spread of horse domestication in the Eurasian steppe region using a spatially explicit genetic model. I show that horse domestication was initiated in the western part of the steppes, and that the spread of horse domestication involved both movement of domestic herds and extensive recruitment of wild horses from across this vast region, a scenario which integrates both archaeological and molecular evidence. Having established the route of spread of early domestic horses out of their domestication origin in the western steppe, I go on to investigate the routes and levels of gene flow among Eastern Eurasian horse populations post-domestication. I show that the ancient Silk Roads have played an important role in shaping the genetic structure of Eastern Eurasian horses, facilitating gene flow across deserts and high mountain chains. Finally, I provide further compelling evidence for the persistence of wild horses in the Iberian Peninsula throughout the Holocene period, and the substantial contribution of these local populations to the gene pool of Iberian domestic horses. Together, my results provide a coherent picture of the origin and spread of horse domestication, integrating for the first time previous evidence from archaeology, mtDNA and Y chromosome sequence data. </description> <dc:date>2012-04-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245526\"> <title>Maternal investment tactics in cooperative breeding systems</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245526</link> <description>Maternal investment tactics in cooperative breeding systems Savage, James L. Whenever multiple individuals contribute to the care of offspring, the optimum level of investment for each carer depends on the behaviour of the others. Previous theoretical and empirical work has largely focused on carer contributions within a single stage of a breeding attempt, neglecting the potential for investment during earlier stages to influence later care decisions. Typically, mothers have much greater control than other carers over the number and quality of offspring, and hence by altering her investment during offspring production a mother can adaptively adjust offspring phenotype to match or exploit the predicted care paradigm. In this dissertation, I use theoretical, empirical and comparative methods to investigate the influence of maternal tactics on investment rules in cooperative breeding systems, where \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhelpers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd care in addition to parents. In three chapters I model maternal control of offspring quality and offspring number across a cooperative breeding attempt, and investigate how the costliness of different reproductive stages, the kin-structure of the care group, and the consequences of offspring early-life condition influence the investment rules of carers. During offspring rearing, fair division of labour within a cooperative group can theoretically be resolved using simple turn-taking rules, leading to efficient outcomes for all carers. To test whether such a rule is employed in nature, a later chapter analyses empirical provisioning data from the chestnut-crowned babbler  (Pomatostomus ruficeps), a cooperatively breeding bird endemic to the Australian outback. I use a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to determine whether individuals alter their provisioning rate when other carers visit the nest, and identify both \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpassive\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdactive\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd turn-taking behaviour. Finally, I present a comparative analysis of studies on provisioning rules in cooperatively breeding birds, and investigate whether the level of investment mothers must contribute to offspring influences the later care paradigm observed. My results indicate that maternal costs contribute to variation in both breeding group size and female provisioning behaviour. I conclude that maternal investment tactics are an underappreciated influence on carer investment rules in&#13; both the theoretical and empirical literature, and that incorporating them is crucial to understanding variation in cooperative care behaviour in nature. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245197\"> <title>Land use, food production, and the future of tropical forest species in Ghana</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245197</link> <description>Land use, food production, and the future of tropical forest species in Ghana Phalan, Benjamin Timothy Agriculture is arguably the greatest threat to tropical forest species. Conservation scientists disagree over the relative importance of two opposing strategies for minimising this threat: enhancing on-farm biodiversity, through wildlife-friendly farming practices, or sparing land for nature by using high-yielding farming methods on the smallest possible area to reduce the need to convert natural habitats. Previous theoretical work shows that understanding the relationship between population density and yield for individual species is crucial for determining whether one of these strategies, or a mixed strategy, will maximise their populations for a given food production target.&#13; &#13; In this thesis, I aim to identify what land-use strategy will permit increases in food production with least impact on species in the forest zone of Ghana. Farm-fallow mosaic landscapes with shifting cultivation and native canopy trees produced only around 15% as much food energy per hectare as the highest-yielding oil palm plantations. In farm mosaics where perennial tree crops dominate, food production and profits were higher, but did not reach those of oil palm plantations. I surveyed birds and trees in forest, farm mosaic, and oil palm plantation, and combined these data with information on yields to assess the likely consequences of plausible future scenarios of land-use change. My results provide evidence of a strong trade-off between wildlife value and agricultural yield. Species richness was high in low-yielding farming systems, but there was considerable turnover between these systems and forests, with widespread generalists replacing narrowly endemic forest-dependent species. Species most dependent on forest as a natural habitat, those with smaller global ranges and those of conservation concern showed least tolerance of habitat modification. For virtually all species, including even widespread generalists, future land-use strategies based on land sparing are likely to support higher populations of most species and minimise their risk of extinction compared to land-use strategies based on wildlife-friendly farming.&#13; &#13; If food production is to increase in line with Ghana\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds population growth, a combination of efforts to improve forest protection and to increase yields on current farmed land is likely to achieve this at least cost to forest species. Efforts to better protect forests, which require further restrictions on human use, might be most effective if they can be closely linked to support for farmers to improve their yields. In the long term however, this strategy will only delay and not avert biodiversity loss, unless global society can limit its consumption. </description> <dc:date>2010-07-06T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
