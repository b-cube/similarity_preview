In sport accurate predictions of other persons\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd movements are essential. Former studies have shown that predictions can be enhanced by mapping movements onto sound (sonification) and providing audiovisual feedback [1]. The present study investigated behavioral mechanisms of movement sonification and scrutinized whether effects of own movements and those of other persons can be predicted just by listening to them. Eight athletes heard sonifications of an indoor rower and quantified resulting velocities of a virtual boat. Although boat velocity was not mapped onto sound directly, it explained subjects\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd quantifications by regression analysis (R2 = 0.80) significantly better than the directly sonified amplitude and force parameters. Thus perception of boat velocity might have emerged from those sonifications. Predictions of effects of unknown movements were above chance level and as good as predictions of own movements. Furthermore athletes were able to identify their own technique among others (d\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd = 0.47 \\ufffd\\ufffd 0.43). The results confirm large perceptual effects of auditory feedback and - most importantly - suggest that movement sonification can address central motor representations just by listening to it. Therefore not only predictability but also synchronization with other persons\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd movements might be supported.

The use of spatial music can be particularly appropriate to represent its contained patterns. The literature describes several research done on sonifying neuroimaging data as well as different techniques to use spatialization as a musical language. In this paper, we discuss an artistic approach to fMRI sonification exploiting new compositional paradigms in spatial music. There fore, we have consider the brain activity as audio base material of a the spatial musical composition. Our approach attempts to explore the aesthetic potential of brain sonification not by transforming the data beyond the recognizable, and presenting the data as direct as possible.

Because of the common fate effect of gestalt principle, correlated signals are perceived as a unity, while uncorrelated signals are perceived segregated. This method is first examined with sonification of simple, generic datasets. Then, harmonic mapping is applied to sonification of an ECoG data of an epileptic seizure episode. The relationship between the gestalt formation the correlation in the data across channels is discussed in detail using a 16 channels reduced dataset. Finally, sonification of a 56 channel ECoG dataset is provided to demonstrate the advantage of the harmonic mapping.
