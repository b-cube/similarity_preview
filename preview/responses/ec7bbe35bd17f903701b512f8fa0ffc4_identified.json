regulates hunting and trapping in California is considering a complete ban on bobcat trapping in the state, but two Northern California counties have a problem with that.</p>  <p>The California Fish and Game Commission has been considering banning all bobcat trapping in the state as a way of implementing a law, the <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewild/legislation/bobcat-placeholder.html\">Bobcat Protection Act of 2013 or AB1213</a>, which obligates the Commission to establish buffer zones around national and state parks and wildlife sanctuaries where bobcat trapping wouldn't be allowed.</p>  <p>But during its regular meeting in early December 2014, the Commission discussed the possibility of making those buffer zones as large as possible to encompass the entire state of California. A decision on that proposal is expected by this summer, and advocates of bobcat trapping aren't pleased.</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p>According to reporter David Smith in the <a href=\"http://www.siskiyoudaily.com/article/20150317/NEWS/150319727/2025/undefined\">Siskiyou Daily News</a>, the Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors has sent a letter to the Fish and Game Commission urging the Commission not to extend AB1213's ban on bobcat trapping statewide. The letter charges the Commission with overstepping its bounds in considering a statewide ban.</p>  <p>\"It appears that a recent effort coming before the [Commission] in their implementation [of] AB 1213,\" reads the Supervisors' letter to the Commission, \"is not only running afoul of the only practical way to manage bobcats (trapping), but is flying in the face of the legislative history, intent and language, not to mention the Governor's clearly articulated direction when he signed the bill into law.\"</p>  <p>The county in far northern California joins Humboldt County and the California Trappers' Association in opposing a statewide ban.</p>  <p>As <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/revisit/commentary/the-hidden-desert/why-california-should-ban-bobcat-trapping.html\">we reported in 2013</a>, previous regulations on the books governing trapping of bobcats were nearly indefensible from a scientific viewpoint. The nearly unrestricted bobcat trapping season ran from November 24 through January 31, and any Californian in possession of an easily obtained trappers' license could trap as many cats as he or she desired until a statewide total of 14,400 bobcats was reached for the season. </p>  <p>That statewide cap was based on the state's total estimated population of bobcats in the 1970s. A court found in 1982 that the science behind the late 1970s population estimate was flawed enough to be unsuitable as the basis for a bobcat management program. No surveys have been conducted since to get a better handle on the bobcat population in California, or even to find out whether the medium-sized predators are gaining or losing ground in the state.</p>  <p>According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, bobcat trappers and hunters took an estimated 1,639 cats in the 2013-14 season. Though that was an increase over the previous year, it was down substantially from the 1,813 cats taken in the 2011-12 season, the largest take of California bobcats in two decades.</p>  <p>Global fashion is driving the surge in bobcat trapping, as increased demand for cat furs from species not protected by international conservation laws has spiked the price for bobcat skins. In the 2013-14 season, pelt prices averaged $390.</p>  <p>It's that \"harvest\" of wild animals for personal profit in a volatile market that has fans of the wild cats pushing for a complete statewide ban. \"It's important to end bobcat trapping statewide in order to end the wanton taking, by a few individuals, of natural resources that belong to all Californians,\" wildlife activist Miriam Seger of Joshua Tree told KCET.</p>]]>     </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Glendale One Step Closer to a Fully Recreationaly Riverfront</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/river-notes/glendale-one-step-closer-to-a-full-riverfront-dedicated-to-recreation.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/socal/departures/lariver/confluence//1860.80823</id>      <published>2015-03-19T00:12:11Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-18T23:44:40Z</updated>      <summary>Glendale might soon be the first city in greater Los Angeles to dedicate all of its riverfront to recreation.

On March 3rd, the Glendale City council approved plans to enhance its <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/river-notes/phase-one-of-glendale-narrows-riverwalk-opens.html\">Glendale Riverwalk</a>  project, approving conceptual plans for two parks and two bridges on the Riverwalk, as well as permission to seek funding for further design and construction of the latter two bridges.</p>  <p>The current <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/river-notes/phase-one-of-glendale-narrows-riverwalk-opens.html\">Glendale Riverwalk</a> (Phase One of the project) opened to the public in December 2012. The project sits opposite Griffith Park and extends from Bette Davis Park on the west to Flower Street on the east. It offers half a mile of native landscaping, walking and bicycling trails, public art inspired by <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/river-notes/stop-motion-art-alights-on-the-glendale-narrows-spillway.html\">Stop Motion</a>, and even has Glendale's dedicated equestrian community in mind. A facility on Phase 1 allows horse-owners to exercise their steeds before heading out to Griffith Park.</p>  <p>Phase 2 of the project would complete the nearly one-mile Riverwalk and the remainder of the trail by building Flower Plaza on Flower Street and Fairmont Avenue, and Confluence Park by the Los Angeles River and Verdugo Wash further downstream. Flower Plaza would connect the bike path on either side of it and includes construction of a small bridge over the flood control box culvert. The resulting trail will be continuous from the Riverwalk Entry Park by Bette Davis Park, east past Dreamworks at the Flower and Fairmont intersection and then turning south to the Verdugo Wash by the 134 Freeway.</p>  <p><img alt=\"City of Glendale Narrows Riverwalk Project Bridge Design - Flower Plaza\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/FLOWERPLAZA.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>Both parks are set to be completed by 2016. \"Phase 2 completes the development of the greenway from stem to stern,\" says Glendale city engineer, Kevin Carter. </p>  <p>Funds for Phase 2 are already available. Carter shares that $975,000 of Proposition 84 funds are available to build the two parks, and another $425,000 from Measure R is reserved for construction on the culvert. Marc Stirdivant, Glendale's Senior Administrative Analyst for Community Services & Parks adds, \"Once we've completed Phase 2, Glendale will be the only city on the entire L.A. River to devote one hundred percent of its river frontage to recreation.\"</p>  <p>And what a vision the city has. Rather than become a throughway for Angelenos passing through, Glendale wants its Riverwalk to be a place to stop. \"We want to make gathering spots so people can come and hang out,\" says Stirdivant. </p>  <p>Simple changes like changing out a six-foot high chain link fence with a lower 42-inch wrought iron version, putting in stadium seating at Flower Plaza, and adding Adirondack chairs at Confluence Park are being planned. </p>  <p><img alt=\"City of Glendale Narrows Riverwalk Project Bridge Design - Confluence Park\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/Confluence_Park.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>In addition to completing the parks of Glendale Riverwalk, the city has also approved conceptual designs for two bridges that would increase the Riverwalk's connectivity to Los Angeles--Phase 3 of its Riverwalk project. Los Angeles River Bridge will connect the Riverwalk bikeway to the Los Angeles River bike trail adjacent to Griffith Park.  The Verdugo Wash Bridge will connect the Riverwalk to North Atwater. The exact location of the bridges has yet to be determined.</p>  <p>Phase 3 funding only covers design development, outreach, and project feasibility, however. The city still needs to find funds to actually build these bridges. \"Much of the purpose of this effort is to detail the potential bridge enough to submit for grant funding,\" says Carter. </p>  <p>About 200 residents came out to a series of workshops held by the city to help choose a conceptual design for the bridges. \"We're trying to improve connectivity of our trails with other trails,\" says Carter, \"One of the biggest ways to do that is by going across the river and connecting to Griffith Park.\"</p>  <p>At the workshops, residents overwhelmingly chose the Garden Bridge design out of a total of eight different alternatives. Three other runner-ups were also identified. Because the project isn't yet funded for construction, Glendale is quick to make clear that what is agreed during the workshops are only signposts to future possibilities. </p>  <p><img alt=\"City of Glendale Narrows Riverwalk Project Bridge Design - Winning Concept, Garden Bridge\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/Winning_Consept_GardenBridge.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>The winning Garden Bridge design is one that imagines a bridge as a destination, not just a means of getting from point A to point B. The bridge would have a winding S-shaped form, where its curves settle into shaded seating areas where residents can view the Los Angeles River and beyond. The seating would be a contemplative space separate from the fast-moving driving, walking and bicycle lanes. Construction costs are estimated to be between $10 and 15 million. </p>  <p>Other options, which may be considered, given the funding available, are a low-profiled arched bridge outfitted with solar panels, one that looks like it stands akimbo over the Los Angeles River in profile, and a simpler concrete truss. Designers say that the second, smaller Verdugo Wash bridge would be similar to Garden Bridge. </p>  <p><img alt=\"City of Glendale Narrows Riverwalk Project Bridge Design - Solar Arch Bridge\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/Solar_ArchBridge.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"City of Glendale Narrows Riverwalk Project Bridge Design - Concrete Truss Bridge\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/Concrete_TrussBridge.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"City of Glendale Narrows Riverwalk Project Bridge Design - Garden Bridge\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/lariver/confluence/GardenBridge_2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>\"Particularly in central and south Glendale, we have a large population living a park poor area, in many cases it's also an economically disadvantaged area.

But the last several years have been anything but typical: the ongoing drought has shrunk the state's reservoirs and cut the amount of hydro power the state can generate by about a third.</p>  <p>And since our consumption of energy hasn't dropped to make up the shortfall, says a <a href=\"http://pacinst.org/publication/impacts-of-californias-ongoing-drought-hydroelectricity-generation/\">report released this week by the Pacific Institute</a>, California has stepped up its consumption of power from plants that burn expensive, carbon-polluting natural gas to fill the gap left by the drought.</p>  <p>As a result, says the report, ratepayers are shelling out almost half a billion additional dollars per year, and emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from California power plants have risen significantly.</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p>The report, entitled \"Impacts of California's Ongoing Drought: Hydroelectricity Generation,\" also cites increased imports of out of state electricity (likely increasing the state's coal footprint) and more wind and solar as other ways in which the state's power managers have been dealing with the hydropower  shortfall.</p>  <p>\"This severe drought has many negative consequences. One of them that receives little attention is how the drought has fundamentally changed the way our electricity is produced,\" said the report's author, Pacific Institute President Peter Gleick. </p>  <p>The report's worth reading for its overview of California's in-state power generation as well. Our state is very much hooked on natural gas even in non-drought years, but as this Pacific Institute pie chart based on data from the California Energy Commission shows, the drier it gets the gassier our energy mix becomes:</p>  <div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewire/assets_c/2015/03/california-energy-graph-3-18-15-thumb-630x439-89713.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"439\"  class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">California's 2013 in-state power generation from various sources | Graph: <a href=\"http://pacinst.org/publication/impacts-of-californias-ongoing-drought-hydroelectricity-generation/\">Pacific Institute</a></div></div>  <p>Before you look at that razor-thin one percent of California's power mix filled by burning coal and start thinking our state was nearly coal-free in 2013, remember that in-state generation isn't the whole story. <a href=\"http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/total_system_power.html\">According to the California Energy Commission</a>, we imported enough coal-fired power from <em>out</em> of state in 2013 to make up almost 8 percent of the state's total use for that year. The Pacific Institute chose to omit imported energy from its calculations because a lot of the electrical power the state imports -- around 12.5 percent in 2013 -- isn't assignable to a specific energy source.</p>  <p>Still, both the in-state generation figures in the chart above and <a href=\"http://energyalmanac.ca.gov/electricity/total_system_power.html\">the Energy Commission's total figures for 2013</a> show that in that year, well into the current drought, hydro power's contribution to in-state generation was around 12 percent. </p>  <p>That's including output from hydroelectric plants of 30 megawatts and larger, which are counted in a separate \"large hydro\" category by the state, and those smaller than 30 megawatts, which are considered \"small hydro\" and counted along with wind, geothermal, and solar in the state's renewable energy totals.</p>  <p>By comparison, check out this similar graph we put together from 2011's stats:</p>  <div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewire/assets_c/2015/03/2011-chart1-3-18-15-thumb-630x480-89716.png\" width=\"630\" height=\"480\"  class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">2011 in-state energy generation by source | Graph: KCET</div></div>  <p>Nuclear power contributed only half the percentage of California in-state generation in 2013 that it did in 2011 because the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station shut down in 2012, leaving Diablo Canyon as the state's sole source of nuclear power. Solar and wind together rose by a cumulative three percentage points. Coal went down by a percentage point, and geothermal and biomass stayed the same.</p>  <p>But the really stark difference between 2011 and 2013 is in the relative output of hydro and natural gas. Hydroelectric power was 21 percent of the state's in-state generation in 2011, and dropped by nine percentage points to 12 percent in 2013 -- a power loss equivalent to San Onofre going offline.</p>  <p>And natural gas's share of the total rose from 45 to 61 percent to make up the difference, meaning a concomitant increase in emissions and energy costs -- as much as $1.4 billion in increased ratepayer costs from 2011 through 2014, according to the Pacific Institute report. And that increased natural gas burning is likely making the threat of future extended droughts worse due to increased greenhouse gas emissions.</p>  <p>Admittedly, 2011 was a reasonably wet year with great hydropower output; a statistical outlier in a string of increasingly dry years since 2007. That just underscores the state's need to conserve both power and water as we face an unpredictable future.</p>  <p>\"We hope this report prompts a lively debate on how to factor in a changing climate when we plan for electricity generation,\" said Glick.</p>]]>     </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Garagiste Festival 2015: Small Wine Productions, but Big on Flavor</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/socal-spirits/garagiste-2015-solvang-small-wine-productions.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/living/food//1240.80853</id>      <published>2015-03-18T21:44:00Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-19T00:20:08Z</updated>      <summary>Bellissimo Cellars, Levo Wine, and Workman/Ayer are just three of the more than 60 small production wineries pouring at the annual festival taking place in Solvang this year. </summary>     <author>         <name>George Yatchisin</name>         <uri>http://www.kcet.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;blog_id=1240&amp;id=16035</uri>     </author>              <category term=\"SoCal Spirits\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />          <category term=\"californiawines\" label=\"california wines\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"garagistes\" label=\"garagistes\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"smallbatch\" label=\"small batch\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"wine\" label=\"wine\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"winefestival\" label=\"wine festival\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"winetastings\" label=\"wine tastings\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"winemakers\" label=\"winemakers\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />          <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/\">         <![CDATA[<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/garagiste-logo-image-600-400.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><br /> Two-Buck Chuck (technically, Charles Shaw) produces and sells over 13,000 cases a day. The 156,000 bottles in those cases are enough so that every man, woman, and child in a city like the size of Lancaster, could drink one bottle everyday for a year. One might not want to imagine what this would do for the future of the city if this should ever happen.</p>  <p>And then there are the garagistes, who often start making wine in the garage. While the term is fancy and French, those making wines at such minuscule amounts are far from fancy, and doing it for the love of it. For this definition, a garagiste has to make under 1,500 cases annually, also known as one production day for Charles Shaw before noon. </p>  <p>Luckily garagistes have a wonderful event where they can collectively toot their horn, and the <a href=\"http://californiagaragistes.com\">3rd Annual Garagiste Festival</a> is coming to Solvang March 27-29. Here's a chance to taste wines from more than 60 wineries generally too small to have tasting rooms. The way Bret Urness from Levo Wines puts it, \"I want to create art and an experience with these wines. I want people to feel like they came from somewhere personal, because that's what these wines are to me. I know it sounds a bit romantic and clich\\ufffd\\ufffd, but when you produce as little wine as I do, it gives me the opportunity to know each barrel and lot. These wines are definitely a piece of me.\"</p>  <p>As an introduction, here are three producers who will be taking part in this year's events.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bellissimocellars.net\"><strong>Bellissimo Cellars</strong></a></p>  <p>We're talking small here -- perhaps 300 cases for the 2014 vintage of vineyard specific pinot noir, chardonnay, and Sangiovese from Santa Rita Hills and Santa Barbara County. \"I'm a production accountant for a major reality show,\" says owner and winemaker Lora Marie Taylor. \"That affords me the opportunity to fulfill this passion without compromising my values and I am not forced to make wine in a hurry. I am truly blessed because I receive a great deal of encouragement and support to continue with this passion.\"</p>  <p>Much of that encouragement comes from her family. \"Everyone pitches in and helps out in some way during harvest and bottling,\" Taylor says. \"It is wonderful to have the support and involvement of my family. My sons help out with hauling the fruit from the vineyards to the winery where we make the wines as well as sales and marketing. My 94-year-old mom also helped with bottling when we were working out of our garage. I have two friends who are also winemakers and they give me extra hands-on support needed during the entire process. It is definitely a family affair.\"</p>  <p>It was her upbringing that led her to winemaking in the first place. \"Being from Munich and experiencing great white German wines that my mom always served us was my beginning,\" she recalls. \"After I left home, I started tasting wines in Sonoma and the Russian River while attending college in that area. In 2008 I started going wine tasting in Santa Barbara County and a little north of there. I was fascinated and started doing research on what it would take to become a winemaker. I found that it was not that difficult so I started making wines in my garage in 2009, where I did so until 2013 when I decided to go public.\"</p>  <p>At Garagiste, she'll pour her Pinot Noir from the La Encantada Vineyard in Sta. Rita Hills, a chardonnay from Arroyo Seco, and a 2012 Sangiovese from her garage days.</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.levowine.com\"><strong>Levo Wine</strong></a></p>  <p>Bret Urness of Levo Wine is proud he won the Garagiste Big Blend Shootout in November. \"The wine that won was a 2013 barrel sample consisting of petite sirah, syrah, grenache, and a little white wine. It was a really raw wine, massive, 100% new oak, and still a baby. The wine was reviewed by fellow winemakers who fortunately have a good idea about the potential a wine could have down the road (assuming I don't mess things up). So I got lucky with the crowd. I think if it was a public tasting at Walmart I would've gone home empty handed.\" </p>  <p>Urness makes bold Paso Robles wines with evocative names like Bad Medicine, Ransom, and White Lightning. From his first 2011 vintage at 100 cases, he's now up to almost a 1,000 for his 2014 vintage. The wines are made in a \"small warehouse a friend's mom had on her property out in San Miguel. I took a couple of weeks and transformed the old winery from a storage unit into a small cellar. It's got AC, four walls, doors, and a 1950s Caterpillar fork lift. I'm not sure what the Napa folks would think about the space, but I think it's got a lot of character. Hopefully it rubs off on the wines a bit.\"</p>  <p>As for how he comes up with those great wine names, he explains, \"I find inspiration through my daily life, long car rides to vineyards, while working out. Nature, music, film, and art are all huge influences. Then eventually the overriding factor is the individual wine, or a lot's personality that makes the final decision. The wine bottle is such a great platform to release ideas on, and so many people squander it and blend in.\"</p>  <p>He'll be pouring his 2012 Bad Medicine Syrah, a Ransom 2012 Grenache/Syrah blend, and a 2013 White Lightning that's 64% roussanne and 36% viognier about which he says, \"This wine is the equivalent to drinking olive oil or honey. It's an experience for sure.\"</p>  <p><a href=\"https://www.workmanayer.com\"><strong>Workman/Ayer</strong></a></p>  <p>Michel Ayer isn't just a winemaker, but a lawyer, too. When he considers the connection between the two, he says, \"I think that as an attorney you are always dealing with incomplete information and trying to search for the best possible future outcome and I look at winemaking much the same way.\" </p>  <p>He's opted to do so with his family winery (Workman is his wife's name) by \"getting my hands on great Rhone varietals from top Central Coast vineyards for a fraction of the price of Napa and Sonoma fruit. When I initially looked at getting into the business, I thought I might do something with Italian varietals, but after tasting some of the Rhone varietals and blends from the Central Coast, I was smitten.\"</p>  <p>His wines, not surprisingly, take their names from the legal world. His red blend, \"de facto,\" now up to a whopping 100 cases, comes from his belief \"that blending can achieve something greater than the sum of its parts. It also keeps things interesting when preparing each vintage for bottle to taste through the various lots and determine what makes the 'best' blend.\"</p>  <p>In addition to vintages of \"de facto,\" he will pour his viognier \"ipso facto,\" in two vintages, 2013 and 2014, both from Ballard Canyon fruit. He points out, \"We don't have a tasting room, so the festival is the perfect time for us to release our new wines in addition to our existing mailing list patrons, brokers, and distributors.\" <br /> </p>]]>     </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Art + Practice: Connecting Past and Future in Leimert Park</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/art-practice-leimert-park.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/arts/artbound//1834.80852</id>      <published>2015-03-18T20:52:20Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-19T00:20:05Z</updated>      <summary>The nonprofit organization Art + Practice reflects the shifting concerns of Leimert Park&apos;s long-established Black community as the neighborhood responds to economic and social changes.</summary>     <author>         <name>Anuradha Vikram</name>         <uri>http://www.kcet.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;blog_id=1834&amp;id=17328</uri>     </author>              <category term=\"Los Angeles\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />              <category term=\"Multi-Disciplinary\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />          <category term=\"artpractice\" label=\"Art + Practice\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"charlesgaines\" label=\"Charles Gaines\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"hammermuseum\" label=\"Hammer Museum\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"lacounty\" label=\"la county\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"leimertpark\" label=\"Leimert Park\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"losangeles\" label=\"Los Angeles\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"therightwayfoundation\" label=\"The RightWay Foundation\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />          <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/\">         <![CDATA[<p>Outside the pristine white warehouse that houses Art + Practice is a lively street filled with chatter and laughter. Inside, stillness: the silent scores of <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/charles-gaines-hammer-museum.html\">Charles Gaines</a>' solemn \"Librettos: Manuel de Falla/Stokely Carmichael.\" At first glance, the white cube gallery seems far removed from the vibrant neighborhood in which it sits. Anticipating a community center, one instead finds a museum. The Gaines show is programmed by the Hammer Museum as a complement to the L.A.-based artist's retrospective \"Gridwork: 1974-1989\" and installed as impeccably as its pedigree would indicate. Yet the values that underpin Art + Practice are not those of a typical art museum, in which silent reflection in the company of objects is generally of primary importance while audience engagement is a secondary, if growing, priority. Flipping this equation, Art + Practice foregrounds social welfare services while preserving a space for quiet contemplation that many of its constituents are rarely able to access. This combination presents uncommon advantages as well as challenges, positioning the organization to serve two very different constituencies with potentially complementary, but also conflicting, needs and expectations.</p>  <p>Art + Practice is a non-profit launched by celebrated artist and MacArthur fellow Mark Bradford with partners, social activist Allan diCastro and collector and philanthropist Eileen Harris Norton, in Leimert Park. The new space joins neighbors Papillion Art, The World Stage, KAOS Network, and <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/leimert-park/meeting-of-the-minds-convening-consciousness-and-culture-at-eso-won-books.html\">Eso Won Books</a> (soon to relocate to a space within Art + Practice) within the arts corridor along Degnan and Leimert Boulevards. This is one of Los Angeles' most compelling and long-established arts enclaves, representing the spectrum of performing, cinematic, literary, and visual arts. Says diCastro, Art + Practice's Interim Executive Director, \"we are dovetailing into an already existing history of cultural variety.\" Spaces with a quarter-century of history in the neighborhood intersperse with new arrivals bearing a post-conceptual aesthetic. \"In order to change things and be a part of the conversation, you have to take a vested interest in the neighborhood,\" explains Bradford in the catalogue that accompanied Art + Practice's recent launch. \"You have to be present in the community.\" Through both its architecture and its programming, Art + Practice reflects the shifting concerns of Leimert Park's long-established Black community as the neighborhood responds to economic and social changes and prepares for still more. The pending arrival of the Crenshaw/LAX Metro in 2019 has many residents anticipating sweeping changes as the close-knit and somewhat isolated local community expands to accommodate an influx of newcomers. At the same time, local artists and activists are working to ensure that the established cultural character of the neighborhood is not lost as so often happens when ethnic strongholds become desirable real estate. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Workshop for transitional foster youth at RightWay Foundation\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/RWF-Workshop.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"435\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Art + Practice is not the first socially-minded contemporary art venue to open in a historically Black community with aspirations to connect under-served audiences with post-conceptual art practices. A leader in this space is Rick Lowe, whose Project Row Houses in Houston, Texas, has served as a model for how to equitably and sustainably promote social change through the arts for over 20 years. Lowe is a member of Art + Practice's Board of Trustees along with prominent leaders from museum, entertainment, and social activism backgrounds. Others who have followed Lowe's lead include Theaster Gates' Rebuild Foundation in Chicago and Edgar Arceneaux's Watts House Project in Los Angeles. DiCastro calls these precedents \"definitely inspirational,\" adding, \"Anytime you extend a hand in a community it is to be applauded.\" Considering how Art + Practice is likely to draw affluent art audiences to the under-resourced neighborhood of Leimert Park, he states, \"I would say the risks, if any, are far outweighed by the rewards of bringing another layer of culture into the area.\" </p>  <p><img alt=\"Transitional foster youth participants at RightWay Foundation\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/RWF-1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Foster youth representing RightWay Foundation at South Lost Angeles Transitional Age Youth & Foster Care Service Collaborative\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/RWF2.JPG\" width=\"580\" height=\"385\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Art + Practice demonstrates a commitment to the needs of Leimert Park's residents by hosting non-profit social welfare organization, <a href=\"http://www.therightwayfoundation.org/\">The RightWay Foundation</a>, within its space. \"RightWay Foundation has a large potential benefit, as a social organization\" housed at Art + Practice, \"because it is specifically located within a zip code (90008) that has an enormous foster youth population,\" explains diCastro. Adds Bradford in the catalogue, \"I believe contemporary artists have a lot of great ideas, but unlike those working in the field of social service they don't always apply those ideas directly. Art + Practice aspires to be a space where the social aspect of art - the practice of it - puts the art into a context of action.\" RightWay works with youth in the foster care system to instill self-esteem along with practical skills, targeting a vulnerable population who are over-represented in historically Black communities like Leimert Park as a consequence of devastating policies around drug use and incarceration. Connection with an arts public has been valuable for RightWay, as Director of Programs, Andraya Slyter describes: \"Being housed within an arts institution has exposed the art community and patrons of the arts to the experiences and needs of Transitional Age Foster Youth and has evoked a strong desire in these individuals to assist the RightWay Foundation [to] carry out its mission and vision by serving in various capacities (volunteers, mentors).\" RightWay's facilities include a large classroom space and a computer lab, as well as free access to Art + Practice's exhibition and artist in residence programs. Says Slyter, \"Exposure to the arts diversifies and enriches our youths' experiences and interests. Although some of our youth have been involved in the arts, they find it necessary to shift focus from their interests to their basic needs due to homelessness, unemployment, and mental health instability.\" In response, \"The RightWay Foundation can assist them with meeting their social and emotional needs while they are given opportunities to explore their interests through the arts. Art can also be used as a therapeutic tool to explore and share their experiences.\" RightWay clients also benefit from technological tools developed by artists through Art + Practice to address issues endemic to foster youth, such as disconnection from siblings and family members, in a direct way. The organization's residency is in effect through 2016. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Installation view of Charles Gaines: Librettos: Manuel de Falla/ Stokely Carmichael at Art + Practice, February 28-May 31, 2015. | Photo: Josh White\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Photo-Joshua_White-jwpictures.com-5519.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Charles Gaines: Librettos: Manuel de Falla/ Stokely Carmichael at Art + Practiceg\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Librettos_2015_02.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Exhibition programming at Art + Practice is overseen by the Hammer Museum, another program partner through 2016. The inaugural installation by renowned artist and educator Charles Gaines is both historically and politically charged. </p>  <p>\"The Hammer and Art + Practice decided that Charles would be an ideal artist to launch the exhibition program at Art + Practice because of our respect and admiration for his work, his role as a longtime educator and mentor to other artists, and his relationship with Mark Bradford, which started when Charles taught him at CalArts,\" explains Hammer Senior Curator Anne Ellegood, who organized the Gaines retrospective currently on view at the Hammer and the exhibition at Art + Practice. Engaging themes of race and class consciousness, Gaines pairs the libretto of Manuel de Falla's \"La Vida Breve (The Brief Life)\" (c. 1904), the tragic tale of a young Gypsy woman whose love affair with a man of the upper class ends in her rejection and death, with a 1967 speech delivered by Black Panther and SNCC activist Stokely Carmichael, in which he challenges Black youth to value and respect their own cultural heritage instead of aspiring to white cultural values. The work is constructed of Plexiglas boxes with de Falla's score and libretto written on the surface, and Carmichael's text printed behind, such that the two disparate scripts play off one another visually. Though separated by language, continent, and context, both sources blend considerations of racial difference and discrimination with questions of class and social access, subjects likely to resonate with an audience of neighborhood residents and youth in the foster care system.</p>  <p>\"Charles created 'Librettos' for the Art + Practice gallery,\" says Ellegood. As a site-specific work, it's quite a provocative response to its context. Gaines' choice to include de Falla's composition, which speaks to racial and economic segregation but also represents the European classical tradition, diverges from Carmichael's lament that \"they teach 'em Bach, Vivaldi, Rachmaninoff, and all those other cats\" but not Miles Davis, Mahalia Jackson, or Ray Charles. The work of Black contemporary artists is fraught with such contrasts, reflective of the pressures they face to represent their own cultural viewpoints while negotiating a system of recognition and reward that continues to treat white artists and white cultural touchstones preferentially.</p>  <p><img alt=\"Installation view of Charles Gaines: Librettos: Manuel de Falla/ Stokely Carmichael at Art + Practice, February 28-May 31, 2015. | Photo: Josh White\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Photo-Joshua_White-jwpictures.com-5534.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Similarly, one wonders how Carmichael would respond to the white cube of the Art + Practice gallery, which recalls the architecture of mainstream art institutions more than that of the Black Arts Movement venues that have preceded its arrival in Leimert Park. Museums still maintain an appallingly poor record of engagement with minority audiences, especially Black ones. Art + Practice's own literature puts the percentage of minority \"core visitors\" to museums at 9 percent, meaning that the percentage of people of color who visit museums consistently is 13 percent lower than the percentage of minorities in the U.S. population on the whole. The American Alliance of Museums' 2010 report \"Demographic Transformation and the Future of Museums,\" from which Art + Practice's statistic is presumably cited, paints an even more dismal picture, indicating that as minority representation in the general population has increased, museum attendance by minorities has continued to decline. Not only are museums failing to attract new minority visitors as the population becomes more diverse -- they are failing to retain the minority visitors they already had, resulting in a much wider gap in representation within museum audiences than within the population as a whole. Asked about these numbers, diCastro states, \"Only time may provide us all with more statistics to analyze these concerns.\"</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p>Ellegood expresses how her staff \"recognize that minorities are under-represented as visitors to museums,\" and how they \"were excited to collaborate with Art + Practice on an initiative with a goal to increase visitorship in these under-represented communities.\" She continues, \"It was important to us and to Art + Practice that the gallery be free (as is the Hammer) and accessible, and we are all committed to presenting a program of exhibitions and public talks rich with diversity.\" </p>  <p>Some of those programs include artist residencies by artist and former Leimert Park gallerist Dale Brockman Davis, who showed celebrated Black artists including David Hammons and Senga Nengudi at the start of their careers, and Mexican-American painter Sandy Rodriguez, who will discuss her work about transformative and sometimes violent changes in Los Angeles in conversation with Angel's Gate Cultural Center curator and director of visual arts, Isabelle Lutterodt, at Art + Practice on March 18 at 7:30 pm. An upcoming exhibition later this spring will highlight the work of these artists along with a third L.A.-based resident artist, Pakistani-born sculptor Aalia Brown. In the fall, Art + Practice will present the work of Nigerian-born, L.A.-based figurative painter Njikdeka Akunyili Crosby, followed by a retrospective of pioneering assemblage sculptor and Watts Towers Art Center founder John Outterbridge in December. </p>  <p>In addition to its focus on social activism, Art + Practice also aspires to be a platform for the creation and presentation of new works of art. According to Ellegood, \"Exhibitions at Art + Practice will generally (although not necessarily exclusively) include new work by artists.\" Being situated on the site of Bradford's former studio and his mother's former hair salon, Art + Practice inherits a legacy of artistic creation as well as social cohesion from these two preceding venues. The inclusion of an artist in residence program further advances that promise of creation, as well as allowing the youth and community members whom Art + Practice aspires to serve access to working artists and to the creative process. Such exposure promises to open up a world of inspiration to a population too often expected to prioritize survival over imagination. It can be hoped as well that art-savvy audiences who make the trip to Leimert Park to appreciate Art + Practice's innovative programming also come to recognize the rich cultural resources that precede its arrival in the neighborhood.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Dig this story? <a href=\"http://kcet.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c2be079f33ff6f73d5571f3ac&id=a379363cac\">Sign up</a> for our newsletter to get unique arts & culture stories and videos from across Southern California in your inbox.

The sea blew ragged, but the mouth of the Big River was a deep blue calm.</p>  <p>Directly below me, five twenty-somethings stood on the dark rocks as the ocean sighed and moved just off their feet. The three men were fishing. The girls watched the sunset. None of them seemed the least bit concerned with the oncoming darkness. All wore thick flannels and wool caps in deference to the ever cooling wind.</p>  <p>A man stepped up beside me.</p>  <p>Eschewing a greeting, he grumbled, \"Stupid kids. How are they going to find their way back in the dark?\"</p>  <p>I try to give my fellow man the benefit of the doubt, but it is also true I have small tolerance for the grumpy and the judgmental. I had already seen the well-stocked contents of the red and white cooler tucked up against the cliff, and a full moon was already in the sky. It seemed to me a fine way to spend the night.</p>  <p>I smiled at the man.</p>  <p>\"I wouldn't mind being down there with them,\" I said.</p>  <p>He grimaced at me as if he might give me a push so I could join them.</p>  <p>\"Well then, you're out of your mind too,\" he said.</p>  <p>I nodded agreeably. It was a possibility. </p>  <p>\"Maybe gravity got the best of them,\" I said.</p>  <p>\"Huh?\" </p>  <p>Mendocino is not without its New Agers, old hippies, and displaced Rastafarians. There is often a sweet smell in the air. It was not hard to see what my companion was thinking.</p>  <p>\"I was walking the streets before I came down here,\" I said. </p>  <p>He harrumphed.</p>  <p>\"You are crazy,\" he said, leaving before I had the chance to tell him what I had discovered.</p>  <p>As the light left the sky, I looked down a last time at the gathering below me. One of the fishermen had put down a pole and taken up a young girl's hand. Moonlight winked on the water. </p>  <p>How can you not like Mendocino, where all the streets tilt to the sea?</p>  <p>That night I ate Brazilian fish stew at the <a href=\"http://www.mendocinocafe.com/\">Mendocino Caf\\ufffd\\ufffd</a>, where they pride themselves on \"serving international cuisine composed of organic ingredients healthy for the planet and our customers.\" Not that this distinguished the cafe from most of the other local businesses. The stew was piping hot and delicious, a coconut broth liberally endowed with rock shrimp, mussels, clams, calamari and fish. It made me think of my friends at the ocean's edge, and when I walked back out on to the headland after dinner, I didn't even need to walk to the cliff's edge. I could hear their laughter, coming up over the cliffs and running through the moonlight.<br /> </p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p><br /> Mendocino County has many offerings, including spectacular seascapes (Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands National Monument), fun for the family (ride the Skunk Train through the Noyo River Canyon) and an ever-burgeoning wine scene, known for its Alsatian varietals and sparkling wine producers in places like Eagle Peak and the Redwood, Potter, and Anderson Valleys.</p>  <p>But whatever you choose to do when you visit, you shouldn't neglect a leisurely stroll around Mendocino itself. Lovely and quirky, it is a fine place to amble. If ever flower gardens and white picket fences take over the world, the assault will begin here.  And the offbeat and the independent are everywhere. Inside <a href=\"http://www.cornersofthemouth.com/\">Corners of the Mouth</a> (a natural foods store housed in an old Baptist church) you can pick through baskets of organic produce, receive a wellness consultation, or wander upstairs to the Herb Room, where, along with over 250 herbs and spices, you'll also find a herbal reference library so you'll know what it is you're buying. A sign on the wall says \"Food For People. Not For Profit.\" Outside a jacked-up pickup pulled into the parking lot. A burly, lumberjack of a fellow clambered down, strode to the back, dropped the tailgate, hopped up, situated himself comfortably and began to play the flute beautifully. There are women with lots of hair and men with lots more hair. It is a place of literacy, free speech, and independence, evidenced by a sticker, affixed (independently) over a speed limit sign. \"Read M-F..ing Books All Damn Day.\" </p>  <p>But mostly Mendocino is a place of natural beauty, which is why I signed on for a kayak trip on the Noyo River with <a href=\"http://liquidfusionkayak.com/\">Liquid Fusion Kayaking</a>. Liquid Fusion is tucked at the edge of tiny Noyo Harbor, a working harbor with boats sun and salt blistered, and great blue herons riding their silhouettes across the still waters.</p>  <div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/noyoharbor.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">Photo:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/thaths/2535857426/\">thaths</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></div></div>  <p>On the morning I arrived, the white board hanging outside Liquid Fusion's office listed mule deer (33), California sea lions (likely too numerous to count), green herons, Pacific loons, Western pond turtles and a red-shouldered hawk.</p>  <p>Owner Jeff Laxier peered over my shoulder.</p>  <p>\"That was one day,\" he said. \"And there are things missing.\" </p>  <p>I liked Jeff. He was funny and soft spoken, and he made no mention of his many certifications or skills, nor did he mention that he was a former member of the San Diego Mountain Rescue Team and the U.S. Marine Corps. I liked Cate Hawthorne, too. She brimmed with energy and she, too, possessed a quiet competence garnered in an arena every bit as forbidding as the U.S. Marine Corps -- public schools.</p>  <p>Mostly I liked them because they both loved what they were doing. </p>  <p>Jeff grinned.</p>  <p>\"We go out and we play, and we bring people with us. If it ain't fun, we aren't going to do it.\"</p>  <p>As we paddled up the calm, sun-dappled river, Cate and Jeff took turns pointing things out. Here a kingfisher's nest in the river bank; there an osprey in the trees, an otter trotting across a gravel bar, and the shadowy outline of a harbor seal gliding right past my kayak, followed by her pup. At one point Cate raised her hand and we went silent. On the riverbank, a doe and her fawn stood pinioned in the sun. We watched them. They watched us. Then the fawn gave a little jump and they were both gone. </p>  <p>The whiteboard had undersold the river.</p>  <p>Nor was the Noyo my only magical brush with a river. Throughout Mendocino County, rivers run to the sea, and you should find your own place beside one. I did, pulling off to the side of the road somewhere in <a href=\"http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=435\">Navarro River Redwoods State Park</a>. Following a path through the shadows of the forest, I stepped out onto a white bright sand bank. At midday the sand was frying pan hot, but the Navarro River offered handy remedy. As discreetly as possible I sprinted for the water, high stepping past yet another clot of twenty-somethings.  </p>  <div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/kayaking_noyo2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">Photo:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/jdlasica/4699441690/\">JD Lasica</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></div></div>  <p>It is fine to turn slowly with the river's eddies while overhead swallows dart and fat white clouds drift lazily.</p>  <p>The river was cool, bordering on cold. When I got out, I was able to walk across the sand with something resembling dignity.</p>  <p>As I passed the twenty-somethings, one of them grinned and said, \"Sand's pretty hot.\"</p>  <p>\"You're not kidding,\" I said.</p>  <p>This time I did a mock dance, but they laughed just the same.</p>  <p>One of the boys cocked his head.</p>  <p>\"Hey,\" he said. \"Were you out on the headlands the other night?\"</p>  <p>I knew them and I laughed.</p>  <p>\"How was the fishing?\" I asked.</p>  <p>\"Caught a few rockfish. It was a good night.\"</p>  <p>I was twenty once.</p>  <p>I thought of the full moon.</p>  <p>\"I bet it was,\" I said.</p>]]>     </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Public Swimming Pools in Los Angeles</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/excursions/public-swimming-pools-in-los-angeles.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/living/travel//2184.80847</id>      <published>2015-03-18T19:03:50Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-18T22:19:28Z</updated>      <summary>History buff, aspiring athlete, or desert rat?

After a lifetime in New York State's snow belt, I was ready to be able to swim outdoors all year long. </p>  <p>I know that there's a whole ocean out West, but I prefer the self-contained environment of a pool -- filtered water with no sharks or jellyfish, no waves to rip my bikini top off, and no sand to get in my bikini bottom. It's a perfectly civilized, controlled situation to do laps. </p>  <p>Sure, at times, it gets a little too nippy for swimming outside. But consider the 90 degree heatwave we experienced during the winter, while the rest of the country is just starting to thaw out! So why not take advantage? If you don't have a pool in your own housing complex or backyard, you can probably find one close enough to your home or work to take a dip without having to drive far.</p>  <p>But if you're looking for a pool with its own unique style and history, here are some of the most intriguing, non-ocean outdoor swimming locations around L.A.:</p>  <div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/annenberg.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">Photo:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/sgroi/5925109195/\">sgroi</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></div></div>  <p><strong>Best for Architecture and History Buffs</strong><br /> It may sound strange to swim in a chlorinated pool along the beach, but the <a href=\"http://annenbergbeachhouse.com\"><u><u>Annenberg Community Beach House</u></u></a> pool is a pretty special place. Located in Santa Monica off the Pacific Coast Highway, this is one of the last remaining traces of a grand estate built by publishing baron William Randolph Hearst for his mistress, actress Marion Davies. Big movie stars like Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, and Charlie Chaplin used to relax and play here. </p>  <p>These days, a wristband allows you all-day, in-and-out access to the ornate marble pool and free tours of the restored Marion Davies guest house (both designed by architect Julia Morgan), as well as the entire grounds and the actual ocean and beach -- so it's best to arrive in the morning before it fills up, and stay all day. You can dine at an adjacent sit-down restaurant, order take away from a quick serve window, or bring your own in (but no alcohol or glass bottles). </p>  <p>The pool is divided into two sections, leaving the families and tikes in their swimmies in the shallow end and more advanced swimmers in the deep end. There are plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas for reclining. The beach house is technically closed October through Memorial Day, but during those months it does open for a number of \"bonus pool days\" when the weather permits. To guarantee your spot, reserve <a href=\"http://annenbergbeachhouse.com/activities/pool-and-fitness-room.aspx\">online</a> 1-3 days in advance. For a more affordable option, try it out on one of their dollar swim Mondays, and avoid parking fees by riding a bicycle or the Big Blue Bus to the pool.</p>  <p><strong>Location:</strong> 415 Pacific Coast Highway, Santa Monica 90402<br /> <strong>Season:</strong> Memorial Day through September, plus Bonus Pool Days<br /> <strong>Price: </strong>$10 adults, $5 Seniors (60+) and $4 Youth (17 and under) + parking (up to $12/day max)</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p><img alt=\"Photo: Sandi Hemmerlein\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/Stadium-ExpoPark.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p><strong>Best for Sports Fans</strong><br /> This isn't just a swimming pool: this is a swim stadium, originally constructed for the 1932 Summer Olympics and renovated in 2003. Open all year and heated, this historic Art Deco aquatic facility is located in the shadow of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Exposition Park, and actually features three different open-air pools: one for lap swimming, one for general recreational swimming, and a shallow one for wading, outfitted with some poolside fake grass and palm trees to create a nice little oasis. </p>  <p>For those who like to do more than swim laps in a competitive pool environment, this facility also offers a variety of sport programs for novices including water polo and synchronized swimming. A schedule of activities is available on their <a href=\"http://laparks.org/expo/index.htm\">official site</a>. </p>  <p><strong>Location: </strong>3980 Bill Robertson Lane (near MLK Jr. Blvd.) Los Angeles, 90037<br /> <strong>Season: </strong>Year-Round<br /> <strong>Price:</strong> $3.50 per session for adults, $1.00 for seniors, children, and persons with disabilities + parking ($1 for three hours $6/day max; free street parking is available in the surrounding neighborhood)</p>  <div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/rosebowl.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">Photo:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ikkoskinen/332256327\">ikkoskinen</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></div></div>  <p><strong>Best for Aspiring Athletes and Superheroes</strong><br /> In Pasadena, you can swim among legends at the <a href=\"http://www.rosebowlaquatics.com/\">Rose Bowl Aquatics Center</a>, which served as a pre-Olympic training facility for the U.S. swimming and diving team and hosted the U.S. National Diving Championships. Located next to the 93-year-old Rose Bowl Stadium, its swim club is home to a number of well-known athletes -- but anyone can take advantage of the center's water fitness and therapy programs, lap swim sessions, and swim lessons. Aspiring heroes can take courses in CPR, first aid, and lifeguard training. And this place is huge: it has two Olympic-sized pools which can go as deep as 17 feet, one of which contains 55,000 gallons of warm water. </p>  <p>Visitors can also use a number of diving boards, spring boards, and two hydrotherapy spas. If you forget any of your gear, you can purchase a large selection of items in their aquatic pro shop, and get a snack at their food and beverage center. </p>  <p><strong>Location:</strong> 360 North Arroyo Blvd., Pasadena 91103<br /> <strong>Season: </strong>Year-Round (check their <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rbac_updates\">Twitter feed</a> for closures)<br /> <strong>Price: </strong>$12 Adult, $9 Young Adult and Senior, $1-2 family swim + always free parking</p>  <p><strong>Best for Planespotting</strong><br /> If you like the idea of swimming in an Olympic-sized pool in the middle of an urban landscape and watching planes take off from and land at LAX overhead, then Culver City has the pool for you. Opened in 1949, the Municipal Plunge has been serving the community for decades with an amazing facility that they keep in pristine condition with a regular maintenance schedule and a respectful clientele. </p>  <p>Non-Olympians can take advantage of short-course lap swimming, the recreational swimming section, and a number of swimming classes and lessons. If you're lucky, you can catch a glimpse of one of the many professional training exercises that take place at the <a href=\"http://www.culvercity.org/government/prcs/recreation/aquatics.aspx\">Culver City Plunge</a>, including those for the fire department's Swift Water Rescue team, whose members are dispatched to flood areas or even the L.A. River, where people (and animals) have been known to get trapped in rushing water. In the summer, expect a lot of noisy kids in the pool and locker room areas. Keep track of closures and extended hours on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Culvercityplunge\">Plunge Facebook page</a>. </p>  <p><strong>Location:</strong> 4175 Overland Avenue, Culver City 90230<br /> <strong>Season: </strong>Year-Round<br /> <strong>Price:</strong> $4 Adults, $2.50 Youths, Seniors, and persons with disabilities + free parking in lot</p>  <p><img alt=\"Photo: Sandi Hemmerlein\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/HansenDam.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p><strong>Best for Families and Desert Rats</strong><br /> Sometimes I can't even believe this place exists anywhere, much less in the San Fernando Valley. It's considered a swim lake in the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, adjacent to a fishing and boating lake. It's made of poured concrete and filled with chlorinated water like a regular pool, but you can wade right into it, shallow enough for the tiniest of tots. With a gradual decline to its deepest section (a mere 4.5 feet), an average adult could walk across the entire pool, which is not necessarily an easy feat, at 1.5 acres. This pool is gigantic. It can fit up to 2,800 swimmers at any one time. The focus here is on the outdoor facilities: two thrilling water slides, a man-made sandy beach, picnic area, and cabanas. </p>  <p>There are outdoor showers and private dressing rooms and toilet stalls, but no official locker room, lockers, or bag check -- so you must keep your personal belongings to a minimum, and guard them closely. It's almost always sunny here, and way hotter than the beach cities, making Hansen Dam a unique and surreal experience. Even if you don't live nearby, it's worth the day trip just for the view of the mountains and a cool reprieve from that hot, dry air.</p>  <p><strong>Location:</strong> 11798 Foothill Blvd., Lake View Terrace 91342 (follow signs)<br /> <strong>Season:</strong> Summer (May-September)<br /> <strong>Price:</strong> $3.50 Adults (discounted with an LA City library card), $1 Children, Seniors, and persons with disabilities + free parking. Canopy rental $18-40 half- or full-day, with or without furniture.</p>  <p><strong>Pro tips:</strong> <br /> Frequent swimmers looking to save some money can inquire about purchasing a pass, which can significantly reduce the price per visit. Proper swim attire is always required at all public facilities, and children must be accompanied by an adult at all times. </p>  <p>For everyone's safety, running is never permitted, and diving is only allowed from a proper diving board and at certain scheduled times. </p>  <p>You'll have to rinse off before you enter the pool, and recent changes to the health code prohibit any shaving of any kind in the showers (as well as entering the pool with any open wounds or sores, or any recent incidence of diarrhea). </p>  <p>Be prepared when you go: bring your own towel, swim cap and goggles, as they are not provided or made available for purchase at most places (though not always required). </p>  <p>Bring your own lock to secure your personal belongings in lockers while you swim, though some other municipal pools do provide a bag check guarded by an attendant. </p>  <p>Most lifeguards place several swimmers in the same lane, requiring them to swim in a circle (always staying on the right) to control traffic. Choose the lane speed that's right for you: lanes are usually marked for slow, medium, and fast swimmers. </p>]]>     </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>How &apos;Natural&apos; Are the Natural Foods You Eat?</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/food-rant/natural-labeling-in-healthy-and-natural-foods.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/living/food//1240.80843</id>      <published>2015-03-18T18:50:32Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-19T00:07:25Z</updated>      <summary>Though the FDA considers these synthetic additives to be relatively safe, they may still appear in your natural food products.

Seeing as there's no clear-cut definition for what the term means (as opposed to something like \"<a href=\"http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateC&navID=ConsumerlinkNOPAccreditationandCertification&rightNav1=ConsumerlinkNOPAccreditationandCertification&topNav=&leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&page=NOPConsumers&resultType=&acct=nopgeninfo\">USDA Organic</a>,\" which is a label certification for two levels of organic food products), the word is used on food packaging willy-nilly. But that era is just about over. </p>  <p>Over the past few years, many class-action lawsuits have been filed against a wide range of companies regarding their usage of the word. In most cases, the companies either lost their case in court, or chose to settle, sometimes for millions of dollars. </p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/06/what-is-natural-food-even-the-people-who-make-it-arent-sure/\">At a conference in Anaheim a few weeks ago</a>, food lawyer Michele Simon -- who I interviewed last year <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/food-rant/food-companies-defend-natural-in-court.html\">about these lawsuits</a> -- detailed a long list of food additives that could soon be named in class-action lawsuits. While these ingredients are categorized as Generally Regarded As Safe (or, \"GRAS\") by the FDA, these ingredients may show up in foods that are promoted as \"natural.\" It isn't to say they're bad (in a lot of cases, they're not), just inaccurate. It's still important to know just what these ingredients do. </p>  <p>Feel free to bookmark this list and head on back whenever an item on the back of your label is particularly confounding. </p>  <p><strong>Ascorbic acid:</strong> A synthetic version of vitamin C.</p>  <p><strong>Beta carotene:</strong> Synthetic version of the substance found in carrots, pumpkins, and sweet potatoes that give them their orange color and used often as food dye. </p>  <p><strong>Biotin:</strong> Synthetic form of vitamin H, found naturally in leafy greens, peanuts, and Swiss chard. </p>  <p><strong>Calcium pantothenate:</strong> Synthetic version of vitamin B5, which is naturally found in eggs, meat, veggies, and legumes. </p>  <p><strong>Calcium phosphate:</strong> Synthetic form of the family of minerals that includes calcium ions, naturally occurring in bovine milk and blood. </p>  <p><strong>Calcium sulfate:</strong> Synthetic version of calcium salt, used to \"increase product quality.\"</p>  <p><strong>Caramel color:</strong> An artificial coloring substance most commonly used to color sodas. In large doses, it is <a href=\"http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2014/01/caramel-color-the-health-risk-that-may-be-in-your-soda/index.htm\">a possible carcinogen</a>. </p>  <p><strong>Citric acid:</strong> While it's found in natural citrus like oranges and lemons, the synthetic version is also used to add tart flavors to food. </p>  <p><strong>Cochineal extract (color):</strong> Used as a red food coloring, and <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/food/ingredient/bugjuice.asp\">made of ground up tropical bugs</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Cyanocobalamin:</strong> A synthetic chemical form of vitamin B12, found naturally in meat, fish, poultry, and eggs.  </p>  <p><strong>d-alpha-tocopherol:</strong> Synthetic form of vitamin E found in fat-containing food, like vegetable oils. </p>  <p><strong>D-calcium pantothenate:</strong> Synthetic form of vitamin B5, which is found in meat, vegetables, and cereal grains.</p>  <p><strong>Disodium phosphate:</strong> Additive that combines phosphate, phosphorus and sodium. Used in foods to regulate acidity, as well as maintain the proper moisture level. </p>  <p><strong>Fibersol-2:</strong> Essentially, fake fiber. In a lot of cases, it's added to foods <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2009/03/dietary_fibber.html\">that are promoted as sources of dietary fiber</a>.</p>  <p><strong>Fructooligosaccharides:</strong> Synthetic extract from the agave plant, used to sweeten diet or low-calorie foods and beverages. </p>  <p><strong>Glycerin or vegetable glycerin:</strong> Colorless, odorless agent used to conserve preserved fruits and sweeten low-calorie foods. </p>  <p><strong>Hexane:</strong> A solvent made from crude oil that's generally used in food to extract vegetable oil from plant seeds. </p>  <p><strong>Inulin:</strong> Derived from chicory, and used to replace sugar, fat, and flour in foods. </p>  <p><strong>Magnesium phosphate:</strong> A general term for synthetic salts, used mostly as an anti-caking agent in foods. </p>  <p><strong>Monocalcium phosphate:</strong> Another synthetic salt used as a leavening agent in foods, but also present in a whole lot of fertilizers. </p>  <p><strong>Niacinamide:</strong> Synthetic form of vitamin B3, which helps the body convert carbs into energy. </p>  <p><strong>Phytonadione:</strong> Synthetic version of vitamin K, which is used to treat and prevent blood clotting issues. It is found naturally in green leafy vegetables, Brussels sprouts, fish, and eggs. </p>  <p><strong>Potassium carbonate:</strong> Used most often in cooking to regulate the acidity and alkalinity, as well as to stabilize the dispersal of the ingredients. It is found in baked goods like cakes, as well as soft drinks as a fizzing agent. </p>  <p><strong>Potassium citrate:</strong> Used as an additive in many soft drinks to act as a buffering agent, to maintain the acidity. </p>  <p><strong>Potassium iodide:</strong> While it's naturally forming in kelp, the synthetic version is used to iodize regular table salt. </p>  <p><strong>Pyridoxine hydrochloride:</strong> A synthetic version of vitamin B6 that's used to treat anemia, heart disease, high cholesterol, and morning sickness. However, long term use may result in certain brain and nervous system problems. </p>  <p><strong>Sodium acid pyrophosphate:</strong> Synthetic salt used as a leavening agent and stabilizer. </p>  <p><strong>Sodium benzoate:</strong> Synthetic salt used as a food preserver. Most often found in soft drinks. </p>  <p><strong>Sodium citrate:</strong> Synthetic version of citric acid, used to add sour and salty flavors to food. </p>  <p><strong>Sodium dioxide:</strong> Most often used in wine as a preservative, under the more commonly-used name \"sulfites.\"</p>  <p><strong>Sodium molybdate:</strong> Chemically altered form of sodium that's used most often in fertilizers. When it ends up in food, it's in trace amounts from these fertilizers. </p>  <p><strong>Sodium selenite:</strong> Used more often in dog food, but occasionally used in human \"health\" items like supplement pills and shakes. </p>  <p><strong>Soy ingredients (textured soy protein, soy grits, soy flour):</strong> One of the most ubiquitous additives, it has all of the worrying elements that comes with soy (i.e., estrogen mimicry, although even <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/food-rant/some-types-of-soy-may-be-beneficial-to-girls.html\">that is far from proven</a>). Also, most of it's produced with GMOs. </p>  <p><strong>Soy lecithin:</strong> See above.</p>  <p><strong>Soy protein concentrate:</strong> Basically the same as above. Used in health foods and soy products. </p>  <p><strong>Soy protein isolate:</strong> A refined version of the above concentrate.</p>  <p><strong>Steviol glycoside:</strong> This is the synthetic sweetener found in Stevia. </p>  <p><strong>Sucralose:</strong> Another artificial sweetener, used in diet sodas and low- or no-calorie sweet foods. </p>  <p><strong>Synthetic fiber such as Fibersol-2:</strong> See: Fibersol-2 above. </p>  <p><strong>Thiamine hydrochloride:</strong> Synthetic form of vitamin B1, which helps decrease the risk of metabolic disorders, glaucoma, and heart disease. </p>  <p><strong>Vitamin A, palmitate:</strong> Synthetic salt used as a dietary supplement and a fortifying agent in dairy. </p>  <p><strong>Vitamin D2:</strong> Also known as ergocalciferol, it is a supplement used to treat osteoporosis. </p>  <p><strong>Xanthan gum:</strong> Another additive found in just about everything, this is used as a food thickening agent, most often found in salad dressings and sauces. </p>  <p><strong>Zinc methionine sulfate:</strong> Used as an additive to raise the zinc levels of a supplement.</p>  <p><strong>Zinc oxide:</strong> Also used to raise the levels of zinc, most often in breakfast cereals. </p>  <p><strong>Want recipes and food news emailed directly to you?

His first two books, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Empire-Death-Cultural-History-Ossuaries/dp/0500251789/\">\"The Empire of Death: A Cultural History of Ossuaries and Charnel Houses\"</a> (2011) and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Heavenly-Bodies-Treasures-Spectacular-Catacombs/dp/0500251959/\">\"Heavenly Bodies: Cult Treasures and Spectacular Saints from the Catacombs\"</a> (2013) gained popularity for their rare images of fantastic ossuaries and jeweled skeletons in Europe, mostly belonging to Catholic religious figures. Now, the final installment of his trilogy, <a href=\"http://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/memento-mori-the-dead-among-us-hardcover\">\"Memento Mori: The Dead Among Us\"</a> goes beyond the glamor and investigates how the living interacted with the everyday dead, and in some places, continue to today. </p>  <p>In conjunction with the book, the author is bringing 20 images to <a href=\"http://laluzdejesus.com/\">La Luz de Jesus</a> for a gallery show April 3 - April 26, and while his previous books and exhibits often gave us images of skeletons in painstakingly beaded attire wearing lavish jewelry, \"Memento Mori\" shows how the dead function in more secular spaces such as the caves of Indonesia and Bolivia's yearly Fiesta de las \\ufffd\\ufffdatitas, when people take beloved skulls, enshrined and decorated especially for the occasion, to a local cemetery for a celebration. \"Memento Mori\" investigates humankind's attitude towards mortality through both public and private relationships with death, and raises the question: why has death become synonymous with finality, when in reality, it is really life that is final and death that is eternal?</p>  <p>With a PhD in 17th Century Art History from UCLA, Koudounaris has always been able to give images of skulls and bones a scholarly context, bringing a rare kind of reverence and academic treatment to a subject that would otherwise seem simply ghoulish. But he says his approach has changed over time. \"I started out doing this stuff over a decade ago, and at that time I considered myself an art historian who also took photos. As I myself evolved that became reversed and I now consider myself more a photographer who does art history.\"</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/Images/CaccamoSicilyMummifiedMembersOfConfraternityofPurgatory.jpg\"><img alt=\"Mummified members of Confraternity of Purgatory in Caccamo, Sicily | Photo by Paul Koudounaris\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/assets_c/2015/03/CaccamoSicilyMummifiedMembersOfConfraternityofPurgatory-thumb-580x441-89538.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"441\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"\" /></a></p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/Images/GangiSicilyMummifiedPriests.jpg\"><img alt=\"Mummified priests in Gangi, Sicily | Photo by Paul Koudounaris\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/assets_c/2015/03/GangiSicilyMummifiedPriests-thumb-580x386-89540.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"\" /></a></p>  <p>Koudounaris says that while \"Empire of Death\" and \"Heavenly Bodies\" became famous for their photos, they were really history books. \"Memento Mori,\" in turn, is a photo book with text. \"The subject matter here is obviously similar, but the approach makes it a very different book, and also much more inclusive, since we were able to include all this wonderful material from Asia, South America, etc. It can be universal rather than Western, since we're not confined to a specific narrative.\"</p>  <p>The author can't pinpoint the specific moment he had the idea to begin working on his books about skeletons. \"All I know is that at some point, it went from being a hobby to being an obsession, and at that point, I began to realize that photographing all these dead people was slowly taking over my life; it was incumbent upon me to find a way to actually do something substantial with all this material.\"</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p>\"Memento Mori\" features photos of the Paris Catacombs, charnel houses, and modern bone memorials to victims of genocide. There are images of Catholic mummies, painted and gilded skulls, as well as skulls used as religious vessels. Perhaps the most compelling chapter on the interaction between the living and dead is about Bolivia's <em>\\ufffd\\ufffdatitas</em> (\"little pug-nosed ones\"), aka skulls which become adopted by the living. The practice dates back to indigenous ideas that the dead and living continue to coexist, but contrary to what one might expect, the skulls aren't those of friends or family members, but instead come from cemeteries where the dead's living responsible parties are late in their payments, or from medical schools and archeological sites. \"When the skull is taken as a <em>\\ufffd\\ufffdatita</em>, the spirit centralized around it will reveal an identity directly to its owner, often in dreams,\" Koudounaris writes in his book. The relationships are celebrated every November 8 during Fiesta de las \\ufffd\\ufffdatitas, when the skulls are then presented with gifts as thanks for their assistance. It brings to mind the Day of the Dead, but it's not so much a celebration or death or even of the life of the departed, but as Koudounaris writes, \"It is a celebration of a bond, one that is intimate and unique.\"</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/Images/BurgioSicilyMummifiedWoman.jpg\"><img alt=\"Mummified woman in Burgio, Sicily | Photo by Paul Koudounaris\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/assets_c/2015/03/BurgioSicilyMummifiedWoman-thumb-580x890-89536.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"890\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"\" /></a></p>  <p>Bringing Koudounaris's entire project full circle, \"Memento Mori\" ends with images of the skeletons of Christian martyrs in Roman catacombs of the 16th century through 18th century. As many of these were not able to be verified as the actual bones of martyrs, and due to their waning popularity in general, many of them were stripped of their garments and their bones disposed. \"Those that survive, however, are testaments to a different age, one in which death was not an impassable boundary, allowing the dead a vital role to play among the living,\" Koudounaris concludes his book.</p>  <p>The author recalls one of his most interesting and important discoveries he made as he was working on \"Memento Mori.\" While photographing burial caves on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, he was aware of the local tradition of dressing and displaying mummified corpses. He asked a local guide if he knew of any mummies that he could photograph, and the guide took Koudounaris to a family who had adopted the body of an unknown little girl that they found in a cave.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/Images/KeteKesuSulawesiIndonesiaSkullsOutsideBurialCave.jpg\"><img alt=\"Skulls outside burial cave in Kete Kesu, Sulawesi, Indonesia | Photo: Paul Koudounaris\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/assets_c/2015/03/KeteKesuSulawesiIndonesiaSkullsOutsideBurialCave-thumb-580x386-89542.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"\" /></a></p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/Images/KeteKesuSulawesiIndonesiaSkullWithOfferings.jpg\"><img alt=\"Skull with offerings in Kete Kesu, Sulawesi, Indonesia | Photo by Paul Koudounaris\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/assets_c/2015/03/KeteKesuSulawesiIndonesiaSkullWithOfferings-thumb-580x783-89544.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"783\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"\" /></a></p>  <p>\"I asked the guide if it was considered at all unusual to have a mummy in the home, and he told [me] by way of reply that when he was a child, his family not only kept the mummy of his grandfather in their home, but that he and his brothers would sleep in the same bed with it, and they would dress it in day clothes in the morning, take it from the bed, and place it upright against the wall, and during the evening, dress it in pajamas and lay it back down in the bed. It was just inconceivable to me, sleeping with the mummy of your grandfather. It was one of those rare times when you just have no comeback at all. I realized then that as much work as I have done on death and ritual, I am still so very westernized, [and] there are still things that can still completely shock me and give me the feeling of unease, even though for the people involved, there is nothing wrong with them whatsoever. And that's me -- I am a guy who, when it comes to this death stuff, has seen pretty nearly everything there is to see. So as a culture, we're still a very long way off from having an open attitude towards death and the disposal of the human body.\"</p>  <p>In fact, all three of Koudounaris's books bring to mind how the idea of death has shifted so dramatically before the present. Many people have lost touch with the idea of death as a transition, and have turned it into something to be feared. Perhaps more than just being a trio of macabre books on the dead, Koudounaris's work subtly asks us to take a different, more accepting approach to death. Just as \"Memento Mori\" literally means \"reminder of death,\" it's the bones themselves that serve as reminders for the living to uphold the value of life, in every part of the world. </p>  <p><em>Dr. Paul Koudounaris will be singing copies of his book at the opening reception for the \"Memento Mori\" photo exhibition on Friday, April 3, 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. at La Luz de Jesus, located at 4633 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles, CA.

And at its core is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta. Stay with <a href=\"http://kcet.org/baydelta/\">kcet.org/baydelta</a> for all the project's stories.</em></br></br></p>  <p>The Delta. The nickname for the 1,150 square mile floodplain fed by the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers may be the only simple thing about a place that, it turns out, isn't actually a delta, with islands that aren't strictly islands, and that is protected by levees that -- you guessed it -- aren't really levees. </p>  <p>Rather, trapped inland from the Pacific and San Francisco Bay behind a bottleneck strait, the Delta's mouth narrows at its ocean-most point precisely where most deltas fan out to open water. With fresh water tumbling in from the easterly rivers and its westerly border protected by this inverted arrangement from Pacific tides, generations of Delta farmers have managed to drain the region's wetlands to grow alfalfa, corn, asparagus, rice, wine grapes, and canning tomatoes. Call their farm tracts \"islands\" and an engineer will scold that they are most certainly not that. No, they are sunken \"polders\" protected from streams, rivers, and irrigation ditches by earthen mounds that the locals call \"levees.\"  But these, admonish UC Davis engineers, are not levees. They're dikes.</p>  <p>Call all those things what you will, what makes the Delta the Delta is water. After winter rain and snow, roughly half of California's fresh water arrives in this quirkily engineered, mis-named place. Twenty five million Californians depend to some degree or another on freshwater from the Delta.  Roughly a third of Southern California's supplies originate here.</p>  <p>Strangest yet for newcomers, the Delta's easterly wetlands don't seem particularly wet, at least at first glance. It's easy to drive through them on Interstate 5 without realizing that the land either side of the farm-truck heavy traffic could ever have been mistaken by an 18th century Spanish explorer for a lake. If the landscape finally speaks to the observer, it's as if a place pitted by tractors, lacerated by shipping channels, criss-crossed by power lines, mined by gas works, and bisected by highways is saying, \"You'd look like this too if Spain, Mexico, the Forty-niners and then the 31st state of the nation had all had their way with you.\"</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<div><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/california-bay-delta-history-comparison-89612.html\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/california-bay-delta-history-comparison-89612.html','popup','width=1300,height=1098,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/california-bay-delta-history-comparison-thumb-630x532-89612.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"532\" alt=\"Agricultural use has dominated what used to be a major wetland area\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></a><div class=\"htmlcaption\">, as detailed in the San Francisco Estuary Institute report \"A Delta Transformed.\" <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/california-bay-delta-history-comparison-89612.html\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/california-bay-delta-history-comparison-89612.html','popup','width=1300,height=1098,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">Click to view larger version</a>. | Image: Courtesy San Francisco Estuary Institute</div></div>  <p>Only <a href=\"http://www.sfei.org/DeltaHEStudy\">a detailed historical ecology project</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.sfei.org/\">San Francisco Estuary Institute</a> and a spin-off <a href=\"http://science.kqed.org/quest/delta-map/\">mapping project</a> by the Institute, <a href=\"http://west.stanford.edu/\">Stanford's Bill Lane Center for the American West</a>, and KQED Quest offer a glimpse of what might have been recognizable to the 300,000 indigenous people who once hunted elk, beaver, and duck among the Delta's sycamores and tule reeds.</p>  <p>The descriptor favored by engineers and newspaper reporters for the Delta is \"hub.\" Happen on a sentence to the effect that \"the Delta is the hub of California's water system\" and it's a safe bet that the writer is a member of what historian Norris Hundley, Jr. called California's \"hydraulic society.\"</p>  <p>This society began to form earlier than most timelines acknowledge. Blocking flows of rivers is done all the time. Beavers do it. Miners did it. Early Delta farmers and Sacramentans relied on it in water years that could range from 25% of anticipated flow to 200 times normal in the switch of a season. Heavy flow years, they drowned. Light ones, salty fingers from the San Francisco Bay insinuated themselves east of the protective bottleneck of Carquinez Strait. In a pure gold reprint of <a href=\"http://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerPamphlets/EP_870-1-39.pdf\">an 1874 report</a> on how Delta water might be diverted to irrigate the Central Valley, one of the modern editors noted in the introduction that, in 1850, California had six civil engineers. Twenty years later, it had 158.</p>  <p><img alt=\"As this plate from the State Water Plan of 1930 illustrates, California had enough water and it had enough land, but it didn't have them in the same places. Two years after receiving the plan, legislature voted to build a network of dams and aqueducts to correct the imbalance. However, California couldn't finance it so what became the federally operated Central Valley Project was built in stages by the federal Bureau of Reclamation and US Army Corps of Engineers as Depression-era public works projects. The Central Valley Project is now operated by Reclamation. | Image: State Water Plan of 1930.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/Geographical-Distribution-of-Water-CA-State-Water-Plan-thumb-630x720-89681.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"720\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>By 1919, the U.S. Geological Survey had put the idea of flushing Delta water\\ufffd\\ufffdinto the Central Valley to the Governor of California. By the Great Depression, a federal public works project under the Roosevelt administration began building the dams and canals that would become the federal Bureau of Reclamation's vast <a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/mp/cvp/\">Central Valley Project</a>.  Not to be outdone, by 1960 then Governor Edmund \"Pat\" Brown, father of the current governor, had matched the federal farm water system of dams and aqueducts with a massive state-run one that would wet the whistles of Southern Californians. Legislation permitting what became the State Water Project opened with the concrete-pouring agenda that defines modern California:</p>  <p>\"An aqueduct system which will provide for the transportation of water from a point or points at or near the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to termini in the Counties of Marin, Alameda, Contra Costa, Santa Clara, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Fresno, Tulare, Kings, Kern, Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Monterey and Santa Barbara Counties. Said aqueduct system shall consist of intake and diversion works, conduits, tunnels, siphons, pipelines, dams, reservoirs and pumping facilities, and shall be composed of a North Bay aqueduct extending to a terminal reservoir in Marin County; a South Bay aqueduct extending to terminal reservoirs in the Counties of Alameda and Santa Clara; a reservoir near Los Banos in Merced County; a Pacheco Pass Tunnel aqueduct from a reservoir near Los Banos in Merced County to a terminus in Pacheco Creek in Santa Clara County; a San Joaquin Valley-Southern California aqueduct extending to termini in the vicinity of Newhall, Los Angeles County, and Perris, Riverside County ...\"</p>  <p>Governor Ronald Reagan was a year away from starting the pumping plant pushing Delta water over the Tehachapi Mountains into Southern California when newly bestirred environmentalists began throwing wrench after wrench into the hub of California's hydraulic society. Pro forma assurances to Delta residents that federal and state pumps would never leave local farms with a Delta too salty or too short of irrigation supplies had been de rigueur since the 1930s and the first big federal Central Valley Project. However, in 1970, a new federal law, the National Environmental Policy Act, required that the environment be considered in permitting big new projects. Hot on the heels of NEPA came the Clean Water Act, then both state and federal versions of the Endangered Species Act. Fish had lawyers. By the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968, elk had lawyers too.</p>  <p>If the hydraulic society began to form around an 1874 report to President Grant, its unraveling may be traced to 1982, the year that California went to the polls to vote on permitting what was the yet unbuilt crown on the hub of State Water Project: the Peripheral Canal.</p>  <p>Jerry Brown, son of the State Water Project's great champion Pat Brown, was in his second term as governor. The system that his father built had made what we know as Southern California possible, but its pumps in the South Delta had problems, not least a force so great that they reversed water flows, sweeping migrating salmon off course. Water quality was a concern, too. The existing pumps at the Delta's southerly border drew the Sacramento and San Joaquin river water only after it entered the Delta and mingled with unsavory contributions of farmers, Sacramento, Stockton, and the Pacific Ocean. </p>  <p><img alt=\"The end of the hydraulic era may be traced to California's rejecting the work in this timetable in the 1982 vote on the Peripheral Canal. | State Water Plan 1978, California Department of Water Resources\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/Peripheral-Canal-timeline.jpg\" width=\"630\" height=\"548\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>The proposed peripheral canal, however, bypassed the polluters. As it was envisioned, a 43-mile-long, 400-foot-wide, 30-foot-deep aqueduct would skirt the heavily developed eastern Delta, then deliver Sacramento River water straight to State Water Project pumps in the south Delta. Most importantly, if an earthquake caused a cascade of failure among the Delta's aging levees, and seawater rushed into the wreckage of America's strangely poldered little Holland, the Central Valley and Southern California would not lose a third of their water supply for however many years it took to flush salt out of the system and rebuild the dikes.</p>  <p>If voters had merely been asked to consider the canal, chances are decent that it would have passed. However, by the time the legislative pile-on that resulted in Proposition 9 was finished, there was a lot more at stake than a two to four billion dollar aqueduct nearly the size of the Panama Canal. Who would notice a dam or two for Glenn and Tehama counties tucked in the fine print? </p>  <p><img alt=\"The 2003 biography of JG Boswell by Mark Arax and Rick Wartzman tells the story of the Central Valley cotton baron sabotaging the State Water Project's Peripheral Canal in 1982.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/king-of-california-book-boswell.jpg\" width=\"260\" height=\"390\" class=\"mt-image-right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Environmentalists would. They hated the project. Yet the blow that killed the canal may just have been provoked by the very protections built into the project for the Delta. \"The Delta comes first,\" the then-head of the state Department of Water Resources told the Los Angeles Times when explaining line items for $60 million in fish screens and salt water protection projects near the bottleneck strait. The man most exercised by this, and companion legislation protecting wild and scenic rivers, was Central Valley farmer J.G. Boswell. And so, Kern County's biggest beneficiary of the State Water Project imports set out to defeat the single thing that would have earthquake-proofed his water supply. On June 2, 1982, straight from the department of strange bedfellows, the King of Cotton's support gave Northern Californians and environmentalists a nearly two thirds majority when California vetoed the Peripheral canal.</p>  <p>In the years since the veto, California has left the hydraulic era, <a href=\"http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/report/r_211ehr.pdf\">according to the Public Policy Institute of California</a>. We may still depend on Delta water, but as we are faced with updating aging pumping plants and aqueducts, we have entered what PPIC calls an \"era of reconciliation.\" </p>  <div><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/Conceptual-map-Delta-tunnels-89652.html\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/Conceptual-map-Delta-tunnels-89652.html','popup','width=599,height=828,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\"><img src=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/Conceptual-map-Delta-tunnels-thumb-330x456-89652.jpg\" width=\"330\" height=\"456\" alt=\"The revised version of the Peripheral Canal, now an underground project called the Dual Delta Water Conveyance (often referred as the twin tunnels), is still on the drawing board as it undergoes state and federal environmental review.\" class=\"mt-image-right\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;\" /></a><div class=\"htmlcaption\"><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/Conceptual-map-Delta-tunnels-89652.html\" onclick=\"window.open('http://www.kcet.org/news/redefine/rewater/assets_c/2015/03/Conceptual-map-Delta-tunnels-89652.html','popup','width=599,height=828,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false\">Click to view larger version</a> | Map: Courtesy U.S. Bureau of Reclamation</div></div>  <p>Again, Jerry Brown is governor. Again he is seeking to complete the State Water Project with a northern diversion on the Sacramento River. Except this time the proposal is for twin tunnels that would burrow 150 feet beneath the heavily developed eastern Delta. This time the fish screens would be even better designed. And this time there will be even more layers of the kind of Delta restoration elements that drove J.G. Boswell into the arms of the Sierra Club.</p>  <p>Will it be built? Not if residents in most of the five counties surrounding the Delta have a say. Contra Costa County, which is entirely dependent on the Delta, does not want Los Angeles to have first draw on the Sacramento River. Delta alfalfa growers would cheerfully see every single almond grower in the Central Valley rip out tree crops and wait patiently to plant fallowable annuals in good water years. Speak to Delta farmers of habitat restoration and they point to their fields and claim birds and fish do just fine around their islands and levees. </p>  <p>Meanwhile, here in the Southland, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is, as it was in 1982, the single greatest champion of today's version of the Peripheral Canal. Again, it is still, warily, hoping for support on the tunnels from, in many cases, the same screw-fish farmers who, with Boswell, turned on the Southland in 1982. As it again pushes for a Delta bypass system, it has drawn up disaster plans for when the levees fail and Southern California loses a third of its water supply for what it estimates could be three years.</p>  <p><img alt=\"In the 1960s, California answered the federal Bureau of Reclamation with its own aqueduct system serving the Central Valley and Southern California.

This time Southern Californian cities and Central Valley farmers using the State Water Project are being asked to build the tunnels with only one guarantee of how much water will be allowed to go into them. That guarantee is uncertainty. They will get their legal share of how ever much water happens to be available any given year. If drought has proved one thing to regions greened by aqueducts built during the hydraulic era, it's that the Delta's water needs have legal precedence. In the last eight years, the state's Department of Water Resources <a href=\"http://www.water.ca.gov/news/newsreleases/2015/030215allocation.pdf\">has not once met the allocation</a> a full flow year might provide for the aqueduct system serving Southern California's cities. Last year, the allocation was only 5 per cent. This year, barring a late season bonanza, the allocation will be 20 percent.</p>  <p>In coming weeks, we'll introduce readers to the groups now being dragged kicking and screaming by an exasperated governor toward reconciliation. In the meantime, remember, we're in a drought. Only flush when it's brown. Ah, and Delta tracts are not islands. They're polders.</p>]]>     </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>The New Chinatown</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/the-nosh/the-new-chinatown-los-angeles.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/living/food//1240.80812</id>      <published>2015-03-17T23:25:42Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-18T16:56:32Z</updated>      <summary>Chinatown is becoming L.A.&apos;s most interesting culinary neighborhood.

There's usually a background of corrupt political manuevering and a whole lot of violence. L.A.'s Chinatown also has a half-glamorous, half-sad Hollywood history: the neighborhood's second iteration was essentially a movie set, a theme park of sorts that tourists could visit and easily forget that it was home to many of the servers and dancers working to entertain them. (We can't entirely blame those guileless tourists, though. Many of the storefronts had been<a href=\"mailto:http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/production-notes/lights-camera-chinatown.html\"> used as sets</a> on the 1937 film The Good Earth.)</p>  <p>Chinatown is also where many people experience Chinese food for the first time. Almost all Angeleno lifers have memories of late-night slippery shrimp at Yang Chow and family lunches at Empress Pavilion. But for the past twenty years or so, Chinatown's restaurants have lost their destination status as the San Gabriel Valley has grown and L.A. diners have become more sophisticated -- they'll now venture out to the eastern reaches of the county to find the best<a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/food/the-nosh/have-you-eaten/regional-chinese-food-guide-to-los-angeles.html\"> regional Chinese cuisine in the U.S.</a></p>  <p><b>To learn more about the new Chinatown -- and what \"gentrification\" means for this neighborhood -- listen to my talk with Madeleine Brand on <a href=\"http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/press-play-with-madeleine-brand/venice-high-school-arrests-wikipedias-feminist-makeover-and-chinatown\">KCRW Press Play</a>. Segment starts at 40:35.</b></p>  <p>So what's going on with all the neglected kitchens in Chinatown now? Well, they're seeing some action again, but they're not serving lo mein and lacquered duck. L.A.'s latest iteration of Chinatown is eclectic, international, and for the most part, quite delicious. Here are some of the latest arrivals:</p>  <p><strong><a href=\"http://littlejewel.la/\">Little Jewel of New Orleans</a></strong>: Chef Marcus Christiana-Beniger cited cheap rent and proximity to \"Thai Costco\" (officially named LAX-C) as two compelling reasons to open in Chinatown. His Louisiana-style deli offers house-made sausages and all manner of po' boys. (Its location across the street from banh mi cult favorite My Dung is making Ord Street sandwich heaven.) Having never been to New Orleans I can't speak to authenticity, but I'd eat Little Jewel's shrimp po' boy forever.   </p>  <p><strong><a href=\"http://eatchego.com/\">Chego</a></strong>: Roy Choi has a proven knack for sussing out new culinary trends, and moving his Korean-inspired rice bowl shop from the westside to Chinatown a couple years ago is just another example. The food is hearty and very L.A. (spicy sauces, Pacific Rim ingredient mash-ups). Perhaps more importantly, Choi has been instrumental in bringing this new cohort to the neighborhood. </p>  <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"4\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/z8wCecPsy-/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_top\">Noodles and seafood @pokpokpdx in LA. #padthai #thaifood #chinatown</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by KCET Living (@kcetliving) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2015-03-08T02:02:19+00:00\">Mar 7, 2015 at 6:02pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async defer src=\"//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\"></script> <a href=\"http://www.pokpokphatthaila.com/\"><strong>Pok Pok Phat Thai</strong></a>: An Oregon-based Thai restaurant chain owned by a white guy opening in L.A.?

The rest of the world is abloom. What's more, immediate succession planting is done around Southern California all the time. However, unless the successor plant is a summer vegetable, it's always wrong. </p>  <p>Plant right away and remnant seeds and roots of the grass you've just removed will be awakened by the water you intend for the new stock. You may never disentangle their warring root systems. Above all, as what's left of the grass breaks down, your soil is still in conversion. It needs time. And so do you. Once the hard work of lawn removal is done and you're overseeing the soil conversion and weeding recurring grass, it's time to go back to square one of this series. </p>  <p>That is to say that this is the time to think. The questions are still: What do you want? Where do you want it? What will do well? What won't? How much water and maintenance will it take? To help answer those questions, to my mind, these are the best six books.</p>  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-New-Western-Garden-Book/dp/0376039205\">The New Sunset Western Garden Book</a></em></strong> If a gardener uses USDA climate zones instead of sunset ones, they are not from the West. This continually refreshed encyclopedia for western gardeners is perhaps the first book anyone new to the region should buy.</p>  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/California-Native-Plants-Garden-Bornstein/dp/0962850586\">California Native Plants for the Garden</a></em></strong> Plants we love on hikes might not work in our gardens. The three co-authors of this book -- Bart O'Brien, a former horticulture director from Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden; Carol Bornstein a former director at the Santa Barbara Botanic Garden; and David Fross, a founder of Native Sons Nursery -- have dedicated their professional lives to selecting the most beautiful manzanitas, lilacs, grasses, sages, and vines from our native flora and developing durable, beautiful, and compact cultivars for our home gardens. A classic. </p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/homegarden/afterthelawn5_3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"500\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Landscape-Plants-California-Gardens-Robert/dp/0960598855\">Landscape Plants for California Gardens</a></em></strong> Only this book by USC School of Architecture professor Robert Perry prepares you to plant a new garden with full understanding of compatible plant sizes, color palettes, durability, and water budgets.</p>  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Drip-Irrigation-Every-Landscape-Climates/dp/0961584823\">Drip Irrigation for Every Landscape and All Climates</a></em></strong> The argument may be on-going about which kind of irrigation is best for plants -- drip irrigation or overhead sprinkling -- but drought is settling the score. If our gardens are going to keep going, drip will have to win.  Robert Kourik, a plantsman who literally took his study back to how plant roots work, is the author I trust for those about to turn from sprinklers to drip.</p>  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Rainwater-Harvesting-Drylands-Beyond-Vol/dp/0977246418\">Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond</a></em></strong> The world is coming around to Brad Lancaster's way of thinking when it comes to simple steps that we all should be taking to maximize benefits of fleeting rains. He may look like a New Age desert hippie, but he thinks like a scientist and he has a garden aesthetic that would please Vita Sackville-West herself.</p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p></p>  <p><strong><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Succulents-Debra-Lee-Baldwin/dp/088192816X\">Designing with Succulents</a></em></strong> Anyone reading this series will have detected concern that we've gone too far in the succulent direction. I wonder if that concern would exist if more people had the understanding of how to use them demonstrated in this book by the San Diego-based garden writer Debra Lee Baldwin. Follow her instructions and you will not end up with a gravel pit.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/homegarden/afterthelawn5_2.JPG\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>For those with lawn gone but soil still in conversion, spring and summer aren't just tortuous intervals in which we must sit patiently inside studying gardening books. It's tour time. There's no sweeter path to inspiration than stealing a beautiful idea from a designer on the Mar Vista or Theodore Payne tours. Heat willing, this is also the season to take classes. Even buy tomato plants or succulents if the waiting is too much. Just please, please, please don't buy any plant that can't feed you in the months leading up to fall, or wait patiently in its pot until next November before you put it in the ground.</p>  <p><strong>TOURS/SHOWS</strong></p>  <p><em>Los Angeles County</em></p>  <p>April 19: <a href=\"http://www.rsabg.org/garden-events/1012-claremont-garden-tour\">Claremont Eclectic: A Tour of Six Local Gardens</a>, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, Claremont<br /> March 21-25: <a href=\"http://www.nativeplantgardentour.org/\">Theodore Payne Native Garden Tour</a>, Los Angeles County, many locations<br /> April 25: <a href=\"http://marvistagreengardenshowcase.blogspot.com/\">Mar Vista Green Garden Showcase</a>, Mar Vista</p>  <p><em> Orange County</em></p>  <p>April 23-26 <a href=\"http://www.springgardenshow.com/\">Southern California Spring Garden Show</a>, South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br /> May 2-3: <a href=\"http://www.heardsgardentour.com/\">Mary Lou Heard Memorial Garden Tour</a>, Long Beach to San Clemente</p>  <p><em> San Diego County</em></p>  <p>April 10-14: <a href=\"http://www.pacifichorticulture.org/tours/spring-break-in-san-diego/\">Spring Break in San Diego</a>, Pacific Horticulture, San Diego<br /> April 11: Visit to Patrick Anderson's Garden with plants from South Africa, Australia and other Mediterranean climates, <a href=\"http://www.mediterraneangardensociety.org/branches-us-cal-south.html\">Mediterranean Garden Society</a>, Fallbrook<br /> April 28-29: San Diego: <a href=\"http://www.cnpssd.org/tour/\">California Native Plant Society Native Garden Tour</a>, San Diego</p>  <p><strong>PLANT SALES</strong></p>  <p><em>Los Angeles County </em></p>  <p>March 28: Tomato Mania!

opera composed by Lisa Bielawa on a libretto by Erik Ehn and directed by Charles Otte, featuring 16-year-old soprano Rowen Sabala. A collaborative project of KCET and Cal State Fullerton's Grand Central Art Center, <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/projects/vireo/\">Vireo</a> is being created expressly for episodic release via broadcast and online media, airing on KCET's Artbound March 31 at 8 pm. </em></p>  <p>Western history's read on hysteria is long and fraught, fascinating and powerful. Hysteria is almost always associated with the female mind and/or body, and mention of it calls to mind a plethora of images and concepts, such as witchcraft, the relationship between photography and psychiatry in the late 19th century, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman's novella \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" about a woman who loses her mind when confined inside. Depictions of hysteria abound in films such as Roman Polanski's 1965 psychological thriller <em><a href=\"http://www.criterion.com/films/404-repulsion\">Repulsion</a></em>, a portrait of Carol's (Catherine Deneuve) devolvement into solitary madness that is portrayed as \"the dark side of female innocence\" as imagined by men, and the 1922 film <em>H\\ufffd\\ufffdxan: Witchcraft Through the Ages</em> which traces notions of witchcraft and sorcery back to the times of primitive man. </p>  <p>Hysteria histories live on today in <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/orange/vireo-lisa-bielawa-orange-county.html\">\"Vireo: The Spiritual Biography of a Witch's Accuser,\"</a> an episodic opera created by composer Lisa Bielawa with libretto by Erik Ehn. Inspired by a combination of the Yost Theater, the Orange County School of the Arts (OCSA) and, yes, the TV sitcom \"Arrested Development,\" Bielawa envisioned an opera that was to be viewed on a screen -- either online or on TV --\\ufffd\\ufffdand releases it in an episodic, micro-chapter-like format. She focuses on female hysteria through the ages, a project she began researching more than 20 years ago as an undergraduate at Yale. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Rowen Sabala in &quot;Vireo&quot; | Photo: Remsen Allard\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Vireo7_RowenSabala_byRemsenAllard_580.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>What began for Bielawa as a senior thesis turned into a fascination with the fact that groups of men of medicine, religion and art (specifically, the Surrealists) repeatedly authored studies on the visions of teenage girls. Even as a young undergraduate, Bielawa realized that this was more than a research paper -- it had to be something much, much bigger because hysteria and the female body continue to fascinate people of all genders. </p>  <p>\"Hysteria was eerie for physicians and philosophers, as it was for patients; it was continually blurring boundaries between medical categories -- mind and body, doctor and patient, pathology and normality,\" writes Sander L. Gilman in the book <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=LdxmV5J0pPkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+hysteria&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wHbuVI70F4mwggShjIG4Bw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20hysteria&f=false\">\"Hysteria After Freud\"</a>. \"Hysteria calls into question basic oppositions between reality and representation.\" </p>  <p>Hippocrates' 4th and 5th century writings reveal the earliest recordings of the term \"wandering womb,\" which became known as hysteria. Hippocrates believed that womens' health problems were caused by the internal floating of the uterus, which closely resembled \"an animal.\" He thought that this moving uterus caused serious illness in women, including vertigo, headaches, and sleeplessness. The Greeks and Romans referred to <a href=\"http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0p3003d3&chunk.id=d0e760\">practically every female complaint</a> as hysteria, crediting these maladies to a wandering uterus. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Spasms in hysterical patients | Source: Wellcome Images\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Spasms_in_hysterical_patients_Wellcome_580.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"363\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>From the Renaissance to the current day, hysteria has been read primarily as a female diagnosis. The Renaissance-era created <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=LdxmV5J0pPkC&pg=PA192&dq=hysteria+renaissance&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BfsFVc_OBtWxogTq8IHQDg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=renaissance&f=false\">gendered binary oppositions</a> established as hysteria (female) and melancholy (male), which set the groundwork for ongoing gendered definitions of hysteria. In G.S. Rousseau's essay \"A Strange Pathology: Hysteria in the Early Modern World, 1500-1800,\" he discusses the binary nature of hysteria: </p>  <blockquote>\"For men, a cycle was thus set up of erotic infatuation, unrequited love, love sickness, anger, and, finally, melancholy. Hysteria was preempted: nowhere did the sexual organs enter into the sequence, nor was there space for priapic phalluses or morbidly wandering scrotums.\"</blockquote>  <p>Indeed, throughout the ages there seemed to be no such masculine equivalent of the feminine hysteria. </p>  <p>The Renaissance \"wandering uterus\" was also closely aligned with witchery. In the 1483 text <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em> or the <em>Hammer of Witches</em>, written by <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=66H_bRK5JJQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wandering+uterus&hl=en&sa=X&ei=La8EVc6_K8_0oATS94DgDw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&q=witch&f=false\">two church \"experts\" on witchcraft</a>, the two men laid out rules for determining a witch; women were hanged, burned, and murdered in other torturous ways according to the book. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Series inspired by French neurologist Jean Martin Charcot studies in Neurosis. Charcot (1825-1893) used hypnotism to treat hysteria and other abnormal mental conditions and he had a profound influence on many farther neurologists, psychologists and psychotherapists as Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), father of psychoanalysis. | Source: Wikipedia Commons\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Jean-Martin_Charcot_Hysteria_chronophotography_580.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"580\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>The famous 1692 Salem Witch Trials saw the execution of 19 men and women accused of witchcraft, <a href=\"http://www.salemwitchmuseum.com/education/\">citing it</a> as the reason that the daughter and niece of Salem Village's Reverend Samuel Parris had fallen ill and not improved. Many Salem residents believed strongly in the devil; witches were originally seen as healers, but when they could not perform healings it was said that they were the ones that <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=66H_bRK5JJQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wandering+uterus&hl=en&sa=X&ei=La8EVc6_K8_0oATS94DgDw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=snippet&q=witch&f=false\">caused such illness</a> in the first place. </p>  <p>The witch had great power, including ruining farmers' cattle, spreading diseases, making men impotent, starting storms, selling unbaptized souls to the devil, and causing miscarriages; they were often times promiscuous and super sexual. Such power was accredited to the womb.  </p>  <p>Elaine Showalter's essay <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=LdxmV5J0pPkC&pg=PA192&dq=hysteria+renaissance&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BfsFVc_OBtWxogTq8IHQDg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=hysteria%2Fmelancholy&f=false\">\"Hysteria, Feminism, Gender\"</a> traces the coded genders of hysteria through the ages. In the 17th and 18th centuries, we see such distinctions again as hysteria and hypochondria, which were also associated with melancholy; <a href=\"http://loki.stockton.edu/~kinsellt/projects/pom/storyReader$7.html\">18th-century theories</a> of melancholy and hysteria characterized it as \"conditions of deep sadness and lethargic behaviors\" that led to delusion and, at times, suicide. </p>  <p>The late 19th century brought up the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/09/books/hysteria-was-for-women-neurasthenia-for-men.html\">gendered variation of hysteria/neurasthenia</a>, characterizing hysteria as an eccentric, bizarre and performative nature reserved for women, while men suffered from the quieter, anxiety-ridden neurasthenia. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Louise Bourgeois, &quot;Arch of Hysteria,&quot; 1993. | Courtesy Louise Bourgeois Studio (New York).\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Louise-Bourgeois-Arch-of-Hysteria-1993.jpg\" width=\"512\" height=\"397\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Victorian asylums in London often performed hysterectomies, or removal of the \"afflicted organ,\" or the wandering womb. The mid-19th century also saw the creation of establishments such as hydros, spas, sanatoria, and nursing homes for the treatment of hysteria. One could say that the 1800s characterized a major focus on the study of hysteria. It wasn't until centuries later that feminist histories would begin to look at the social oppression of women, acknowledging its implications for the hysteria diagnosis.</p>  <p>During World War I, this shifted into hysteria/shell shock, the later of which accounted for the neurosis men faced upon <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9057.html\">returning home from war</a>, following the formula that women stayed home in the domestic realm while men fought the good fight. Yet a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/world-war-ones-forgotten-female-shell-shock-victims/378995/\">2014 article</a> in <em>The Atlantic</em> discusses a British woman named Elizabeth Huntley who had a nervous breakdown during an air raid in London, after which she decapitated and murdered her child. This incident was referred to as \"air raid shock\" -- a variation on shell-shock, not hysteria. Normally this psychoanalytic term was reserved for soldiers returning home from the war, leaving women's reactions to the age-old \"hysteria\" diagnosis. </p>  <p>Historians today argue that the shell shock diagnosis offered a way for doctors to separate the mental traumas of soldiers from the feminine-gendered hysteria even though many women exhibited shell-shock symptoms, and many women worked alongside male soldiers. Psychologists and doctors of the time period invented the term \"civilian war neuroses\" to account for some of the shell-shock-like symptoms that non-soldiers experienced. But clearly the gendered associations of hysteria weren't holding up. </p>  <p><iframe width=\"580\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iO0niGPR5S4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>  <p>Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, discusses hysteria as part of the feminine. Freud used talk therapy to treat his patient <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/sigmundfreud/p/freud_women.htm\">Bertha Pappenheim</a> (popularly known as Anna O.) who suffered from hysteria. Her symptoms included amnesia and hallucinations, among others; in their work together, Pappenheim described her feelings and experiences, which it was said helped alleviate her \"hysteria\" symptoms. Freud's beliefs on hysteria differed from Hippocrates; rather than rooting them in the female body, Freud saw hysteria as centering in the mind. He initially believed hysteria was a result of childhood sexual abuse, yet later ditched that theory for one that focused on sexual fantasies in relation to neuroses. </p>  <p>Throughout history, massaging \"hysterical\" female patients to orgasm was the most commonly known \"treatment,\" a topic discussed at length in Rachel P. Maines' book <a href=\"https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/technology-orgasm\">The Technology of Orgasm</a>. If hysteria was seen as the result of sexual deprivation, doctors relieved these \"symptoms\" through various modes of inducing orgasms, either through vibrators or hiring a midwife. The diagnosis of \"hysteria\" similarly saw female sexuality as a disease -- hence the ongoing contemporary fascination with hysteria from feminist intellectuals, literary critics and artists. </p>  <p>In the women's liberation movement of the late 1960s, feminist intellectuals, writers and critics in Europe took theories of hysteria and began looking to Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis for a theory of femininity, sexuality, and sexual difference. </p>  <p><iframe width=\"580\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZzKvBT0KHE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>  <p>By removing hysteria from a purely essentialist gendered approach of \"the female,\" it's possible to consider hysteria through gender. In this approach, hysteria in men is similarly regarded as shameful and \"effeminate,\" a disease of \"weak, overly emotional\" people regardless of gender. People of the medical fields and culture workers alike continue to investigate the vast history of hysteria.  </p>  <p><a href=\"http://blog.art21.org/2012/07/24/centerfield-an-interview-with-terri-kapsalis/#.VPN2ayldWrb\">Artist Terry Kapsalis'</a> course \"Wandering Uterus: Journeys through Gender and Medicine,\" a class that's received a cult-like status at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, seeks to first understand the hysteria of hysteria, from there moving on to examine the history of gynecological experimentation on slave women, history and politics of birth control, and health care for LGBTQI people. Kapsalis' course also delves into the darker history of hysteria, including a look at clitoridectomy, which was once seen as a 19th century \"treatment\" for mental illness, as well as ideas about sexual dysfunction. <br /> </p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p><img alt=\"Cover from Terry Kapsalis' collaborative project, &quot;The Hysteria Alphabet&quot;\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/hysterical.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"536\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Terry Kapsalis, &quot;Jane Addams' Travel Medicine Kit&quot;\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/kitbookinsitu.72dpi.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"435\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>In her art practice, <a href=\"http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/terrikapsalis\">Kapsalis</a> has produced works such as <em>The Hysteria Alphabet</em> (WhiteWalls), a Victorian-style children's book made in collaboration with Gina Litherland, and the \"Jane Addams' Travel Medicine Kit,\" in which the artist creates a new label for noted women's suffragist Addams' three-inch leather pouch that contained two vials of medicine, both unknown. Kapsalis chose Addams because the famous women's suffragist movement leader was once treated for hysteria by S. Weir Mitchell, the same physician that worked with <a href=\"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/literatureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf\">\"The Yellow Wallpaper\"</a> author Charlotte Perkins Gilman. If Kapsalis' ongoing research is any indication, hysteria's history remains a deeply ingrained aspect of the Western psyche.</p>  <p>Contemporary artists like Louise Bourgeois, who was in analysis for more than 30 years and self-identified as hysteric, considered her work \"Arch of Hysteria\" (1993) as one born out of hysteria. Her artwork was a channel to the unconscious, and she viewed it as her own form of psychoanalysis, psychological release, and mental healing, according to an article in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/apr/06/louise-bourgeois-freud\">The Guardian</a>. </p>  <p>The history of hysteria in Western medicine, and its subsequent representations in film and visual art suggests an ongoing fascination with this subject. Like Bielawa's vision for \"Vireo: The Spiritual Biography of a Witch's Accuser\" -- in which she allows the story to reveal itself in shorter segments onscreen beginning in the 1590s and ending in present-day Stockholm, and broadcast to the world -- it's not possible to view the history of hysteria in a single chunk of time; rather, its episodic-like nature.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Dig this story? <a href=\"http://kcet.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c2be079f33ff6f73d5571f3ac&id=a379363cac\">Sign up</a> for our newsletter to get unique arts & culture stories and videos from across Southern California in your inbox.

Oftentimes, this is all it needs to unclog on its own as the soap loosens the obstruction and moves it right along.</p>  <p>If after thirty minutes you haven't heard the telltale gurgle of your toilet flushing, heat a large pot of water to <em>just</em> before a simmer on the stove. Do not let it boil, as scalding hot water can crack a porcelain toilet bowl.</p>  <p>By now, your toilet has likely drained at least halfway down. Stand above the bowl and pour the very hot water down the toilet from waist level. It might seem counterintuitive to put more water on top of water when there's a clog, but the Niagara Falls-like force of water rushing down, combined with the heat and soap (which effectively break down matter) work to clear most obstructions from the toilet trap.</p>  <p>Your toilet should automatically drain on its own after this, but very stubborn clogs may need a second or even third douse of hot water.</p>  <p>As a bonus, your bathroom will smell nice and fresh from the soap flushing!</p>]]>              </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Vietnamese-American Community Welcomes the New Year</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/el-monte/vietnamese-american-community-welcomes-the-new-year.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/socal/departures//25.80837</id>      <published>2015-03-17T17:33:23Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-18T20:05:04Z</updated>      <summary>Vietnamese community celebrates cultural heritage and Lunar New Year in the San Gabriel Valley.</summary>     <author>         <name>Connie K.

For visitors at Whittier Narrows Regional Park in El Monte, there was a plethora of sights and sounds to take in. The theme from this year's program was \"The Return of Golden Harvest\" and thousands, from Greater Los Angeles and Orange County, flocked to the park to take part in the festivities. The festival is just one component of the multi-faceted Vietnamese community in El Monte and South El Monte.</p>  <p>Hosted this past month, the weekend-long program included firecrackers, a fashion show, games and other activities. </p>  <p>\"'Tet' means lunar new year in the Vietnamese language,\" said Annie B. Nguyen, one of the festival organizers. \"[It's] an opportunity to celebrate the new year and share the rich heritage of our people through food, music and cultural activities. It is a good opportunity for family members to get together.\"</p>  <p>The first Tet celebration was in held in 2003 to promote Vietnamese cultural traditions.</p>  <p><img alt=\"L.A.Tet Festival Beauty Pageant.

Tet Festival is not only a celebration of the new year but also a chance for the Vietnamese community as a whole to reflect upon the past and look forward to blessings in the future,\" said Nguyen.</p>  <p>In the center of the park, a stage was set up for a variety of performances, including traditional dances and live music.</p>  <p>\"The Vietnamese music that was presented is often poetic or patriotic,\" Nguyen said. \"Songs are often reflective of love for family, friends, community and country.\"</p>  <p>Food was also a big part of the festival with a range of culinary styles on display. The aroma of Korean barbeque wafted across the field as attendees sipped on boba drinks and noshed on delectable finger foods. Booth upon booth served up special dishes, including house special porridge, noodles, and rice cakes. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Food booths offer a range of Vietnamese culinary styles.Photo by Connie Ho.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/Tet%20foodbooths.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>Data from the United States Census Bureau show a strong contingent of Vietnamese immigrants in El Monte and South El Monte. In 2010, Asians accounted for 25.1 percent of the population (with 7.4 percent identifying as Vietnamese) in South El Monte and accounted for 11 percent of the population (with 3.8 percent identifying as Vietnamese) in South El Monte.</p>  <p>Vietnamese American Kenneth Nguyen, a local business owner, has seen the change in demographics. He attended Don Bosco Tech in Rosemead in the 1970s and now lives in Alhambra. Growing up in the San Gabriel Valley, he was surrounded by a predominantly white and Latino community.</p>  <p>\"Asian kids growing up at that time weren't the majority and, not being the majority, it was a little hard having to deal with bullying and being pushed around,\" Nguyen said. \"I have definitely seen the shift in San Gabriel, Monterey Park, Alhambra area - there's been a huge push of Chinese people which wasn't like that when I was growing up.\"</p>  <p>These days, he has friends from all walks of life and doesn't aim to distinguish them through a racial lens.</p>  <p>\"In the early days, when I was growing up in the 70s and 80s, I kind of had to choose,\" said Nguyen on defining Asian American identities. \"I feel like it's no longer like that for Asian kids - they have a healthy sense of being Asian American, full on American, not biased the way I had it when I was growing up.\"</p>  <p>Vinh Nguyen, pastor of El Monte Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church, has also noticed the shifts in the Vietnamese community in El Monte and South El Monte over the past few years. His church aims to provide services for immigrants with a Vietnamese language school and a community health fair. His organization also offers services in English and Vietnamese, attracting both new immigrants and those who were born in the U.S. According to an ethnographic guide on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the fall of Saigon in 1975, the Vietnamese have immigrated and resettled to other countries. In the U.S., this was marked by the 1975-era refugees, the \"boat people\" and minority groups (including Ameriasians and ethnic Chinese-Vietnamese).</p>  <p><img alt=\"Celebration of cultural heritage and welcoming the New Year. Photo by Connie Ho.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/columns/Tet%20Stage.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /></p>  <p>Today, El Monte and South El Monte, offers an abundance of services and businesses that cater to the Vietnamese and Vietnamese-American community and has sprouted numerous noteworthy Vietnamese restaurants, particularly along Garvey Ave. </p>  <p>According to Cathy Chaplin, a food writer who pens the blog \"Gastronomy,\" there are more and more restaurants with Vietnamese cuisine in the area. She first became acquainted with this culinary hub when a new job in the area prompted her lunchtime explorations of El Monte.</p>  <p>\"I can't attest to what the neighborhood used to be like, but the stretch of Garvey starting at Walnut Grove heading east is a current hotbed for Vietnamese restaurants,\" said Chaplin, a Vietnamese-American based in Pasadena.</p>  <p>Chaplin ventures to the Vietnamese restaurants along Garvey for lunch as often as she can. </p>  <p>\"My favorite restaurant is Kim Hoa Hue, a low-key place specializing in Central Vietnamese fare. The baby clam rice (com hen) is especially noteworthy,\" Chaplin said.</p>  <p>And while Vietnamese cuisine attracts culinary explorers like Chaplin into the area, the L.A. Tet Festival is an opportunity for thousands to come together to appreciate Vietnamese culture, pay tribute to the ancestors and welcome the New Year. </p>]]>              </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Video Captures Majesty, Mystery of Joshua Tree </title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/national-park/video-captures-majesty-mystery-of-joshua-tree.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/living/travel/socal_wanderer//1376.80762</id>      <published>2015-03-17T17:28:03Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-17T19:22:59Z</updated>      <summary>Two brothers plan to make short films of all 59 National Parks.  </summary>     <author>         <name>Rick Paulas</name>         <uri>http://www.kcet.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;blog_id=1376&amp;id=5015</uri>     </author>              <category term=\"National Parks\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />          <category term=\"filmmaking\" label=\"filmmaking\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"joshuatree\" label=\"joshua tree\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"morethanjustparks\" label=\"More Than Just Parks\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"nationalparks\" label=\"national parks\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"shortfilms\" label=\"short films\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"video\" label=\"video\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />          <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/\">         <![CDATA[<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/image/assets/joshuatreevide.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">Photo:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/45935274@N00/16254814591/\">x_tine</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></div></div>  <p>If you've ever had the pleasure of driving through Joshua Tree National Park, then you know how there's just something <em>different</em> about that area of the world. The edges are a little crisper, the sunsets a little sharper, and the stars seems just a tad closer. It's not surprising, then, that the park has been used in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Joshua+Tree+National+Park%2C+Twentynine+Palms%2C+California%2C+USA\">a whole bunch of films</a>. </p>  <p>Its latest starring role, though, isn't for Hollywood. It's for an independent project called <a href=\"http://www.morethanjustparks.com/\">More Than Just Parks</a>, which is attempting to bring awareness to America's National Parks by filming short gorgeous-looking videos of all 59 of them. (They've got a ways to go: besides Joshua Tree, they've filmed Great Smoky Mountain National Park, Olympic National Park, and... that's it.) </p>  <p>The project is the work of filmmaking brothers Will and Jim Pattiz, who spent nearly a month exploring Joshua Tree National Park with their video camera: </p>  <blockquote>We chose Joshua Tree because of its unique landscape. Its immense boulder piles, colorful cactus fields, endless desert expanses, and one-of-a-kind Joshua trees make for a spectacular setting.</blockquote>  <p>Here, then, is what they came away with:</p>  <p><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/120995492\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></p>  <p>If you're interested in helping to fund the project, <a href=\"https://www.morethanjustparks.com/about\">visit the website for more information</a>. </p>]]>              </content> </entry>   <entry>     <title>Soak In Escalen&apos;s Hot Springs In Big Sur On The Cheap </title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/outdoors/soak-in-escalens-hot-springs-on-the-cheap.html\" />     <id>tag:www.kcet.org,2015:/living/travel/socal_wanderer//1376.80719</id>      <published>2015-03-17T17:26:43Z</published>     <updated>2015-03-18T19:03:11Z</updated>      <summary>Night owls can take advantage of the gorgeous Big Sur hot springs&apos; cheaper entry fee. </summary>     <author>         <name>Rick Paulas</name>         <uri>http://www.kcet.org/cgi-bin/mt/mt-cp.cgi?__mode=view&amp;blog_id=1376&amp;id=5015</uri>     </author>              <category term=\"Outdoors\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#category\" />          <category term=\"bigsur\" label=\"big sur\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"escaleninstitute\" label=\"escalen institute\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"hotsprings\" label=\"hot springs\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />     <category term=\"retreatcenter\" label=\"retreat center\" scheme=\"http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag\" />          <content type=\"html\" xml:lang=\"en\" xml:base=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/\">         <![CDATA[<div><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/living/travel/socal_wanderer/image/assets/esalen.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" class=\"mt-image-none\" style=\"\" /><div class=\"htmlcaption\">Photo:<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ocook/7831884456/sizes/z/in/photostream/\">ocook</a>/Flickr/<a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\">Creative Commons License</a></div></div>  <p>The Escalen Institute in Big Sur is one of those places that defies labels. Overlooking the cliffs and surf, it describes itself as \"not only a retreat center or an educational institute,\" but also \"a world-wide network of seekers who look beyond dogma to explore deeper spiritual possibilities.\" In other words, it's a hippie-centric place to find your chakras, meditate, and maybe \"re-find your center.\" </p>  <p>If you want to stay there for a workshop, it can be pricey. The cheapest accommodations <a href=\"http://www.esalen.org/page/esalen-workshop-tuition-including-accommodations\">are $405 for a weekend</a>, and that's only if you're willing to stay off-site or in a sleeping bag. But, there is a way to use the hot springs for cheap. (And no, not by breaking in and donning a disguise that <em>certainly</em> would include a fake mustache and cane.) </p>  <p>You need to be a night owl. </p>  <p>See, every night between 1 a.m. and 3 a.m., Escalen opens its doors to the public for $25 a person.

Los Angeles-based and proudly rebellious, Williams has consistently stuck a chord with youth-centric subcultures that have sprouted from Southern California since the mid-20th century. He got his start working for Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth, keeping him forever tied to custom car culture. He was part of the team behind Zap Comix, the underground imprint tied to the counterculture of the 1960s. A decade or so later, when punk hit Los Angeles, Williams was a part of that too, showing his work at after-hours events.</p>  <p>Williams spent decades sewing the seeds of art revolution among the groups that the high-brow world ignored. Hot rod enthusiasts, skaters, suffers, bikers, hippies and punks have long bean his people. By the time Williams co-founded Juxtapoz in the mid-1990s, all these influences had come together to impact a large and healthy community of artists who similarly found their voices in representational art with strong narrative elements. \"The art talks to you and it talks to you in a voice that has been inadvertently silenced for almost 70 years,\" says Williams inside his home library. </p>  <p>Inside Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery at Barnsdall Park, Williams' solo show <a href=\"http://www.barnsdall.org/2015/01/02/robert-williams-slang-aesthetics-20-years-influence-juxtapoz/\">\"Slang Aesthetics!\"</a> takes up the larges spaces at the center of the venue. An expansive collection of works, the show includes paintings, drawings, prints and two mammoth statues. Framing the exhibition is the concurrent show, \"20 Years Under the Influence of Juxtapoz,\" a collection of artists affiliated with the styles that the magazine has long championed. Featuring works by Shag, Natalia Fabia, Elizabeth McGrath and many others, it's a who's-who of the movement often referenced as pop surrealism.</p>  <p><a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/Williams_Decline%20of%20Sophistication.jpg\"><img alt=\"&quot;Decline of Sophistication&quot; by Robert Williams\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/assets_c/2015/03/Williams_Decline of Sophistication-thumb-600x790-89198.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"790\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></a></p>  <p>In the early 1960s, when Williams was an art student and new to Los Angeles, this gallery hosted a show from the surrealist Salvador Dal\\ufffd\\ufffd. He saw the show multiple times. At that time, art like Dal\\ufffd\\ufffd's had fallen out of fashion. Abstract expressionism was the rage. In the school setting, Williams' own work was at odds with what was being taught. \"I was just told that drawing was for people that were not sophisticated,\" he says, 'that representational art was for people that didn't have the sophistication or the inclination to understand that two-dimensional art is far-superior.\" After moving to Los Angeles from New Mexico, Williams attended Los Angeles City College, where he landed a gig as the cartoonist for the school newspaper. Later, he attended Chouinard, which became CalArts, but didn't graduate.</p>  <p>Academics may not have appreciated Williams' style, but he was still able to thrive in California's art climate. \"California has this interesting situation where it's orthodox, proper art world seeks sophistication, like every other art community in the United States, and looks toward New York,\" says Williams, \"but, by the time that cultural arm reaches to the West Coast, the sophistications got mutated and twisted.\"</p>  <p>That delayed reaction that happened when East Coast trends traveled West was, in a way, helpful for Williams. \"You have an accidental freedom on the West Coast,\" he says. </p>  <p>Indeed, Williams taps into that freedom in his art. Take \"Swap Meet Sally,\" from his current show. The titular character reclines under an umbrella, t-shirt hiked above her navel, long legs exposed below the hem of her short-shorts. Surrounding her are a variety of odds and ends-- a guitar, a pair of cowboy booths, some hats, a scuba helmet that looks as though it came out of an H.G. Wells story. Above her, a green, naked woman is sprawled out on some psychedelic, cash-colored cloud. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Artwork by Robert Williams\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/robwilliams_1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"504\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>\"The wonderful thing about swap meets is that you can develop a taste for something that the general public hasn't decided to light on to,\" says Williams inside his home library. He mentions antiques that haven't quite made an impact on the secondary market, but might do so in a few years time-- \"It's a prospector and a treasure hunter's dream.\" It's a scene that seemingly belongs to Southern California, where swap meets have long been part of the sprawl. </p>  <p>Then there's \"Hollywood After Midnight,\" with images of Satan popping out from a nighttime view of the neighborhood. Williams' description posted next to the painting weaves a sordid tale of the devil as someone looking for a big break in an industry that's by and large situated outside of Hollywood's boundaries. </p>  <p>As a child, Williams was heavily influenced by EC Comics, the publisher of titles like \"Tales from the Crypt\" that angered adults nationwide, triggering the Senate Subcommittee Hearing into Juvenile Delinquency and the founding of the Comics Code Authority. \"It was just like catnip to me,\" he says. \"And, they were right, it did poison the youth, because I'm a testimony to it.\"</p>  <p>Williams has always stood out as defiant. \"My stuff, if you look at it, and you look at it psychologically, it's contrary to our social mores,\" he says. \"It's outlaw art, maybe tamed down a little bit.\" Zap Comix was notorious in its day; Williams notes the booksellers who were arrested for carrying the works. Long after that, Williams continued to ruffle feathers. In 1992, MOCA hosted the exhibition \"Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s\" and Williams was part of that show. He pulls out a monograph to show a painting that appeared in that exhibition. In it, Mata Hari stands above the Crown Prince of Prussia and the French Minister of War, both of whom have their respective country's flags waving from their behinds as they lick her feet. In another corner, Williams depicts the carnage of World War I, right under an Eiffel Tower let up by messages that Mata Hari was passing along to the Germans. Up at the top of the painting, Mata Hari sits naked on a white horse, a reference to an anecdote from Gertrude Stein. </p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p><img alt=\"Artwork by Robert Williams\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/robwilliams_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"539\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>\"It's a lurid painting and it upset a lot of people at the Helter Skelter show, but I'm proud of it,\" he says. </p>  <p>Williams' work is particular to the era in which he came up as an artist. \"This thing started out as an extreme underground art movement and, as more people involve themselves in it, the more it will dilute out into acceptability,\" he says. \"It started out almost on the edge of sedition; there was a lot of pornography and questionable material. I just assumed it stay that way, but that's passed. The underground is long, long dead. Those are the days of Zap Comix.\"</p>  <p>Yet, there are some things that remain. \"What has survived is a zeitgeist and an intensity of interests that young people have picked up on,\" he says. That has, and will continue, to change the art world. </p>  <p>\"The world I function in is a world of all these bastardized forms of art that are eventually going to assimilate into one or two forms of formal art,\" he says. \"That's just going to happen. The bottom always comes to the top in art. Always.\"</p>  <p>Williams adds, \"The question is, am I going to live long enough to bear the fruits of this? The genie is out of the box.\"</p>  <p></p>  <hr>  <p><strong>Dig this story? <a href=\"http://kcet.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c2be079f33ff6f73d5571f3ac&id=a379363cac\">Sign up</a> for our newsletter to get unique arts & culture stories and videos from across Southern California in your inbox.

The gallery, in an industrial corner of downtown L.A. below the 10, is hosting a dinner to celebrate the opening reception of its latest show, a mixed media exhibition by Karl Haendel and sculptures by Jacob Yanes. The dinner, cooked by Haendel and Marple, uses the same ingredients -- split peas and wheatberries -- featured on the floor of the show. </p>  <p>The dinner is emblematic of a portion of L.A.'s art scene: laid-back, democratic, and bootstrapped. It's a stark contrast from the catered dinners hosted by more established galleries in Culver City and Hollywood. Yet these dinners, along with the opening receptions and exhibitions, are integral to what USC public policy professor Elizabeth Currid-Halkett terms the \"seemingly informal social world\" of a city's cultural economy. </p>  <p>In some ways the show itself is almost beside the point -- the merchandising side of a retail business where no one pays retail. \"Mounting shows is the most visible but also the most minor part of what we do,\" says Nemeroff. In fact, Los Angeles and Orange County's galleries are punching far above their weight when it comes to their economic impact. While Otis College's Report on the Creative Economy estimates the total number of gallery jobs to be just 1,000 total, the economic output is $93 million in 2013. </p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/540gallerystacks_580.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Most of the complicated work of galleries happens behind the scenes. While the exhibits are what draw visitors to the gallery, the role of the gallery extends beyond curation. \"We sell work but also help artists strategize their career for the long term,\" explains Marple. </p>  <p>For galleries that means placing the work in the hands of the \"right\" collectors. Unlike just about any other commodity, the value of art isn't determined solely by supply and demand, or the cost of production and distribution. Rather, market value is impacted by who else is collecting the work of an artist. The implicit approval of a collector like L.A.-based philanthropist Eli Broad or Michael Ovitz can catapult the work of an emerging artist towards higher market prices. </p>  <p>While Broad and his peers focus on the higher end of the art market, there are newer tastemakers like Stefan Simchowitz shaking up L.A.'s art ecosystem. A perpetual lightning rod for controversy, Simchowitz is part of a new breed of collectors, focused on speculative (some may say predatory) investing in emerging or unknown artists.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/250gridtree_580.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"326\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Not unlike a venture capitalist, Simchowitz funds work by newer or unknown artists, buys multiple pieces, and hopes to flip them once an artist's career begins to ascend. It's high risk and high reward but the model has worked for him before. He was an early collector of current art world darlings Oscar Murillo, Petra Cortright, and Kour Pour.</p>  <p>While Simchowitz isn't a gallery in the traditional sense of the world, he treads on their turf financing, buying, selling, and promoting artists. And he's not the only recent interloper. Beverly Hills talent agency UTA even announced a new division, UTA Fine Arts, to represent visual artists just as they do Hollywood film stars.</p>  <p>According to the firm's <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hollywood-talent-agencys-new-division-to-manage-visual-artists-careers-1423616988\">announcement</a>, the division intends to help artists finance projects, get commissions, arrange corporate and institutional partnerships, and even get endorsement or merchandising deals. Perhaps most radically, whereas the artist and dealer split is typically 50/50, UTA plans to charge its standard 10 percent commission on projects. </p>  <p>Certainly the arrival of new nodes in L.A.'s complex and interconnected art ecosystem is spurred by an overheated and competitive marketplace. Over the past year, the major auction houses continue to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-10/richter-s-abstract-fetches-record-46-million-at-sotheby-s-sale\">hit new records in sales</a>. \"There is one quote-unquote art world triggered by news of auction results,\" says Bettina Korek, founder of independent arts organization For Your Art. \"But that's not the only art world in Los Angeles.\" </p>  <p><img alt=\"Scents in the IAO lab.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/IAOScents.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"364\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Saskia Wilson-Brown\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/IAO1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"363\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>In fact, it's the fluidity of L.A.'s art scene that continues to attract artists to the city. The city has historically lured artists here with promises of cheap real estate, good light, and open spaces. More critically, the stereotype of Los Angeles as a site for creative experimentation still rings true. </p>  <p>Korek says artists in L.A. \"can create and choose their own path. More activities are more directly in their control. They have more agency for themselves.\" She cites the abundance of artist-run spaces such as Michol Hebron's recently opened Situation Room as one example, as well as the Women's Center for Creative Work, Laura Owen's 356 Mission and Saskia Wilson-Brown's <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/institute-for-art-and-olfaction.html\">Institute for Art and Olfaction</a>. These are all artist-run alternative spaces focused on engaging the wider community. And to Korek, these spaces exemplify the idea that there isn't a singular, defined trajectory for artists. </p>  <p>That sense of freedom is what also kept artist <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/unfaithful-copies-artist-liz-glynn-creates-hoards-of-ancient-artifacts.html\">Liz Glynn</a> in Los Angeles after finishing her MFA at the California Institute of the Arts in 2008. Glynn, whose work has been shown at the Hammer Museum, LACMA and MOCA believes L.A. provides an environment that allows her to create ambitious projects outside the typical boundaries of institutional practices.</p>  <p>\"Practically, it's also easier than New York because of the real estate situation,\" she says. That's become a common refrain from artists who have migrated from the east coast. In the past few years, there has been an influx of highly visible artists relocating to L.A., including Jordan Wolfson, Ryan Trecartin, Sam Falls, Gabriel Kuri, and Thomas Demand. </p>]]>         <![CDATA[<p></p>  <p><img alt=\"Liz Glynn in her studio with her ceramic copy (in progress) of the Salisbury Hoard | Photo: Sharon Mizota.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/IMG_1460_web.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"433\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Liz Glynn's ceramic copy (in progress) of the Salisbury Hoard | Photo: Sharon Mizota.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/IMG_1461_web.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"433\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>It's not just artists that are moving to Los Angeles. While L.A. has long been an outpost for global gallery networks like Gagosian, only recently have smaller but highly influential enterprises made their way west. London and Berlin's Spruth Magers and New York's Maccarone are both planning to open new spaces in Los Angeles in 2015. Hauser & Wirth, with former MOCA curator Paul Schimmel are opening a massive 100,000 square foot multidisciplinary space in the Arts District. The gallery will also contain a bookstore, restaurant, and artist studios. </p>  <p>While the scale of Hauser Wirth & Schimmel is several orders of magnitude larger than a scrappy operation like Night Gallery, their intention is the same: become a hub for the art community in Los Angeles. \"We're a place for dialogue, a gathering point,\" says Marple. </p>  <hr> <em>The 2014 Otis Report will be available for download online at Otis' website on Wed., March 11, 2015.

After putting two articles up for a vote, the audience chose this article to be made into a short-format documentary. </div><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>  <p><br /> The phrases \"public housing\" or \"low-income housing\" do not generally conjure thoughts of architectural innovation. Instead, one may envision rows of faded pastel cubes surrounded by dead lawns and tall fences, or looming concrete towers gridded with small windows. Both schemes are typically weighted with a grim institutional air, appear to have been built as cheaply as possible, and often address only one problem, shelter, amid many others. </p>  <p>But it doesn't have to be that way, as several recent housing developments in Los Angeles prove. Instead, they pose the question: What if low-income housing was perceived as leading the vanguard of innovative, responsive architecture? </p>  <p>Take the recently completed <a href=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/counties/los-angeles/houses-modernism-los-angeles.html\">Star Apartments</a>, located in the heart of downtown's Skid Row. Commissioned by <a href=\"http://skidrow.org/\">Skid Row Housing Trust</a>, and designed by renowned L.A. architect Michael Maltzan, it provides permanent housing and social services to the formerly homeless. Star Apartments is also breathtaking architecture, consisting of a staggered row of four-story white blocks hovering over the existing ground level. Between these two levels is a large terrace, providing communal outdoor space away from the street. To save on cost and construction time, the 102 housing units within the blocks were prefabricated and lifted by crane on top of each other like blocks. Maltzan states that it's the first multi-unit housing to use this method since the mid-20th century, a time when prefabrication was celebrated as a modern, mechanized solution to the housing problem. </p>  <p><img alt=\"Rendering of the Star Apartments\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Star_Apartments_Michael_Maltzan.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"386\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Star Apartments elevation.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/StarApartments_Elevation_MMA.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"193\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Star Apartments night rendering.\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/StarApartments_NightRendering_MMA.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"289\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>Besides offering permanent subsidized housing, Star Apartments features an on-site wellness center, medical clinic, and community areas for socializing, making art, using computers, and exercising. As Theresa Hwang, Community Architect at the Trust notes, these additions to the residences represent a unique architectural investment in community-building activities. \"It's really pushing the typology of permanent supportive housing,\" she says.</p>  <p>Star Apartments is Maltzan's third design with the Trust for this population. His Rainbow (2006) and Carver (2009) apartments also offer spaces for socializing like courtyards and communal gardens and kitchens. It's an especially urgent design element for a population that can feel extremely cut off from public life. Skid Row Housing Trust, a non-profit diversely funded by the city and state, federal tax credits, grants, and donations, is driven by the question: \"How can the homeless become viewed as equal if their housing is not?\" As to questions about spending more than the bare minimum on their projects, there's an equation. Living in equal housing creates a sense of pride which in turn encourages permanence for the residents. As the Trust maintains, if the residents remain in stable housing, that means they're at less risk of ending up with medical emergencies or being arrested and sent to prisons; it ultimately saves taxpayer money.</p>  <p><img alt=\"Carver Apartments\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Carver_1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"387\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><br /> Besides Maltzan, the Trust has partnered with Koning Eizenberg Architects, Killefer Flamang, Perkins + Will, and other notable local firms. The results are an emerging landscape of strikingly designed buildings, responsive to the needs of their residents, and far more compelling, architecturally, than many of the indistinguishable condos rising throughout downtown.  </p>  <p>In fact, these residences are creating a new design-trail, with requests to tour the buildings pouring in daily. \"If our buildings become an 'architectural playground' that could be a positive thing,\" says Hwang. \"It helps break down borders between people.\" It may also help to integrate this kind of housing into more affluent neighborhoods that often attempt to bar it. </p>  <p>Noting that most urban transformation often results in huge centralized projects like L.A. Live or The Grove, Maltzan points out the unique geographic dispersion of the Trust's buildings, which are building up \"a series of small points on the map over time. If you were start to draw lines between them and create an imaginary web, you realize that that also can have an enormous effect on the whole perception of the city.\" He adds, \"Frankly, I think that's what the Trust is achieving. They're changing the city one increment at a time, but it's starting to become a very large and powerful influence.\"</p>  <p><img alt=\"Residents in front of the newly constructed Pueblo Del Rio Housing Project. | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/PueblodelRio_4.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"458\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>In addition to innovative architecture, the Trust's design process itself is unique. Each architecture firm has meetings with staff, property managers, and current and future Trust residents to discuss the design plan and how it should be altered. \"This way the aesthetics of the project are deeply linked to its functionality from the beginning,\" says Hwang. Hiring architects willing to experiment, listen to the residents' needs, and create uplifting designs the city can be proud of, is something the Trust (as well as similar organizations like Santa Monica's Community Corporation and West Hollywood Community Housing Corp) is committed to. </p>  <p>As an ambition, though, such aims aren't new to Southern California. Many of our celebrated architects of decades past, influenced by European modernism, were passionate about design as a means for social progression. (Even the iconic midcentury modern homes of the Case Study House Program were intended for affordable mass production.) Funding was frequently  a challenge, but the changing political landscape had an even greater impact.</p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/shape.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"37\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>During the Depression, affordable housing was a nationwide concern; in 1940s Southern California that urgency overlapped with a need to house wartime factory workers and then returning veterans. Bolstered by federal financial support (Housing Act of 1937) and a continuing New Deal ethos, housing was considered a human right and discussed with a level of positive, even moral rhetoric that seems impossibly idealistic from today's vantage. To wit, Franklin Roosevelt's proposal for a second Bill of Rights, in 1944, included \"the right of every family to a decent home.\" </p>  <p>In the service of social progression, many architects of this era fused modernist design with the pastoral ideals of the Garden City movement to create quickly fabricated, affordable, and dignifying residential developments. Historian Don Parsons calls this design-for-the-masses \"community modernism.\" There was the architecturally and socially progressive <strong>Aliso Village,</strong> designed by Ralph Flewelling and Lloyd Wright (son of Frank Lloyd Wright). Opened in 1942 in Boyle Heights, Aliso was one of the first racially integrated housing projects in the nation. Its innovative masterplan offered protected green space away from the street, simple light-filled dwellings, a school and adjacent nursery school, and sheltered play areas for children. <strong>Pueblo del Rio</strong> (1941-42) was designed by a team of star architects, including Paul R. Williams, Richard Neutra, Gordon B. Kaufmann, and Wurdeman & Becket. It featured modern, sunny apartments with access to both private and communal outdoor spaces, and an average of one-and-a-half fruit trees per household.<sup>1</sup> In Richard Neutra's unrealized plans for <strong>Amity Village</strong> in Compton, he wanted the design to mimic living in a park instead of a city. Again intending for the site to offer enriching options beyond mere shelter, Neutra's plan included mixed-use areas for businesses, a craft center, a nursery, school, and a community-meeting and recreation center.<sup>2</sup>      </p>  <p><img alt=\"Exterior view of Aliso Village | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Aliso_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"456\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /><br />   <br /> <img alt=\"Exterior view of the entrance to Aliso Village | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/Aliso_3.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"416\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>With funding from the 1937 housing act, ten public housing projects were constructed in Los Angeles: Aliso Village, Avalon Gardens, Estrada Courts, Hacienda Village, Pico Gardens, Pueblo del Rio, Ramona Gardens, Rancho San Pedro, Rose Hill Courts, and William Mead Homes. In 1949, more funding was granted for the construction of Mar Vista Gardens, Nickerson Gardens, and San Fernando Gardens.<sup>3</sup>  </p>  <p>However, this golden era was abruptly eclipsed. During the Cold War, Southern California emerged as a stronghold of McCarthyism. Private sector real estate boards, property owner leagues, and the politicians seeking their votes launched an outright war against public housing, which was portrayed as \"part of a conspiratorial effort by well-placed communists [...] to destroy traditional American values through a carefully calculated policy of racial and class struggle.\"<sup>4</sup> The local housing authority was demonized and compared to the Gestapo. This conflict was so incendiary that public housing became the primary issue during Los Angeles's 1953 mayoral race, and the incumbent candidate who supported it was branded a communist and lost.<sup>5</sup> The winner, Norris Poulson, instantly canceled the city's public housing contract with the federal government.</p>  <p><img alt=\"View of nearly completed Pueblo del Rio Housing Project | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/PueblodelRio_1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"466\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"View of the newly constructed Pueblo Del Rio Housing Project | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/PueblodelRio_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"457\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>One of the most infamous examples of this witch-hunt is the story of Chavez Ravine. Located where Dodger Stadium and its parking lots now sit, the low-income neighborhood had been declared a slum and the Housing Authority commissioned Robert Alexander and Richard Neutra to design housing for the residents. Their stately design for what he named <strong>Elysian Park Heights</strong> included a mix of low- and high-rise housing in a parklike setting laced with gardens and trees, and terraced garden apartments landscaped for privacy. However, the project was derailed by the political firestorm. When Housing Authority employees protested, they were subsequently dismissed, blacklisted, and sent to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<sup>6</sup>  </p>  <p><img alt=\"Exterior of an proposed Park Elysian Heights housing project | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/elysianheights_2.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"272\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p><img alt=\"Exterior view of a proposed housing project for Elysian Heights | Courtesy of the Los Angeles Public Library\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/elysianheights_1.jpg\" width=\"580\" height=\"463\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>The last housing project constructed by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles was in 1955. With major federal and state funding gone, the city turned to voucher programs and leasing. Lacking a commitment to existing building maintenance and accompanying social services, however, many communities declined. There have been examples of innovative low-income housing in specific areas, like Santa Monica, in the ensuing decades, but nothing has come close to the scope of the midcentury expansion. </p>  <p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/arts/artbound/images/shape.png\" width=\"40\" height=\"37\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /></p>  <p>While the context of the midcentury differs radically from today, and low-income housing is not the same as permanent supportive housing for the homeless --these eras are linked by the classic Modernist notion that good and uplifting design is for everyone. </p>]]>         <![CDATA[<div style=\"width: 250px;\" class=\"infobox\"> <p>More on L.A.

I see the projects we're doing with the Skid Row Housing Trust as an extension of both that kind of experimental mindset and culture in Los Angeles, but also very much an extension of the Modernist project.\"  <p><br /> This year marks the 25th anniversary of the Trust. Los Angeles still has work to do in both addressing its growing homeless population (the second largest in the nation), and the need for affordable housing amidst rising density and gentrification. But perhaps what's underway is paving a path toward an updated paradigm of \"community modernism\" for a new century.</p>  <p>While the Trust's focus is on Los Angeles, these trailblazing projects could ideally alter thinking about what the template and integration of affordable and supportive housing could look like on a global level. It's common for cities to pursue fame for the headline-grabbing architecture of massive sports stadiums, skyscrapers, or radical cultural centers. What would it mean for Los Angeles to become known for a successful and sustainable network of beautiful housing projects for its most vulnerable citizens? At the very least, it would result in a unique form of civic pride--one that would stem from living in a more equitable, and thus more vibrant city.</p>  <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>  <p><sup>1</sup>See the Paul Williams <a href=\"http://www.paulrwilliamsproject.org/gallery/1940s-multifamily-housing/\">website</a>.</p>  <p><sup>2</sup>Amity Compton was never realized. Due to the war, it became Channel Heights near the Los Angeles Harbor to house defense workers. Some of Neutra's design elements remained, but much had to be altered.
