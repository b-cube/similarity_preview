These studies have used sounds with neutral&#13; or negative valence: sinusoidal I -kHz tones or short pink noise&#13; bursts. Since music therapy research shows beneficial effects of&#13; pleasant, natural sounds and music, the sounds in the experiments&#13; may have been suboptimal. Thus, we aimed at choosing optimal&#13; sounds such that they could be used in increasing the depth or duration&#13; of SWS taking into account both the need of fast rise times,&#13; short duration, and pleasantness. Here we report results of a listening&#13; test mimicking a sleeping situation in which the subjects&#13; compared how pleasant, relaxing, and image-evoking they found&#13; 3 natural, short instrument sounds with fast rise times compared&#13; to a short pink noise burst used in the previous experiments. The&#13; natural sounds were selected from our previous listening test as&#13; the most pleasant ones. The results will be used as the basis for&#13; choosing the optimal sounds for the sleep studies.

In a paper presented at ICAD&#13; 2013 [1], we introduced a series of techniques using CEP for&#13; simultaneous sonification of both quantitative \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhard\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd data and&#13; human-derived \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsoft\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd data in the context of assistive&#13; technology. The connection of CEP and sonification was&#13; explored further in the context of a severe weather tracker that&#13; relies on fusion of quantitative (sensor-based) weather data&#13; along with human observations about storms and related&#13; conditions [2]. An area of shortcoming in both of these earlier&#13; works was the difficulty in creating sounds that represented&#13; human sentiment about observed conditions (e.g. unanticipated&#13; obstacles for a blind person crossing a busy street, or&#13; impending dangerous weather conditions) in a format that&#13; enabled intuitive listening for improved situational awareness.&#13; This extended abstract provides an update on that continuing&#13; research by representing human sentiment data, via the use of&#13; vocal synthesis that is driven by Complex Event Processing.

Built in the Max/MSP Audio Programming Environment, iEAR&#13; utilizes well-established panning methods to accommodate a&#13; wide range of speaker configurations. Audio scene orientation&#13; is tied to the visual scene using an OSC connection with the visualization software, allowing users to render and spatialize&#13; multichannel environmental audio recordings in tandem with&#13; the changing perspective in the visual scene.

Camille; Faisst, Cody; Slota, Nathan; Verona, Daniel; Williams, Chase; Ritchey, Paul Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a means for measuring muscle activity. sEMG data are typically displayed graphically on a computer screen and while this can be a useful way to display the data, it is not always ideal. This extended abstract details the development of a sonification tool that allows users to sonify sEMG data in real-time. The tool will allow the user to independently control the sound of each channel, similar to a software synthesizer. Independent real-time control of each channel will allow the user to create sonification models, which are mappings of certain sounds to specific muscle groups. A prototype of the tool is currently being developed using SuperCollider in parallel with a Delsys Trigno Wireless sEMG system. This tool will allow users to easily explore various kinds of sEMG sonification models and test them for intuitiveness and effectiveness.
