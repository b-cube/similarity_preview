This new report discusses the use of these commercially-viable alternative refrigerants and what it can mean for achieving India's national energy and climate goals, alleviating the burdened energy grid, and providing a growing export market for domestic manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Delhi Chapter of the Indian Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (&lt;a href=\"http://ishrae.in/\"&gt;ISHRAE&lt;/a&gt;) is convening this two-day international stakeholder conference to discuss the latest developments in RAC technology in India and worldwide. The innovative refrigerants are now available to replace hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), one of the most potent of six greenhouse gases, while also operating more efficiently than traditional air conditioners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Leading manufacturers such as &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/akar/hydrocarbon_room_air_conditioners.html\"&gt;Godrej&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Boyce and &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/akar/hfc-32_for_india_ac.html\"&gt;Daikin&lt;/a&gt; are already manufacturing and marketing RAC units using climate-friendly refrigerants, R-290 and R-32, respectively-- demonstrating India's opportunity to not only mitigate climate change, but also to reap the energy benefits of commercially viable options available now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the new issue brief clarifies, India's air conditioning market is in need of, and primed to adopt alternative refrigerants that reduce stress on the energy grid, operate more efficiently, open up new export markets and combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;India's AC market is growing, placing a burden on the energy grid.&lt;/b&gt; With India's already high ambient temperatures, rising middle class and fast-growing economic needs, air conditioning use is increasing rapidly. In fact, it is projected to grow five-fold from 2005 to 2030, resulting in increased demand on India's power grid. With 1.2 billion people currently without electricity and daily power outages a regular occurrence due to the current stress on the energy grid, reducing energy demands is vital to supplying reliable power across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Using alternative AC refrigerants is the low hanging fruit to combat climate change&lt;/b&gt;. Weather patterns are altered due to climate change, making an already hot India even hotter. This results in a dangerous cycle that requires more air conditioners to keep people comfortable in the face of the increasing heat. The default refrigerant, technology used by most Indian manufacturers today, is HFC-410A that has a GWP of 2,088. HFCs have the potential to raise the global temperature by 0.5\\ufffd\\ufffdC all by themselves by 2100. The alternatives are the R-290 or propane, which has a GWP of less than 5 and the R-32, which has a GWP of 675. These reductions are significant. Studies estimate that the use of R-32 could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 31% by 2050.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alternative energy efficient technology is available.&lt;/b&gt; As the air conditioning market expands, utilizing and providing a supportive policy framework to encourage the use of energy efficient refrigerants can help address the growing energy crisis in India. R-290 is already on the market and could save 11.9 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of energy per month over the HFC-410A refrigerant that is currently being used. It has a 5 star energy efficiency rating from India's Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) and a recent Godrej &amp;amp; Boyce model was labeled the \"&lt;a href=\"http://tennews.in/godrej-appliances-unveils-indias-first-diet-ac-range-with-the-highest-energy-efficiency-rating-in-its-category/\"&gt;Diet AC&lt;/a&gt;\" because it surpassed India's energy efficiency standards. R-32 is also a viable option that is being sold in 30 different countries. Daikin's model received the prestigious grand prize for excellence in energy efficiency and conservation in Japan. The U.S. recently approved both &lt;a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/\"&gt;R-290&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://in.finance.yahoo.com/news/hfc-32-refrigerant-receives-epa-214600629.html\"&gt;R-32&lt;/a&gt; as viable alternatives under its Significant New Alternatives Program (SNAP). Switching to lower-GWP options could result in a 15% energy savings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;There is a supportive international framework to enable the transition to alternative refrigerants in India.&lt;/b&gt; India can seek support from the &lt;a href=\"http://ozone.unep.org/new_site/en/montreal_protocol.php\"&gt;Montreal Protocol&lt;/a&gt; framework that is already in place and has served as a successful tool in addressing a transition away from ozone-depleting substances such as &lt;a href=\"http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2012/07/12/000333037_20120712013344/Rendered/PDF/ICR22410P069370C0disclosed070100120.pdf\"&gt;chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)&lt;/a&gt;. India is in the process of phasing out use of ozone depleting refrigerants as part of its national commitment under the Montreal Protocol. However, in the move away from CFCs that deplete the ozone, the industry is substituting CFCs with HFCs that have a significant global warming impact, over a thousand times stronger than carbon dioxide. It is almost certain that high-GWP HFCs would also need to be phased out eventually. In order to be efficient, India could utilize the Montreal Protocol to leapfrog to low-GWP alternatives right away, rather than using technology that will become globally obsolete.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Switching to alternative refrigerants supports national goals.&lt;/b&gt; Using energy efficient refrigerants in air conditioners supports the central government's goals to improve access to energy while achieving energy security. During U.S. President Obama's recent visit, Prime Minister Modi announced his &lt;a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/30/us-india-joint-statement\"&gt;commitment&lt;/a&gt; to making concrete progress on phasing down HFCs at the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in 2015. The opportunities are vast. What is clear is that the business-as-usual scenario will place such a burden on the energy grid that the national goals will be impossible to reach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Alternative refrigerants support Indian manufacturers keeping pace with international market trends. &lt;/b&gt;In line with Prime Minister Modi's \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.makeinindia.com/live-projects-industrial-corridor/Investment_Opportunities_in_India.pdf\"&gt;Make In India&lt;/a&gt;\" campaign, Indian manufacturers could potentially benefit significantly from switching to alternative low-GWP refrigerants that are being adopted in key markets worldwide. Global markets such as Europe, Japan, the U.S., and China are already phasing-down use of high-GWP HFCs. The alternatives, R-290 and R-32, are currently available and have superior energy efficiency ratings. India could penetrate many markets if it pursued these energy efficient alternatives. Continuing down the path of HFC-410A forecloses these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The opportunity for industry, the government, and Indian air conditioner consumers is significant. Leapfrogging over antiquated, soon-to-be obsolete, and inefficient refrigerants will benefit the power sector while saving consumers money. It will also advance the Indian economy, ensure Indian industries can compete in the international market, and help mitigate climate change, while supporting India's national goals of being energy secure in the face of rapidly rising energy demands from the world's third largest economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Co-authored by Shannon Dilley, NRDC Vermont Law School Fellow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ajaiswal/Reducing%20Stress%20on%20India%27s%20Energy%20Grid_Final%20March%2020.pdf\"&gt;http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ajaiswal/Reducing%20Stress%20on%20India%27s%20Energy%20Grid_Final%20March%2020.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=dBO2oyKmGo0:MmWTmkZIHIE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=dBO2oyKmGo0:MmWTmkZIHIE:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=dBO2oyKmGo0:MmWTmkZIHIE:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/dBO2oyKmGo0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ajaiswal/draft.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Five Key Questions Lawmakers Should Ask About ComEd's New Energy Legislation</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/1JB6O77cPT8/five_key_questions_lawmakers_s.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/rstanfield//204.18160</id>         <published>2015-03-19T20:12:48Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-19T20:45:17Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Rebecca Stanfield, Deputy Director for Policy, Midwest Program, Chicago:                  Today Commonwealth Edison (ComEd) has proposed new legislation in the Illinois General Assembly it says will boost clean energy, and we welcome their acknowledgement that Illinois needs to embrace clean energy technologies.

The bill is one of several energy bills that will be considered this year, including the Illinois Clean Jobs Act (HB 2607/SB 1485) which is supported by NRDC and many other clean energy companies and advocates. We hope ComEd's bill represents a starting point for negotiation, and not a bottom line for the company. Here are five questions lawmakers must ask ComEd about its bill as they prepare to consider a wide range of energy bills this session:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;How many megawatt hours of renewable energy and energy efficiency savings will result from ComEd's proposal over the next fifteen years, compared to the Illinois Clean Jobs Act (&lt;span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Cambria', 'serif'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-bidi; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"&gt;HB2607 and SB1485)&lt;/span&gt;? Will the proposal result in more or less investment in energy efficiency compared to the status quo?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ComEd proposes that it should earn a return on the amount it spends on energy efficiency, a departure from current practice. Why should we adopt a financial incentive for utilities that promotes SPENDING rather than rewarding the energy SAVINGS that should result from the energy efficiency programs. Shouldn't utility financial rewards be based on performance, in terms of amount of energy saved, rather than on how much they spend?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ComEd proposes to include voltage optimization - which will reduce the amount of energy wasted in the process of distributing electricity-- as a substitute for traditional customer-sited energy efficiency measures to meet its efficiency goals. Why is ComEd not doing voltage optimization now under its current authority? Shouldn't voltage optimization be part of ComEd's ongoing basic obligation to maintain the distribution system, not as a substitute for energy efficiency programs that reduce end-use energy waste?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ComEd proposes a move to variable demand based rates for distribution services, a critical change from current ratemaking policies. How will this impact electricity bills for customers who invest in efficiency or distributed generation? How will this proposal encourage customers to manage their consumption during times of system peak, when the system is most strained?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;ComEd proposes to invest $250 million over five years to build microgrids. How much pollution will be emitted by the generation of the electricity used to power these microgrids? Will ComEd agree that any new microgrids must be powered by clean renewable energy?&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope to get the answers to these and other questions as part of a robust dialogue that includes both ComEd and the many members of the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition, which consists of 49 companies and 31 organizations who are working to build the clean energy economy in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=1JB6O77cPT8:MqQ_3Xszb54:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=1JB6O77cPT8:MqQ_3Xszb54:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=1JB6O77cPT8:MqQ_3Xszb54:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/1JB6O77cPT8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/rstanfield/five_key_questions_lawmakers_s.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">A New Tool to Assess the Benefits and Costs of Distributed Energy Resources from the Electric Power Research Institute</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/4LkWzsgu4-A/a_new_tool_to_assess_the_benef.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/pbull//158.18159</id>         <published>2015-03-19T18:16:54Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-19T18:21:42Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Pierre Bull, Policy Analyst, Air & Energy, New York City:                  If you've been following the solar news recently, you know there's a huge controversy brewing about the benefits and costs that distributed solar power systems bring to the electric grid.

They remind us, in just one example of the clean technology's many benefits, that solar puts the most power onto the grid when demand is highest, meaning all customers pay less for their electricity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NRDC has &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/attacks_on_solar_should_be_rej.html\"&gt;long maintained&lt;/a&gt; that utilities and regulatory agencies should fully evaluate the benefits and costs of distributed clean-energy resources (DERs) like solar before tinkering with rate changes and designs or with policies such as net metering that facilitate the use of DERs. Electric grids, after all, are complex entities that are both unique to their locations and also share qualities with other grids. There's not necessarily a one-size-fits-all answer to these issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Part of the problem in advancing this idea is that, to date, there's been &lt;a href=\"http://www.rmi.org/elab_emPower\"&gt;little data&lt;/a&gt; to rely on. The state of California, through an ongoing &lt;a href=\"http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUC/energy/DistGen/NEMWorkShop04232014.htm\"&gt;regulatory proceeding&lt;/a&gt; on net metering, is expected to unload a trove of data in a few weeks. And a few entities, notably Austin Energy, the municipal utility in Austin, Texas, and state commissions in Minnesota and Nevada have set about evaluating solar's benefits and costs in a systematic fashion. But, otherwise, the information we need is mostly missing and the data that is available isn't collected in a uniform fashion that allows for apples-to-apples comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Volts, Bolts and Beyond&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like electric grids themselves, EPRI's &lt;i&gt;Framework&lt;/i&gt; is highly technical. (Consider the 184-page document a kind of pleasure reading for grid operators, electrical engineers and policy wonks.) But, as the authors note in their introduction, \"&lt;i&gt;An Integrated Grid&lt;/i&gt; should make it possible for stakeholders to identify optimal architectures and the most promising configurations, recognizing that solutions vary with local circumstances, goals, and interconnections.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The details involve things like DERs' impacts on voltage regulation, protection coordination, energy losses, and reliability, along with similar impacts on things like feeder topology, short-circuit strength and X/R ratios. So, it's not for the uninitiated. But the &lt;i&gt;Framework&lt;/i&gt;'s strengths lie in these details and in its commitment to using a common evaluation methodology so that \"utilities and other stakeholders can compare and contrast studies and articulate their findings in ways that make the results applicable and useful to others.\" Doing so, its authors say, \"accelerates the development of a comprehensive understanding of the key drivers of the impacts of DER adoption at low and high levels, on distribution systems with different loads and designs, and in all electricity markets.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a limitation with the new EPRI framework, however, which the report authors acknowledge. The report does not account for important non-energy benefits such as public health improvements, job creation and the mitigation of global warming that derive from pollution-free DER like energy efficiency and renewable energy from wind and solar (not all DERs are pollution-free). While the accounting of these non-energy benefits may lie outside of the immediate dollars and cents fluctuations to customer bills, utility balance sheets and owners of DER systems they nonetheless impact our broader economy, environment, health and well-being. Measuring these non-energy benefits and costs may be a little less precise including longer time frames and using reasonable value approximations, but they certainly shouldn't be treated as zero. In order to form a more complete and accurate picture of the impacts of changing energy policy at any scale from the distributed energy resource level on up, we need to be mindful of both the energy and non-energy impacts that will result.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Building Constructive Partnerships &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not content to simply put their methodology into the public domain, EPRI is also creating an &lt;a href=\"http://integratedgrid.epri.com/\"&gt;online community&lt;/a&gt; to enable ongoing information sharing, collaborative technology assessments and pilot programs that can document the benefits and costs of DERs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Good data is key to our ability to understanding DERs' benefits and costs. EPRI should be commended for making it possible for utilities, regulators, environmentalists, consumer advocates and policymakers to work from a common framework and speak a common language, with &lt;i&gt;The Integrated Grid&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=4LkWzsgu4-A:6vLpx9cp8Vc:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=4LkWzsgu4-A:6vLpx9cp8Vc:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=4LkWzsgu4-A:6vLpx9cp8Vc:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/4LkWzsgu4-A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/pbull/a_new_tool_to_assess_the_benef.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Another Effort to Gut Protections for Fisheries and Fishing Economies is Introduced in the House</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/JaRlnX_hWdY/another_effort_to_gut_protecti.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/aadams//396.18158</id>         <published>2015-03-19T17:07:16Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-19T18:46:40Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Alexandra Adams, Oceans Advocate, Washington, D.C.:                  About a year ago now retired Congressman Doc Hastings introduced a bill to reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA).

That legislation would have effectively reversed much of the success we've had in rebuilding depleted ocean fisheries around the country. It turned back the clock to the era of boom and bust fisheries management that put both fish and livelihoods in jeopardy in the first place. Fortunately, the Hastings bill never made it to the House floor. But last week Congressman Don Young of Alaska took up the anti-fishing banner and introduced as H.R. 1335 what is essentially the same bill, once again threatening to put economically critical fisheries in peril. As the Hastings bill did, H.R. 1335 also proposes to roll back several other environmental laws as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act governs how we conserve and use our nation's fisheries. This bill was amended in 1996 and 2006 with strong bipartisan support to include provisions to end overfishing and rebuild depleted fish populations. The late Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska was a leader of these reforms, working to ensure a legacy of healthy U.S. fisheries and fishing economies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senator Stevens' legacy has proved quite successful. In the early 1990s, many important fish stocks had suffered large declines or collapses. Today, while challenges remain (such as the still-depleted New England cod populations), many once overfished stocks have been brought back. NRDC's \"&lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/oceans/files/rebuilding-fisheries-report.pdf\"&gt;Bringing Back the Fish&lt;/a&gt;\" report documented how nearly two-thirds of fish stocks put in rebuilding plans since 1996 have either rebuilt to healthy population levels, or have made significant rebuilding progress, resulting in increased gross commercial revenues of $585 million--92% higher (54% when adjusted for inflation) than before the rebuilding plans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the MSA has produced real benefits to coastal communities, fishermen, and ecosystems, Congressman Young's efforts to dismantle the law is confusing. Young's bill adds loopholes to the law, waters down legal standards, encourages costly delays, and reduces transparency and accountability. Particularly worrisome, the legislation guts the rebuilding requirements that forced fishery managers to make tough decisions that allowed our stocks to rebound, including by removing requirements for rebuilding timelines. This is being done to provide \"flexibility,\" Congressman Young says, as Hastings did before him. But the rebuilding provisions in the current law already have a huge amount of flexibility: although there is a general requirement for a 10-year rebuilding time period (scientists have demonstrated that most stocks can be rebuilt in this time period), the Magnuson-Stevens Act also provides exceptions to timelines and additional time for rebuilding plan development. In fact, with flexibility under the current law, the average time period in rebuilding plans to date has been 19.6 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;H.R. 1335 would remove the Magnuson-Stevens Act's requirement for annual catch limits for potentially hundreds of species. This would apply even to species that may be overfished or subject to overfishing. The bill would also put a significant amount of publicly-funded fisheries information off limits to fishery managers, scientists, industry and the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to dismantling fishery protections around the nations, H.R.1335 attacks critical bedrock environmental laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA), as well as the National Marine Sanctuaries Act and the Antiquities Act (by which national monuments are created). The bill provides for fishery management plans to be exempted from the requirements of NEPA, an important federal planning tool that requires public engagement in management decisions, adequate analysis of environmental impacts on the marine environment, and the consideration of reasonable alternatives and ways of minimizing adverse impacts. H.R. 1335 undermines the ESA by putting the industry-dominated fishery management councils in charge of recovering endangered marine mammals, sea turtles, and other vulnerable marine animals. The councils would also be put in charge of fisheries-related activities in national marine sanctuaries and national monuments. These councils have neither the capacity nor knowledge to enforce these critical protections. They would essentially be ignored, while species become more imperiled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fishermen have invested years of sacrifice and work under the MSA to rebuild our nation's fisheries and ensure that they remain sustainable. And that work has made the U.S a model for fisheries management around the world. This bill takes us back to a time when fishing boats came back empty and ecosystems were ravaged. Don't our fishermen and all Americans that enjoy the bounty of the oceans deserve better?&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=JaRlnX_hWdY:iDLo7Fn04TM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=JaRlnX_hWdY:iDLo7Fn04TM:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=JaRlnX_hWdY:iDLo7Fn04TM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/JaRlnX_hWdY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/aadams/another_effort_to_gut_protecti.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">New Workforce Guidelines Will Promote Energy Efficiency in Buildings</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/MRTaH2ec6Rc/new_energy_wo.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/lzullo//460.18156</id>         <published>2015-03-19T12:24:00Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-19T12:30:20Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Lauren Zullo, LEED AP O+M, Director of National Initiatives, City Energy Project, Chicago:                  American buildings use 40 percent of our nation's energy and contribute about 40 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.

The prospect of cutting those numbers significantly through better training and certification of building energy professionals is what makes last week's announcement about the creation of &lt;a href=\"https://www4.eere.energy.gov/workforce/projects/workforceguidelines\"&gt;Better Buildings Workforce Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; such an important one. This industry advancement comes to us thanks to the joint efforts of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), non-profit National Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS), and a group of energy and building industry professionals who comprised the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nibs.org/?page=cwcc\"&gt;Commercial Workforce Credentialing Council&lt;/a&gt;. The workforce guidelines were designed to simultaneously strengthen and streamline commercial building workforce training and certification programs for workers in the fields of energy auditing, building commissioning, building operations, and energy management. The guidelines are part of the federal government's broader &lt;a href=\"http://energy.gov/eere/better-buildings\"&gt;Better Buildings Initiative&lt;/a&gt; to improve the way buildings use energy, while creating jobs and strengthening the economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By creating nationally recognized standards for competency-based certification programs, these guidelines can ensure that workers have the skills they need to do their jobs effectively, while helping cut the pollution and energy costs that come from the country's commercial building sector. The guidelines will serve an important role in \"training the next generation of skilled clean-energy workers,\" says NIBS President Henry L. Green. They, after all, will \"be responsible for leading the charge in optimizing commercial building performance.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As building owners, operators, and policymakers begin focusing more attention on the energy efficiency of buildings --what's often called \"building performance\"-- and want to tap into the value that can come with improved building operations, they've learned that some workforce credentials haven't always ensured building energy workers and professionals have the levels of knowledge and technical skill that enable them to do their jobs effectively. In response, the DOE and NIBS worked with industry experts to develop these voluntary guidelines. They offer credentialing bodies a framework that will help their certification programs meet the needs and standards identified by the experts in the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Commercial Workforce Credentialing Council, which advised on the development of the guidelines and will oversee them to ensure they stay up-to-date, includes building owners and operators, industry trade associations, government agencies, credentialing bodies, service providers, and energy efficiency advocates. I participated on the Council as a representative of the &lt;a href=\"http://www.cityenergyproject.org/\"&gt;City Energy Project&lt;/a&gt; to provide perspective on how municipal governments might use the guidelines to help strengthen the local workforce and cut energy use in the cities' building sector.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having nationally-recognized certification options offers building professionals and the companies and agencies that hire them much-needed guarantees that certification programs are high quality and meet the technical standards the industry expects. This type of quality assurance is especially important in jurisdictions that require energy audits or retro-commissioning of buildings, such as San Francisco, Boston, and New York. (Energy audits are evaluations of buildings that provide owners with actionable recommendations for improvements and upgrades, and retro-commissioning is a process that ensures building systems like lighting and ventilation operate as efficiently and effectively as they were designed to.) Standardizing the market demand for certifications also provides building energy and operations professionals with assurance that the credentials they earn meet industry expectations, are relevant, and are recognized across the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By investing in our buildings and in the workforce that carries out energy improvements, we can deliver huge carbon savings along with equally impressive economic benefits. The nationally-recognized, high quality standards set forth in the Better Buildings Workforce Guidelines will help us do just that.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=MRTaH2ec6Rc:4Z24KIj1U_o:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=MRTaH2ec6Rc:4Z24KIj1U_o:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=MRTaH2ec6Rc:4Z24KIj1U_o:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/MRTaH2ec6Rc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lzullo/new_energy_wo.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">35 Percent Wind?

More wind power means cheaper energy; hundreds of thousands of new jobs; public health improvements that can save more than 21,000 lives; and, climate benefits worth more than $400 billion in prevented damage and disaster. And get this: We can do it all at essentially no cost to consumers, the report says. (Electricity prices might increase by up to 1 percent by 2030, but decrease by 2 percent by 2050, the DOE finds.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Members of Congress: This report should be required reading.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without necessarily intending to, the report also shows that the now-expired Production Tax Credit for Wind Power and the also-expired Investment Tax Credit for the nascent offshore wind power industry are smart, cost-effective investments for all Americans. And that wind power can help states economically meet their commitments (and then some) under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to cut carbon pollution from existing power plants. Really, the bigger we go with wind power, the better off we are as a nation, &lt;i&gt;Wind Vision&lt;/i&gt; shows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DOE has a history of significantly underestimating how much renewable energy we can successfully deploy, and that history repeats itself here. In fact, we can go much bigger than 35 percent with wind. And we should, for a host of reasons, not the least of which is it can help us prevent significant climate disasters. Still, even at this relatively low, 35-percent level, the benefits of wind power, described below, are pretty staggering:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Jobs, jobs, jobs:&lt;/b&gt; 600,000 of them, in fact. Especially good news from &lt;i&gt;Wind Vision&lt;/i&gt;: Many of these jobs can buttress the nation's currently floundering manufacturing sector, creating good jobs for people who often have only high school degrees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Energy savings galore:&lt;/b&gt; The more wind power and, thus, less natural gas we use to generate electricity, the lower the price of natural gas overall. The result: a cumulative, $280 billion in energy savings due to decreased natural gas demand. Those saving add 2.3 cents in value to each kilowatt hour of wind power we generate. (Funny, that's the cost of the PTC.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Easier breathing:&lt;/b&gt; When wind power displaces dirty power from the grid, it significantly cuts the pollution that pours out of power-plant smokestacks. The 35 percent target will prevent not only 21,700 premature deaths. It will avert more than 10,000 asthma-induced emergency room visits and means asthmatic kids will attend almost 2.5 million more days of school. Overall, the public health benefits are valued at 0.9 cents per kilowatt hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Rural development:&lt;/b&gt; Wind power helps keep rural communities intact by supporting land owners, and paying for vital public services like schools, police and fire protection. Getting 35 percent of the nation's electricity from the wind can mean $1 billion in annual land lease payments to land owners and more than $3 billion in annual property tax payments in rural communities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;Water, water, everywhere:&lt;/b&gt; Generating electricity in conventional and nuclear power plants eats up huge amounts of the country's increasingly scarce water resources. (In fact, the power sector uses 6 percent of total U.S. water and is responsible for a full 41 percent of fresh water withdrawals.) Wind power doesn't need water, meaning we can cut the power sector's use of water by 23 percent and reduce fresh water withdrawals by 15 percent overall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd &lt;b&gt;A happier climate:&lt;/b&gt; With wind power at 35 percent, we can cut greenhouse gas emissions by 12.3 gigatonnes by 2050. Those benefits are worth $400 billion in savings from fewer extreme weather events and disasters. And they boost the value of wind power by 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The DOE &lt;i&gt;Wind Vision&lt;/i&gt; report demonstrates all the benefits of deploying lots of pollution-free wind power. Federal support, like the PTC, more than pays for itself several times over. That's good news; Congress should take note.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=DyjHtjnybeQ:VD9e1EqjMic:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=DyjHtjnybeQ:VD9e1EqjMic:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=DyjHtjnybeQ:VD9e1EqjMic:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/DyjHtjnybeQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ngreene/35_percent_wind_no_problem_lot.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Arctic on Notice:  A Barge Adrift at Sea and Spill Modeling by the World Wildlife Fund Show the Extreme Risks of an Arctic Ocean Oil Spill</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/_-vdiUjrIOY/arctic_on_notice_a_barge_adrif.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/jaxelrod//473.18154</id>         <published>2015-03-18T19:20:38Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-18T18:20:18Z</updated>                  <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Joshua Axelrod, Policy Analyst &ndash; Canada Project, Washington, D.C.:                  This week, news of the fate of an unmanned barge set adrift in Canada's Beaufort Sea in October finally resurfaced.

Where had it gotten to after breaking from its tow north of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories? It turns out that after being stuck in the ice over winter, the barge is now off the Russian coast, having &lt;a href=\"http://www.adn.com/article/20150316/supply-barge-adrift-arctic-months\"&gt;drifted nearly 1,400 miles in just five months&lt;/a&gt;. That distance is remarkable. As Canada's National Energy Board (NEB) &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/cclusen/the_final_frontier_canadas_nat.html\"&gt;considers undisclosed and untested offshore oil and gas well safety measures&lt;/a&gt; proposed for operations in the Canada's Beaufort Sea, the potential fate and impact of an under ice oil spill in the Beaufort Sea remains a serious open question with a growing body of evidence pointing to a truly troubling answer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last fall, World Wildlife Fund Canada (WWF) provided a first glimpse of just how problematic a late-season oil spill in the Beaufort Sea could be. In &lt;a href=\"http://arcticspills.wwf.ca/#home/\"&gt;a major report modeling the impacts of an oil spill&lt;/a&gt; in Arctic waters, WWF and its partner &lt;a href=\"http://www.asascience.com/\"&gt;RPS Applied Science Associates&lt;/a&gt;, considered the likely behavior and impact of four different types of spills in the Beaufort Sea: tanker, pipeline, shallow water, and deep water. Under each scenario analyzed, oil is expected to spread across significant swaths of the Arctic Ocean. In the worst cases, &lt;a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/r-arctic-oil-well-blowout-could-spread-more-than-1000-km-wwf-study-2014-25\"&gt;spilled oil could travel more than 1,000 kilometers&lt;/a&gt; from its source with the potential for impacts to shorelines and waters in Canada, the U.S. and Russia. This week's news makes clear that 1,000km was only a conservative estimate of just how far spilled oil from these proposed operations could go. It also highlights once again that deep water oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters creates unnecessary environmental risks that could decimate an entire region's ecosystem along with the traditions and livelihoods of its indigenous population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/Spill%20Model.png\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Spill Model.png\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/assets_c/2015/03/Spill%20Model-thumb-500xauto-18983.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"440\" class=\"mt-image-none\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Surface oiling predicted by RPS ASA under a late season, deep water blowout scenario.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A short history of exploration with no payoff and limited success&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until recently, the Beaufort Sea remained ice covered for most of the year, making offshore resource development nearly impossible. &lt;a href=\"http://www.beaufortrea.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NCR-5358624-v4-BREA_-_FINAL_UPDATE_-_EXPLORATION_AND_ACTIVITY_FORECAST-__MAY_2013.pdf\"&gt;In the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing through the late 1980s, numerous exploratory wells were drilled in shallow waters in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Though oil was discovered, high costs, extreme operating conditions, declining oil prices, and discovery of only small, \"widely scattered reserves,\" led to a decline in industry interest. The short era of exploration ended for good in 1990 when the newly created Environmental Impact Review Board found that the Government of Canada and Gulf Oil, with its proposed Kulluk drilling program, were unprepared for a major oil spill event in the Beaufort Sea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/Molikpaq%20Rig.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Molikpaq Rig.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/assets_c/2015/03/Molikpaq%20Rig-thumb-350x240-18985.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"240\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Molikpaq drilling vessel in Canada's Beaufort Sea, circa 1984.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\" style=\"text-align: left;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Though ice in the Beaufort Sea has continued to recede as climate change accelerates, the challenges and risks faced by the offshore oil and gas industry remain. The Beaufort Sea is now ice free for a month or two each year, but it is completely ice covered for eight. At the same time, memories of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/26/us/26spill.html?pagewanted=all\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;recent offshore drilling disasters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, falling world oil prices, and increased international attention on activities that are driving climate change make renewed exploration as risky and unnecessary as it was in the 1970s and 80s. The problems with offshore oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters have been encapsulated by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/04/140404-coast-guard-blames-shell-in-kulluk-rig-accident/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Shell's disastrous experience in the U.S. Chukchi and Beaufort Seas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; where accidents and challenging conditions have led to massive capital spending and constant delays. Indeed, as the U.S. contemplates leasing new exploration rights in the U.S. Beaufort Sea, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Oil-companies-cooling-on-Arctic-drilling-rights-5658254.php\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;more than 50% of current U.S. exploration leases are being relinquished by the oil industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, marking a mass exodus of interest in Arctic offshore exploration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, in an apparent search for the Holy Grail of frontier oil reserves, today's Canadian operators are now looking to move farther offshore into deeper, more treacherous waters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Open vs. icy waters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;RPS ASA's modeling of potential Beaufort Sea oil spills illuminates an interesting reality: the risks and impacts posed by an oil spill in the Beaufort Sea change depending on whether the spill takes place in open water vs. icy water. Though one might assume that open water conditions would lead to fewer impacts, the truth is the opposite and more complex. As highlighted in WWF's report, any spill from a deep water operation (the type currently being proposed by industry and reviewed by the NEB) will likely lead to major harmful environmental impacts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;For an open water spill early in the drilling season (i.e., the type of spill where the most tools for remediation are available and operating conditions are the most ideal), the report finds \"a high probability that shorelines along the U.S. coast of the North Slope and Point Barrow would become moderately to heavily oiled.\" In ice covered waters, or in waters where ice is beginning to form, impacts to shorelines are lessened due to the presence of landfast ice. However, longer response times and entrapment of oil in ice lead to massive dispersion of oil throughout the Arctic Ocean along with the risk of contamination from toxic dissolved aromatics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Impacts to the marine environment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;With the potential for the massive spread of oil throughout the Arctic region comes the potential for significant environmental impacts. Under the four key scenarios modeled for a deep water well failure, RPS ASA's models show shoreline oiling ranging from 300-1,800 kilometers in length, with the most oiling occurring following an early season blowout. This means that the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://arcticspills.wwf.ca/#scenario/dw-wcd/dw-wcd-d/time/734113/layers/iba/polarbear/ringedseal/beardedseal/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;critical habitat of numerous Arctic species&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, including polar bear, migratory birds, ringed seals, and bearded seals would be directly impacted. Further, because oil would be expected to disperse widely below the surface, a blowout could lead to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://arcticspills.wwf.ca/#scenario/dw-wcd/dw-wcd-s-wc/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;major impacts to iconic marine species such a bowhead and beluga whales&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, as well as the numerous species of fish upon which indigenous communities depend.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/Bowhead.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Bowhead.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jaxelrod/assets_c/2015/03/Bowhead-thumb-500xauto-18987.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"236\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bowhead whale populations are dependent on the Beaufort Sea for survival and play a central role in indigenous whale hunting traditions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Unacceptable Risks&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Media outlets were &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-07/28/arctic-drilling\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;quick to pick up on RPS ASA's and WWF's work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;. No doubt this is because the results laid bare an essential truth about resource development in Arctic offshore areas: it is accompanied by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/energy-and-resources/wwf-report-highlights-drilling-risks-to-beaufort-sea/article19781124/\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;extraordinary risk for widespread ecological destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;. And this destruction is not limited to Canadian waters. Indeed, with proposed projects planned in areas less than 200 kilometers east of the U.S.-Canada border, impacts to Alaska's North Slope and Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could occur due to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.adn.com/article/20140725/study-envisions-possible-fallout-canadian-beaufort-oil-spill\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;predominantly westward movement of oil from a spill&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;.

As customers save energy in their homes and businesses, fossil-fuel fired power plants are called upon less and emit less pollution. But some power plant owners complain that a Clean Power Plan target that relies on reductions achieved through actions outside power plants' boundaries, like saving energy in buildings and factories, would be unachievable (see &lt;a href=\"http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D=EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0602-23423\"&gt;Comments of Class of '85 Regulatory Response Group&lt;/a&gt; at 43-44). They are wrong.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Carbon pollution credits from energy efficiency will be accessible to power plant owners, regardless of a state's regulatory model. Buying it may not yet be as easy as one-click ordering on Amazon, but even now, before the Clean Power Plan is in place, energy efficiency is evolving into a \"product\" that power plant owners can purchase.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;All types of energy efficiency \"products\" share some key features:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A definition of what types of projects are eligible to generate credits, like a requirement that projects go beyond business-as-usual or standard market practices&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Requirements for estimating savings from the projects,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Back-up provisions for what happens if those planned energy savings do not occur.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;I categorize these energy efficiency products by how the price of energy efficiency - the amount a power plant owner pays to the energy saver - is set.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fixed price&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;In this approach, power plant owners would make an offer to buy a quantity of energy efficiency credits for a set price, businesses would respond with projects, and the power plant owner would then buy credits for energy savings up to their budget constraint. There's ample precedent for this: every utility-run energy efficiency portfolio I know of has a program where customers with big projects receive a set incentive per-unit of energy savings. For example, Commonwealth Edison in Illinois currently &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.comed.com/business-savings/programs-incentives/Pages/custom-projects.aspx\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; incentives of 7 cents per-kWh of energy savings for eligible projects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Competitive solicitation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this approach, power plant owners would issue a competitive solicitation for energy efficiency credits, and businesses would respond with energy saving projects they can complete at a price they determine. &lt;a href=\"https://www.sce.com/wps/portal/home/procurement/solicitation/lcr/!ut/p/b1/rVRNb6MwEP0r9IDUHogHzIfZG21RQjZKtqVVC5fIGIewSzAxpGn665dkWVWVNqHVxifP6M3zzPPToBg9o7ikL3lGm1yUtNjHsT0fB7eePjSNYHat--CFAbn1Rz6EM7sFRC0AjhwPTtZ_x-gJxShmZVM1SxTVjM-ZKBteNnNeqtDdVeAll9lOqaRgG8lXh1wtipzlzaHTWoVCMFoojFa0Te4Uydeb_A-0Vi4LJq_2D1UsT1GEKTaNlCWalVigmTojmosXWHOpTU3XxYlu6N1gJzrvEeYw2HHIzcTuADoZeqMghACciQvB9Y97331wMXFwB3CH4I_GMwiGD3cYAnwH09DzMMBfhhPqj1GcFSI5_GTklQkmGYolX3DJ5WAj2_Syaar6mwoqbLfbQSZEVvABEysV_lWyFHWDnj8iUdRK5RzV4sZC4bv2POWunQLRHMc2NNNJqeaC6WgWsQ2eWjbBPOkhDOHchMaXCcd9vm61y3-u17HXunvv4tdWtv-xdwepGyFpxpVLXl_1TGV-mOpTnu8htM5N6HyZcPyJfXRW3fvXSrV6XBG8037dj94m_EmjCQFsVS9vk8V02kVFdnHxG_4JBog!/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/\"&gt;Southern California Edison&lt;/a&gt; recently applied this strategy to make up for lost capacity when the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station closed.

The utility selected energy efficiency projects from three vendors, totaling 130 MW of load reduction due to the energy efficiency measures.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Another example of a program that uses competitive solicitations is Consolidated Edison's &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.coned.com/energyefficiency/targetedDSM.asp\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Targeted DSM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; program, which the utility operates in its New York City and Westchester County service territory. It is called a \"targeted\" program because ConEd seeks load reductions in specific areas during specific hours, to defer or avoid specific transmission and distribution system investments. The utility determines the price it will accept for these load reductions by analyzing the costs it would avoid if it deferred the specific investment, and then issues a request for proposals to energy efficiency businesses. The program is described in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2010/data/papers/2059.pdf\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; 2010 ACEEE Summer Study paper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Auction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the third strategy, the utility or generator conducts an auction where businesses compete to provide energy savings for a set incentive, essentially asking the question: what energy saving projects would you do for a $10,000 incentive. This is a new approach, pioneered by AEP-Ohio. AEP has hired &lt;a href=\"http://www.overlayconsulting.com/\"&gt;Overlay Consulting&lt;/a&gt; to run the auctions. Pre-qualified customers and efficiency service providers bid on incentives on a $/kWh saved basis, and incentives are granted to the lowest priced bids. AEP has to-date run three auctions and paid $19.15 million in incentives. The most recent auction, in October 2014, yielded energy savings at an average incentive of 2.5 cents per-kWh of savings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Or hire a company in the energy efficiency program industry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A power plant owner could also hire one of the companies in the &lt;a href=\"http://www.aesp.org/\"&gt;energy efficiency program industry&lt;/a&gt;, and have this company deal with customers, service providers, retailers, etc. When required by a consent decree to undertake an environmental mitigation project, wholesale generation provider American Municipal Power &lt;a href=\"https://www.veic.org/media-room/news/2010/06/15/VEIC_To_Create_EFFICIENCY_SMART_POWER_PLANT_For_American_Municipal_Power_Members_In_Six_States.aspx\"&gt;hired&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"https://www.veic.org/\"&gt;Vermont Energy Investment Corporation&lt;/a&gt; - one of the nation's best energy efficiency program administrators - to run a portfolio of energy efficiency programs for its member utilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;The takeaway: generators have ample tools to reduce emissions by helping customers save energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=IEZ7JsUcFMs:ihlhdz9kw38:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=IEZ7JsUcFMs:ihlhdz9kw38:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=IEZ7JsUcFMs:ihlhdz9kw38:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/IEZ7JsUcFMs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/yes_power_plant_owners_can_red.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">NRDC Urges the New York Legislature to Support Our Ocean and Great Lakes</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/LRwvAB8HCsk/nrdc_urges_the_new_york_legisl.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/achase//197.18147</id>         <published>2015-03-18T14:00:00Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-18T13:59:07Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Ali Chase, Policy Analyst, New York:                  Once hunted to scarcity, endangered humpback whales have been making a comeback in New York waters.

Rarely seen in recent decades, the cetaceans have been delighting whale watchers in the New York Bight for the last several years, with a &lt;a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2014-12-humpback-whales-nyc.html\"&gt;high of 87 sightings in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Humpbacks and other whales have &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/wildlife/marine/nywhales/nywhales.asp\"&gt;also been recorded singing&lt;/a&gt; near New York harbor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;No one knows precisely why New York's waters are now hopping with migrating humpbacks, but we hope it is due in part to the state's efforts to protect and improve the ocean resources on which New York's citizens depend. A critical tool for this work has been New York State's Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). Traditionally financed through the Real Estate Transfer Tax (RETT), the EPF supports important research and restoration work aimed at protecting the environment and the communities that rely on its natural wealth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;That's why, today, NRDC staffers are also being spotted in migration - heading to Albany with our ocean coalition partners to encourage the state legislature to increase funding to restore and protect New York's ocean and Great Lakes assets. We're hoping to see the fiscal year 2015-2016 budget include an increase in the overall EPF to $200 million, paid for by the RETT, and in the ocean and Great Lakes line from the Governor's proposed $6.05 M toward $10 M.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;EPF funding will help ensure that the proposed actions included in the draft &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/docs/fish_marine_pdf/oceanactionplan.pdf\"&gt;New York Ocean Action Plan&lt;/a&gt; become reality. The draft OAP identifies more than 60 actions and associated steps the state should accomplish over the next decade to address current challenges in our waters, and proactively prepare for future ocean uses. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation is accepting comments on the draft plan &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/84428.html\"&gt;until March 30&lt;/a&gt;, but it's safe to say that without continued funding very little of the plan will advance. This includes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Projects to monitor whale and sea turtle populations offshore so that we can better understand the migration routes these species take and help protect them;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Efforts to reduce waste in fisheries by determining ways to mitigate \"bycatch\" - the unintended catch brought up and thrown back, dead and dying; and,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Development of a baseline ocean monitoring system to build on existing ocean observations, and track other numbers, such as ocean pH and other indicators of changes in ocean chemistry in areas--such as shellfish-growing regions--deemed ecologically and economically important to the state.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;In many cases, only &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/100471.html\"&gt;part of this work is funded&lt;/a&gt; - if at all. New EPF dollars will make the difference in whether or not these projects happen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;New York has made great strides to improve the health of its ocean and Great Lakes, but our marine life continues to struggle in the face of pollution, loss of productive habitat, and challenges like ocean acidification. More than 75 percent of the nation's commercial fish and an even greater percentage of its recreational fish catch spend part of their lives in estuary waters, yet &lt;a href=\"http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/66532.html\"&gt;more than 45 percent of New York's estuary waters are impaired&lt;/a&gt;. New York is also &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/oceans/acidification/state-vulnerability.asp\"&gt;one of the most vulnerable states to ocean acidification&lt;/a&gt;, due to its economic dependence on shellfish harvesting and its high levels of nitrogen pollution, which amplify ocean acidification's impacts. Our waters are busier than ever, with new uses like wind energy proposed and increased shipping likely from the Panama Canal expansion. We need the legislature to support ocean improvements so that the resources we rely on for food, jobs and recreation remain healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Body\"&gt;In 2012, ocean sector industries like fishing and tourism &lt;a href=\"http://www.coast.noaa.gov/quickreport/#/ENOW/ENOW/36000/2012\"&gt;contributed more than $22 billion&lt;/a&gt; to New York's gross domestic product and supported more than 313,000 jobs. Increased ocean and Great Lakes funding will enhance this economic value. It will also protect sensitive marine and Great Lake habitats, and wildlife like our beloved whales. That's the song NRDC will be singing in Albany this week, and we hope the legislature hears us.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=LRwvAB8HCsk:_C3-mUDQaJk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=LRwvAB8HCsk:_C3-mUDQaJk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=LRwvAB8HCsk:_C3-mUDQaJk:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/LRwvAB8HCsk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/achase/nrdc_urges_the_new_york_legisl.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Energy efficiency and renewables: the cheapest, smartest way for states to cut carbon pollution</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/sVwBMMucuGA/energy_efficiency_and_renewabl.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/sclefkowitz//90.18153</id>         <published>2015-03-18T13:21:31Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-18T13:24:41Z</updated>            <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, Director of Programs, Washington, D.C.:                  States will have a lot of flexibility in crafting plans to cut carbon pollution from power plants.

And when it comes to making those cuts, energy efficiency and renewable energy are the best path forward. This is made clear in a &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/clean-power-plan-state-options.asp\"&gt;new series of NRDC analyses&lt;/a&gt; that illustrate how expanding renewable energy and cutting energy waste are the cheapest, smartest ways for states to cut carbon pollution and meet their Clean Power Plan targets. So &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ddoniger/why_states_arent_rushing_to_ju.html\"&gt;despite the recent call from Senator McConnell&lt;/a&gt;, states should \"just say yes\" to moving ahead with plans to cut carbon pollution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Climate-related disasters in 2012 alone cost American taxpayers more than $100 billion. We see the effects of climate change throughout our country in violent storms, floods and droughts. It is past time to have strong limits on carbon pollution from fossil-fuel-burning power plants - the nation's biggest source of the pollution that drives climate change. And that is what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is doing with its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/clean-power-plan-benefits.asp\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Clean Power Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, which will establish the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from the electricity sector. Nationwide, the plan as proposed would cut power sector carbon pollution 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2020, and 30 percent by 2030, and usher in climate and health benefits &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/ddoniger/epas_plan_to_curb_carbon_pollu.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;worth an estimated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; $55 to $93 billion annually in 2030, far outweighing the annual compliance costs of $7-9 billion to put the new plans in place. NRDC has shown how EPA can achieve even greater reductions for substantially the same costs as EPA's plan, and even greater climate and health benefits in the final standards coming this summer. When EPA finalizes those standards, each state will have the flexibility and opportunity to design a plan to cut dirty carbon pollution that best fits the needs of its people and resources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Every state generates electricity from a unique mix of resources, which is why EPA designed so much flexibility into the Clean Power Plan. Each state has the opportunity to craft its own approach to cut carbon pollution. And the best methods by far when it comes to reducing pollution, protecting our health, and creating new jobs come from renewable energy and energy efficiency.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;The good news is that NRDC's new state-by-state analyses show that many states are already on a good path to meet their targets, and can go even further to reap the economic and health benefits through increased investment in clean energy. The analysis for states from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/privera/cutting_carbon_pollution_flori.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Florida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/lmartinez/while_state_officials_fight_it.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/spring_cleaning_in_the_keyston.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/cutting_carbon_pollution_can_d.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Montana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt; shows that these states are already on the path to reduce their carbon emissions. For them and many other states, putting a strong plan in place will mean building on their strengths through investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Energy efficiency is the least expensive way for states to meet their pollution reduction targets under the new standards. The demonstrated growth rates of the top 10 states show that smart policies or implementation plans can help states to remove existing market barriers and deploy this low-cost resource. With technological and other advances, wind and solar power costs &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/24/business/energy-environment/solar-and-wind-energy-start-to-win-on-price-vs-conventional-fuels.html?_r=0\" style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;are declining rapidly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;, becoming competitive with the costs of fossil fuel plants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;The NRDC analyses highlight a range of policy approaches that states can employ in their plans to cut carbon pollution. For example, states can choose to set standards that achieve a specific pollution rate (lbs CO2/MWh), or that meet a total pollution target (total tons of CO2). Either approach can work well to help a state craft a custom-made, innovative and effective set of solutions to cut carbon pollution. And the NRDC analyses also highlight the advantages of cooperative, multi-state approaches to help a state achieve even better results in areas such as consumer savings, reduced compliance costs, increased flexibility and reliability, and avoided electricity market distortions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;With the reality of climate change being felt across America and the world, now is the time to tackle carbon pollution to help protect our country and show the kind of leadership that will galvanize global action. With American ingenuity at work, we can harness the energy we need from efficiency and renewable sources such as the wind and the sun. And, as is often the case in America, states are in the lead in creating flexible and innovative plans to take us into the clean power future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=sVwBMMucuGA:iH820CdcXLM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=sVwBMMucuGA:iH820CdcXLM:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=sVwBMMucuGA:iH820CdcXLM:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/sVwBMMucuGA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/sclefkowitz/energy_efficiency_and_renewabl.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Cutting Carbon Pollution Can Drive Montana's Economy While Improving Health</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/eWyMWyGCyF8/cutting_carbon_pollution_can_d.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/dsullivan//203.18150</id>         <published>2015-03-17T21:42:00Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T21:44:42Z</updated>                <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Dylan Sullivan, Staff Scientist, San Francisco:                  This blog was guest-written by NRDC Fellow Amanda Levin A new factsheet released by the NRDC today highlights the huge economic and health benefits of clean energy for Montana.

Investments in clean energy have and will continue to create new jobs, expand the economy, reduce pollution, lower electricity bills, and improve public and environmental health across the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Opportunity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One way for Montana to build on its clean energy potential is through the U.S. EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan to reduce harmful pollution from power plants, which account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions. States will have great flexibility in complying with their emissions limits and can design a plan that accounts for each state's unique economic situation and needs. Investing in energy efficiency and renewable wind and solar power should be a fundamental part of Montana's strategy, as a new NRDC fact sheet issued today shows. Ramping up energy efficiency and renewable energy investments &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/state-benefits.asp\"&gt;can create&lt;/a&gt; more than 274,000 new jobs across the U.S. while saving American households and businesses over $37.4 billion on their electric bills in 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both emissions-free renewable energy and energy efficiency programs are low-cost options for Montana to reduce pollution while building its economy. Wind and solar energy are now cost-competitive with more traditional fossil-fuel energy nationally. And Montana has some of the best wind and solar resources in the country.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tapping into Montana's Natural Resources&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider that as recently as 2005, the state had no installed wind energy production. But just last year, Montana &lt;a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_1_17_b\"&gt;generated enough wind&lt;/a&gt; energy to power 200,000 households for an entire year. That's enough electricity to keep the lights on for close to half of the state's households. Meanwhile, Montana's wind generation has more than doubled&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the last five years, alone, and is still rapidly growing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/Montana_Wind.png\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Montana_Wind.png\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/assets_c/2015/03/Montana_Wind-thumb-500xauto-18977.png\" width=\"474\" height=\"361\" class=\"mt-image-left\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.62;\"&gt;Renewable energy has been a smart choice for Montanans. Wind energy is one of the lowest cost resources in the portfolio of NorthWestern Energy, which provides electricity to two-thirds of the state. In addition, wind installations &lt;a href=\"http://www.rnp.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/montana%20wind%20power%20factsheet%2012Mar6.pdf\"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Brought over $1.3 billion in new investment to the state,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Created over 1,300 high-paying construction jobs and several dozen permanent jobs,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Contributed over $8 million in tax revenue annually, and&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Paid rural landowners $2 million annually in &lt;a href=\"http://awea.files.cms-plus.com/FileDownloads/pdfs/Montana.pdf\"&gt;land lease payments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Montana also has a small, but rapidly growing, number of solar installations. In fact, rooftop solar installations have grown by almost 330% in the last five years - with a 200% change between 2011 and 2012 alone. The open farmland and high-energy needs of Montana's farms are ideal for solar energy and can provide farmers with significant economic benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter energy use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is another effective way to reduce emissions while growing the economy because smarter energy use lessens the need to generate electricity from fossil fuel-fired power plants that pollute our air and harm our health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And helping people optimize their energy use through such programs as weatherization or rebates for highly efficient appliances costs far less than building new power plants, and is often even cheaper than operating existing power plants. Some of Montana's utilities already run energy efficiency programs. Over five years, NorthWestern Energy's program resulted in a &lt;a href=\"http://psc.mt.gov/Docs/ElectronicDocuments/pdfFiles/D2012-5-49IN13032261352TE.PDF\"&gt;net benefit of $78 million&lt;/a&gt; in reduced utility bills for its customers. For every dollar spent on the programs, customers received $3.70 in benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By just &lt;i&gt;maintaining&lt;/i&gt; utility energy efficiency program spending and savings at current levels between 2017 and 2030, the state &lt;a href=\"https://governor.mt.gov/Portals/16/docs/111dwhitepaperpathways91914-final.pdf\"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that Montanans would save $650 million on their bills and create an additional 375 jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And &lt;i&gt;expanding &lt;/i&gt;energy efficiency investments to achieve twice as much energy efficiency savings as Montana currently does would result in even greater economic benefits, with additional customer bill savings of over $1 billion and the creation of another 530 jobs possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The future is now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Montana's energy future rests in its hands. The Clean Power Plan will let Montana chart a path toward pollution reduction. A smart, effective, and forward-looking state plan to meet Montana's emissions targets will reduce market barriers to - and create new incentives for - clean energy development. The Clean Power Plan is an opportunity for the Treasure State to grow its economy and more fully develop its renewable natural resources in order to create the foundation for a Montana for future generations to call home.&lt;/p&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=eWyMWyGCyF8:xmPBzlFH7Sk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=eWyMWyGCyF8:xmPBzlFH7Sk:dnMXMwOfBR0\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=dnMXMwOfBR0\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=eWyMWyGCyF8:xmPBzlFH7Sk:bcOpcFrp8Mo\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=bcOpcFrp8Mo\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src=\"//feeds.feedburner.com/~r/switchboard_all/~4/eWyMWyGCyF8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/&gt;</content>     <feedburner:origLink>http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/dsullivan/cutting_carbon_pollution_can_d.html</feedburner:origLink></entry>          <entry>         <title type=\"html\">Spring cleaning in the Keystone State: How the Clean Power Plan provides a roadmap for more jobs and cleaner air for Pennsylvania</title>         <link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\" href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~r/switchboard_all/~3/WamzHgCHauQ/spring_cleaning_in_the_keyston.html\" />         <id>tag:switchboard.nrdc.org,2015:/blogs/jmorris//448.18151</id>         <published>2015-03-17T21:28:12Z</published>         <updated>2015-03-17T21:55:59Z</updated>                <summary>             <![CDATA[                 Jackson Morris, Director, Eastern Energy, Danville, Pa.:                  This blog was co-written by my colleague, NRDC Fellow Amanda Levin Springtime has finally arrived in Pennsylvania.

And with the snow finally melted, the birds getting rowdy, and the smell of the trees waking up at last in the air, it's a perfect time to take a fresh look at the clean energy opportunity currently before decision-makers in the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/files/clean-power-plan-state-options-PA.pdf\"&gt;A new factsheet&lt;/a&gt; NRDC released today highlights the huge economic and health benefits of clean energy for Pennsylvania, and provides a helpful guide to the state's compliance options under the EPA's Clean Power Plan to reduce carbon pollution from fossil-fueled power plants. State policies have already helped create a burgeoning clean energy economy here in our state. And Pennsylvania has a substantial opportunity to expand and build on its clean energy achievements, while simultaneously meeting (and even exceeding) its EPA emissions reduction target. Increased investments in clean energy will create new jobs, expand the economy, reduce pollution, lower electric bills, and improve public and environmental health across the state.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Opportunity &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Power plants account for nearly 40 percent of all U.S. carbon emissions. Under the approach proposed by EPA under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, states have been afforded great flexibility in complying with these limits. This flexibility empowers states to design plans that take into account each state's unique economic situation and needs, as well as the ability to pursue a regional, multi-state approach to cutting carbon pollution. As a net exporter of energy, Pennsylvania can see significant benefits from such multi-state approach: In fact, &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/syeh/pjm_regional_cooperation_leads.html\"&gt;a recent study by our regional grid operator, PJM&lt;/a&gt;, (and this helpful &lt;a href=\"http://www.analysisgroup.com/uploadedFiles/Publishing/Articles/Electric_System_Reliability_and_EPAs_Clean_Power_Plan_Case_of_PJM.pdf\"&gt;Analysis Group summary&lt;/a&gt; of that study) show that a mass-based, regional approach would be the most cost-effective and flexible option for the region. Indeed, a regional approach would be about &lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/syeh/pjm_regional_cooperation_leads.html\"&gt;30 percent cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than a patchwork of individual state plans, and would allow Pennsylvania to continue to export power while working with other states to reduce pollution. Or even more simply put by my friend David Weiskopf of NextGen Climate America: &lt;a href=\"http://nextgenamerica.org/epa-rule/keep-it-clean-and-cooperate-new-pjm-report-shows-how-states-can-maximize-benefits-while-cutting-carbon/\"&gt;keep it clean and cooperate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/5647126425_edc716fd25_z.jpg\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"5647126425_edc716fd25_z.jpg\" src=\"http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/jmorris/assets_c/2015/03/5647126425_edc716fd25_z-thumb-500xauto-18981.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"331\" class=\"mt-image-center\" style=\"text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;\" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energy efficiency measures, like the evaporative cooling system on this Grantville farm, can help Pennsylvania create new jobs and cost-effectively comply with the EPA's Clean Power Plan to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from existing power plants. (photo: &lt;span&gt;Lance Cheung for the &lt;/span&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the precise mechanics Pennsylvania ultimately decides to pursue, spurring investment in energy efficiency and renewable wind and solar power should be a central component of the state's plan, as the new NRDC fact sheet issued today shows. Based on NRDC modeling, ramping up energy efficiency and renewable energy would drive the &lt;a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/air/pollution-standards/files/cps-state-benefits-PA.pdf\"&gt;creation of 5,100 new Pennsylvania jobs&lt;/a&gt;, and save residents and businesses an estimated $456 million on their electric bills in 2020 alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Smarter energy use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency is an effective way to reduce pollution while growing the economy because smarter energy use lessens the need to generate electricity from fossil fuel-fired power plants that pollute our air and thus harm our health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency investments create good-paying jobs in manufacturing, construction, and energy auditing and installations. In fact, Pennsylvania already has more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Series/Clean%20Economy/42.PDF\"&gt;118,000 clean energy jobs&lt;/a&gt;, a majority in energy efficiency. With expected future investments in clean energy, this sector is set to expand. Energy efficiency investments have already delivered marked economic and environmental benefits to the state, and now have the added value of being able to play a key part in smart Clean Power Plan compliance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Helping people optimize their energy use through programs such as weatherization or rebates for highly efficient appliances costs far less than building new power plants, and is often even cheaper than operating existing ones. Under Pennsylvania's energy efficiency standard, Act 129, the state's utilities run programs to cut energy waste in homes and businesses. These programs have already &lt;a href=\"http://pfenergycenter.blogspot.com/2014/02/debrief-on-act-129-hearing-in-pa-house.html\"&gt;produced significant energy and bill savings&lt;/a&gt;. PECO customers have saved roughly $331 million and PPL customers have saved at least $428 million over the first 6 years of these programs. In total, the state's residents and business have saved more than $4.2 billion in energy costs. For every dollar utilities spent on energy efficiency, customers received almost $3 in energy benefits alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency programs are low-cost and drive huge benefits to consumers, and Pennsylvania still has vast untapped, low-cost energy efficiency opportunities just waiting to be tapped. In fact, the &lt;a href=\"http://www.puc.pa.gov/electric/pdf/Act129/Act129-PA_Market_Potential_Study051012.pdf\"&gt;state's own analysis&lt;/a&gt; found Pennsylvania could cost-effectively cut another 27 percent of expected future energy use over the next 10 years with only currently available and cost-effective technology. Boosting the state's energy efficiency programs is an easy and cheap way to grow the economy, reduce pollution under the Clean Power Plan, and protect public health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pennsylvania's Renewable Energy Potential&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy is another low-cost option for Pennsylvania to reduce pollution while strengthening our economy. The state already has more than 1,340 megawatts of wind power installed--enough to power more than 1.3 million homes. Wind generation in the state has almost doubled over the last five years and has grown a staggering 1,150 percent in the last 10 years. These &lt;a href=\"http://awea.files.cms-plus.com/FileDownloads/pdfs/Pennsylvania.pdf\"&gt;wind installations&lt;/a&gt; have:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;brought more than $2.7 billion in new capital into the state;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;supported as many as 2,000 jobs; and,&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;provided rural communities with more than $4 million annually through land-lease payments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solar power has also become a profitable industry in our state. Pennsylvania is home to more than &lt;a href=\"http://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/pennsylvania\"&gt;470 solar companies&lt;/a&gt;, with more than 2,300 employees, making the state one of the largest solar employers in the nation. In addition, &lt;a href=\"http://pre.thesolarfoundation.org/solarstates/Pennsylvania\"&gt;more than 33,000 Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt; homes now have solar, placing the state 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; in the nation for household solar installations. In 2013 alone, the solar industry invested more than $144 million in Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The future is now&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Clean Power Plan empowers our state to chart a path forward that can make it a national leader in cleaner, more efficient, and more reliable energy, all while cutting the dangerous carbon pollution that is wrecking our climate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Crafting a plan that maxes out energy efficiency and renewable energy (like wind and solar) will save consumers money on their bills, create jobs, and spur the local economy. The Clean Power Plan is an opportunity for the Keystone State to create the foundation for a Pennsylvania that future generations will want to call home.

Over the last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has held a series of workshops to explore the matter further.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To listen to many critics, meaningfully reducing CO2 emissions from the electricity sector is a nearly impossible task and an untenable reliability risk. But is it really? Haven't we learned anything from integrating large amounts of renewable power into the nation's grid? Is compliance so terribly hard?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well, no, it isn't, according to a number of recent (and not so recent) studies that have shown that transforming the electricity system form dirty fossil generation to zero-pollution renewables not only can be done reliably, it &lt;i&gt;is already being done &lt;/i&gt;in many parts of the country. The managers of some of the largest parts of the U.S. grid believe it is manageable, and though they may advocate tinkering with the timelines a bit, believe that the task is not all that formidable. Other analyses maintain that delays are not even needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the recent National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) meeting in Washington DC, Michael Kormos, executive vice president of the PJM Interconnection, operating the high-voltage grid between New Jersey and Illinois, the nation's largest electricity market, said. \"Given enough time ... we don't necessarily foresee a reliability problem.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=\"http://bit.ly/1FwK9y3\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the highly respected Analysis Group that said that PJM, the largest competitive wholesale electricity market region in the U.S., touching 13 states and the District of Columbia, should not be overly challenged in complying with the Clean Power Plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;\"&lt;i&gt;PJM is well positioned to lower carbon pollution from existing power plants while relying on the reliability tools and operating procedures it uses with great success. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;\" &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;In other words, PJM is already doing it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;In a February &lt;a href=\"http://www.brattle.com/news-and-knowledge/news/790\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on reliability and the Clean Power Plan, the Brattle Group agreed, concluding:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\"Following a review of the reliability concerns raised and the options for mitigating them, we find that compliance with the CPP is unlikely to materially affect reliability. The combination of the ongoing transformation of the power sector, the steps already taken by system operators, the large and expanding set of technological and operational tools available and the flexibility under the CPP are likely sufficient to ensure that compliance will not come at the cost of reliability.\"&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"Default\"&gt;The American Wind Energy Association and the Solar Energy Industry Association have jointly released a &lt;a href=\"http://awea.files.cms-plus.com/FileDownloads/pdfs/Handbook%20for%20States%20final.pdf\"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for states to consider when crafting compliance plans that highlighted the strategies already known and available that allow for compliance with the Clean Power Plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some, like the &lt;a href=\"http://www.wiresgroup.com\"&gt;WIRES&lt;/a&gt; organization and &lt;a href=\"http://cleanenergytransmission.org/\"&gt;Americans for a Clean Energy Grid&lt;/a&gt; (ACEG), are advocating that transmission be emphasized as a compliance strategy as either part of EPA's &lt;a href=\"http://cleanenergytransmission.org/americans-for-a-clean-energy-grid-calls-for-epa-to-recognize-the-value-of-high-voltage-transmission-in-clean-power-plan/\"&gt;third \"building block&lt;/a&gt; (ACEG)\" or as a separate &lt;a href=\"http://www.wiresgroup.com/docs/filings/WIRES%20Comments%20FERC%20Presentation%20on%20CPP.pdf\"&gt;fourth building block&lt;/a&gt; (WIRES). No matter how you slice it, the right transmission can cost-effectively unlock access to low-cost renewables, greatly aiding multi-state compliance strategies. It takes time to build transmission though, so planning for it is essential. WIRES, NRDC, ACEG and many others are advocating that FERC ensure that transmission for Clean Power Plan compliance be prioritized as \"needed\" to meet public policy goals in the agency's \"Order 1000\" regional planning process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite the rhetoric that the Clean Power Plan presents some sort of unprecedentedly complex morass of red tape, my former colleague David Weiskopf has insightfully &lt;a href=\"http://nextgenamerica.org/author/dweiskopf/\"&gt;blogged&lt;/a&gt; that the Clean Power Plan presents regulators with a fairly simple and familiar set of tools with which to attack the carbon pollution problem. Tools they already know and use, and which make the grid more, not less reliable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some reasons the Clean Power Plan is a manifestly manageable challenge:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility ensures reliability. &lt;/b&gt;Because of its flexible design, the Clean Power Plan ensures electric grid reliability.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Clean Power Plan is more flexible than any prior clean air rules, providing many compliance options to maintain reliability. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;States have the tools to keep \"reliability must-run\" plants running. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The Clean Power Plan encourages states to use either rate-based or mass-based approaches, under which averaging and trading of credits or allowances allows flexibility for plants to run if needed to address a local reliability concern (such as a new plant construction delay), while maintaining the overall emission reductions of the program.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;FERC's role in ensuring reliability. &lt;/b&gt;FERC can play an extremely valuable role in helping power sector stakeholders understand the interplay between the Clean Power Plan's flexible design and grid planning and operational procedures to assure reliability. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;FERC and EPA responsibilities. &lt;/b&gt;Throughout the Plan's implementation process, FERC and EPA should follow their well-established, complementary roles: FERC (and the grid planners it regulates) reviews the reliability aspects of the Plan, while EPA, with input from FERC, approves or adjusts state plans on reliability or other grounds.&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;                                       &lt;div class=\"feedflare\"&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://rss.nrdcfeeds.org/~ff/switchboard_all?a=MYqMm-8HGPY:tONo_8LQJRI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/switchboard_all?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
