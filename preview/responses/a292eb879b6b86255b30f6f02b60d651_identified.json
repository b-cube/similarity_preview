Battista, K. Buja, C. Menza, and P. Muller of the Biogeography Branch, the Marshall Islands Marine Resources Authority, and Dean Jacobson of the College of the Marshall Islands\"--Acknowledgements. </General-Note>  <Abstract>\"Digital maps of the shallow (&lt;~30m deep) coral reef ecosystems of Majuro Atoll, Republic of the Marshall Islands, were created through visual interpretation of remote sensing imagery acquired between 2004 and 2006. Reef ecosystem features were digitized directly into a Geographic Information System. Benthic features were categorized according to a classification scheme with attributes including zone (location such as lagoon or forereef, etc.), structure (bottom type such as sand or patch reef, etc.) and percent hard bottom. This atlas consists of 27 detailed maps displaying reef zone and structure of coral ecosystems around Majuro. Adjacent maps in the atlas overlap slightly to ensure complete coverage. Maps and associated products can be used to support science and management activities on Majuro reef ecosystems including inventory, monitoring, conservation, and sustainable development applications. Maps are not to be used for navigation\"--About this atlas. </Abstract>  <System-Details-Note>System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader. </System-Details-Note>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Benthos Habitat Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing Maps. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Marine ecology Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing Maps. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reef ecology Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing Maps. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reefs and islands Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing Maps. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Banks (Oceanography) Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing Maps. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Index-Term-Genre-Form>Remote-sensing maps. lcgft </Index-Term-Genre-Form>  <Added-Entry-Corporate-Name>Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (U.S.).
