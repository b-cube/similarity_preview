Treatments were elevated ozone (AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone Threshold exposure of 40 parts per billion) of 12.86 ppm h) or control conditions (AOT40 of 0.02 ppm h).   ACi curves were carried out mid-way and at the end of the exposure period using a Portable Photosynthesis System, CIRAS (PP-Systems) to calculate the photosynthetic parameters Jmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport) and Vcmax (maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylase activity). The observed decreases in photosynthetic efficiency and capacity in elevated ozone indicate that the ability of such ubiquitous vegetation to act as a sink for atmospheric carbon may be reduced in future climates.

The Climoor field site is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increase temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots(July to September annually). We have measured a range of key community characteristics and processes (ranging from plant diversity to rates of soil respiration) since the experiment began in 1998. In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain). Detailed descriptions of the site (including both vegetation and soil) and treatments are included in the supporting information as well as the methods used, and it is vital that this is considered when re-using this data. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Coordinate reference systems</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Elevation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Climate change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heathland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drought</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>warming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calluna</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vaccinium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Empetrum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>automated roof technology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>shrubland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Clocaenog Forest</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ruthin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NE Wales.</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere-vegetation-soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biweekly to annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03637 Task 11</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03012NEU Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02613 Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03425 Task 9</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02639 Task 2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01735NEW</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-26T14:42:39Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/c9e802b3-43c8-4b36-a3a3-8861d9da8ea9\">     <title>Global ammonia emissions from seabirds</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/c9e802b3-43c8-4b36-a3a3-8861d9da8ea9</link>     <description>The dataset contains three modelled estimates of global ammonia emissions from seabird colonies, at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees latitude/longitude.

It was specifically developed for hydrological application and contain daily time series of Available Precipitation, which is the precipiated water available to hydrological processes after delays due to snow and ice storage are accounted for; and monthly reference Potential Evapotranspiration calculated using the FAO56 method. Future Flows Climate is derived from the Hadley Centre's Regional climate projection ensemble HadRM3-PPE based on 11 different variants of the regional climate model run under the SRES A1B emission scenario. HadRM3-PPE is underpinning the UKCP09 products. Bias correction and spatial downscaling were applied to the total precpitation and air temperature variables before Future Flows Climate APr and PE were generated. The development of Future Flows Climate was made during the partnership project 'Future Flows and Groundwater Levels' funded by the Environment Agency for England and Wales, Defra, UK Water Research Industry, NERC (Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and British Geological Survey) and Wallingford HydroSolutions.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Rick Stuart</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-29T13:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b7caa4f-4e35-4c79-aa8e-2e065234a14a\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century Rainf GPCC (Rainfall GPCC) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b7caa4f-4e35-4c79-aa8e-2e065234a14a</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models. It consists of three/six-hourly states of the weather for global half-degree land grid points. It was generated as part of the EU FP 6 project \"WATCH\" (WATer and global CHange\") which ran from 2007-2011. The data was generated in 2 tranches with slightly different methodology: 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, but generally the dataset can be considered as continuous.  More details regarding the generation process can be found in the associated WATCH technical report and paper in J. Hydrometeorology.   To understand how the data grid is formed it is necessary to read the attached WFD-land-long-lat-z files either in NetCDF or DAT formats.   The data covers land points only and excludes the Antarctica.   Rainf or rainfall rate is the rainfall rate based on the GPCC bias corrected, undercatch corrected measured in kg/m2/s at 3 hourly resolution averaged over the next 3 hours and at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. Please note that there is also a WFD Rainf CRU bias corrected dataset, but as the GPCC dataset is the preferred dataset only this rainfall dataset is available from this gateway. These rainfall datasets contain rainfall data only and need to be combined with the respective WFD snowfall datasets to obtain precipitation data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rainf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rainfall rate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31dd5dd3-85b7-45f3-96a3-6e6023b0ad61\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century SWdown (Surface incident shortwave radiation) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31dd5dd3-85b7-45f3-96a3-6e6023b0ad61</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.

The data was generated in 2 tranches with slightly different methodology: 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, but generally the dataset can be considered as continuous.  More details regarding the generation process can be found in the associated WATCH technical report and paper in J. Hydrometeorology.   To understand how the data grid is formed it is necessary to read the attached WFD-land-long-lat-z files either in NetCDF or DAT formats.   The data covers land points only and excludes the Antarctica.   Wind or near surface wind speed at 10m is the  near surface wind speed at 10m in m/s-1 at 6 hourly resolution and 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>6-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wind</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wind speed</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/8ebdd74c-ffec-4d5f-b832-e4916df694c8\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century PSurf (Surface pressure) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/8ebdd74c-ffec-4d5f-b832-e4916df694c8</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.

Snowf or snowfall is the snowfall rate based on the GPCC bias corrected, undercatch corrected measured in kg/m2/s at 3 hourly resolution averaged over the next 3 hours and at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution.   Please note that there is also a WFD Snowf CRU bias corrected dataset, but as the GPCC dataset is the preferred dataset only this snowfall dataset is available from this gateway. These snowfall datasets contain snowfall data only and need to be combined with the respective WFD rainfall datasets to obtain precipitation data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Snowf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Snowfall rate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century  LWdown (Surface incident longwave radiation) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.
