Purpose: KRAS is the most commonly mutated oncogene in human tumours. KRAS-mutant cells&#13; may exhibit resistance to the allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244; ARRY-&#13; 142886) and allosteric AKT inhibitors (such as MK-2206), the combination of which may&#13; overcome resistance to both monotherapies.&#13; Experimental Design: We conducted a dose/schedule-finding study evaluating MK-2206 and&#13; selumetinib in patients with advanced treatment-refractory solid tumours. Recommended dosing&#13; schedules were defined as MK-2206 135 mg weekly and selumetinib 100 mg once-daily.&#13; Results: Grade 3 rash was the most common dose-limiting toxicity (DLT); other DLTs included&#13; grade 4 lipase increase, grade 3 stomatitis, diarrhoea, and fatigue, and grade 3 and grade 2 retinal&#13; pigment epithelium detachment. There were no meaningful pharmacokinetic drug-drug&#13; interactions. Clinical anti-tumour activity included RECIST 1.0-confirmed partial responses in&#13; non-small cell lung cancer and low-grade ovarian carcinoma.&#13; Conclusion: Responses in KRAS-mutant cancers were generally durable. Clinical co-targeting of&#13; MEK and AKT signalling may be an important therapeutic strategy in KRAS-driven human&#13; malignancies (Trial NCT number NCT01021748).

A.; Philpott, Anna During central nervous system (CNS) development, hundreds of distinct neuronal subtypes are generated from a single layer of multipotent neuroepithelial progenitor cells. Within the rostral CNS, initial regionalization of the telencephalon marks the territories where the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia originate. Subsequent refinement of the primary structures determines the formation of domains of differential gene expression, where distinct fate-restricted progenitors are located. To understand how diversification of neural progenitors and neurons is achieved in the telencephalon, it is important to address early and late patterning events in this context. In particular, important questions include: How does the telencephalon become specified and regionalized along the major spatial axes? Within each region, are the differences in neuronal subtypes established at the progenitor level or at the postmitotic stage? If distinct progenitors exist that are committed to subtype-specific neuronal lineages, how does the diversification emerge? What is the contribution of positional and temporal cues and how is this information integrated into the intrinsic programs of cell identity? This is the accepted manuscript.

E.; Albertini, F.; Thomas, S. J.; Lomax, A. J. Aim: To define a site-specific robustness protocol to be used during the clinical plan evaluation process.&#13; Method: Plan robustness of 16 skull base IMPT plans to systematic range and random set-up errors have been retrospectively and systematically analysed. This was determined by calculating the error-bar dose distribution (ebDD) for all the plans and by defining some metrics used to define protocols aiding the plan assessment. Additionally, an example of how to clinically use the defined robustness database is given whereby a plan with sub-optimal brainstem robustness was identified. The advantage of using different beam arrangements to improve the plan robustness was analysed.&#13; Results: Using the ebDD it was found range errors had a smaller effect on dose distribution than the corresponding set-up error in a single fraction, and that organs at risk were most robust to the range errors, whereas the target was more robust to set-up errors. A database was created to aid planners in terms of plan robustness aims in these volumes. This resulted in the definition of site-specific robustness protocols. The use of robustness constraints allowed for the identification of a specific patient that may have benefited from a treatment of greater individuality. A new beam arrangement showed to be preferential when balancing conformality and robustness for this case.&#13; Conclusions: The ebDD and error-bar volume histogram proved effective in analysing plan robustness. The process of retrospective analysis could be used to establish site-specific robustness planning protocols in proton therapy. These protocols allow the planner to determine plans that, although delivering a dosimetrically adequate dose distribution, have resulted in sub-optimal robustness to these uncertainties. For these cases the use of different beam start conditions may improve the plan robustness to set-up and range uncertainties. This is the accepted manuscript.

Raza; Dawson, Sarah-Jane; Le Quesne, John; Provenzano, Elena; Caldas, Carlos; Pharoah, Paul D. P. Sectioning a whole tissue microarrray (TMA block) and storing the sections maximises the number of sections obtained, but may impair the antigenicity of the stored sections.  We have investigated the impact of TMA section storage on antigenicity.&#13; First, we re-examined existing TMA data to determine whether antigenicity in stored sections changes over time.  Component scores for each marker, based on cellular compartment of staining and score-type, were evaluated separately.  Residual components scores adjusted for grade, tumour size and node positivity, were regressed on the number of days storage to evaluate the effect of storage time. Storage time ranged from 2 to 1897 days, and the mean change in antigenicity per year ranged from -0.88 (95%CI -1.11 to -0.65) to 0.035 (95%CI 0.016 to 0.054).  Further analysis showed no significant improvement in the fit of survival models if storage time adjusted scores were included in the models rather than unadjusted scores. &#13; We then compared three ways of processing TMA sections after cutting \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd immediate staining, staining after one year and staining after one year coated in wax \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd on the IHC results for: progesterone receptor (PGR), a routinely-used, robust antibody, and MKI67, which is generally considered less robust.  The PGR scores for stored sections were similar to those for un-stored sections while the MKI67 scores for stored sections were substantially different to those for un-stored sections. Wax coating made little difference to the results.&#13;  Biomarker antigenicity shows a small decline over time which is unlikely to have an important effect on studies of prognostic biomarkers.
