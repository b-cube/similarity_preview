The data are aggregated into 5-year intervals.  The data are stratified by county of residence, maternal age , maternal race/ethnicity and infant gender.  The data are from an active surveillance system that ascertains birth defects among live births, fetal deaths, and terminations, using ICD-9 codes.&#13; &#13; </abstract> <purpose>To provide data that is consistent with the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network guidance for creating Nationally Consistent Data and Measures (NCDMs) for birth defects.</purpose> <supplinf>These data were provided by the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program (CBDMP).

CBDMP currently monitors a subset, over 40% of annual births in California, which represents the state\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds geographic, environmental and racial/ethnic diversity. The CBDMP registry data are used for ongoing surveillance to monitor rates and trends of select birth defects. &#13; &#13; </procdesc> <procdate>20140624</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>CEHTP obtained data from CBDMP on 12 select birth defects aggregated by year of birth, county, maternal age, maternal race, maternal ethnicity, and infant gender.  CEHTP aggregated the data into 5-year intervals and created this dataset to be used for public health surveillance, while maintaining confidentiality.  This dataset on the CEHTP portal includes counts, rates, and confidence intervals for the 12 select birth defects by 5-year aggregation, county, and by one of the following demographic groups: maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, and infant gender. Hypospadias counts and rates are available for male infants only, not for female infants or both sexes.  Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) counts and rates are available by all maternal ages combined, mothers less than 35 years old, and mothers greater than or equal to 35 years old. To calculate 5-year rates, we use birth data provided by CBDMP.  Confidence intervals for birth defect rates are calculated using the modified Wilson's score method (Croarkin C and Tobias P, Sect 7.2.4.1: Confidence Intervals.
