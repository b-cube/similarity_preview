Each point represents a unique detection during survey counts and consists of information pertaining to species and breeding status. This dataset was derived from single-visit rapid area shorebird surveys in which 1-2 surveyors recorded all suspected breeding shorebirds within the plot boundary.  These data were acquired over the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska during nine years between 1998 and 2008 (surveys not conducted in 2003 and 2005).</abstract> <purpose>This dataset was developed with the intention of estimating breeding abundance, distribution, and habitat associations of shorebirds across the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska.</purpose> <supplinf> Dataset Limitations: As PRISM protocols were being developed over the course of this study, methods for plot selection varied among years.  In early years (1998 - 2001), plots were randomly selected in the NPR-A within habitat strata (wetland and upland), where plot boundaries followed natural borders between wetlands and uplands (excluding unsuitable habitat [e.g., open water, mudflats]), resulting in variable plot sizes (2 - 342 ha) and shapes.  In later years (2002 - 2008), plot sizes were restricted to 400 x 400 m2 square plots (16 ha) and were primarily located randomly, with a few plots located nonrandomly.  For logistical reasons, in 2001, 2002, and 2004, plots were located in 2- and 3- plot clusters, where second and third plots were selected randomly within 1 - 5 km from the initial plot.  Furthermore, in early years, search effort (i.e., amount of time spent surveying plot) was not standardized among plots.  Thus, differences in plot selection method, clustering of plots, size and shape of plots, and survey effort may influence comparability of shorebird abundance, occupancy, and species richness among plots or years. Additionally, in 2006, a portion of plots originally surveyed in 2001 within the NPR-A were surveyed again as part of a project to monitor avian influenza.  For these repeat sampled plots, all shorebird observations (i.e., from both surveys) are represented in this data file.  When interpreting these data, the user should be aware that the detectability of shorebirds is a function of many variables, including differences in species, habitat, time-of-year, weather conditions, survey effort, and individual surveyor. During surveys, surveyors recorded locations of individual sightings by either recording coordinates obtained using a handheld GPS unit or drawing locations on aerial photographs or plot maps.  When no GPS coordinate was obtained, points were placed using ArcGIS and field maps.  Specifically, points were visually placed as close as possible to the location marked on field maps using ArcGIS and habitat features seen on aerial photographs or distance from plot boundaries.  Therefore, greater accuracy of point locations should be given to these points obtained using handheld GPS units, and less so to those placed using ArcGIS.  Thus, caution should be used when interpreting these data, as the accuracy is a factor of the accuracy of the GPS units, points marked by surveyors on aerial photographs or within plot boundaries, and placement of points in ArcGIS based on field maps and aerial photographs.  Methodology During 9 years between 1998 and 2008 (surveys not conducted in 2003 and 2005), ground surveys were conducted as part of the Program for Regional and International Shorebird Monitoring (PRISM).  As PRISM protocols were being developed over the course of this study, methods for plot selection varied among years.  Detailed descriptions of plot selection methods for 1998 - 2004 can be found in Bart and Earnst (2002), Brown et al. (2007), Johnson et al. (2007), and Bart et al. (2012).  Briefly, in early years (1998 ?- 2001), plots were randomly selected in the NPR-A within habitat strata (wetland and upland), where plot boundaries followed natural borders between wetlands and uplands (excluding unsuitable habitat [e.g., open water, mudflats]), resulting in variable plot sizes (2 - 342 ha) and shapes.  In later years (2002 - 2008), plot sizes were restricted to 400 x 400 m2 square plots (16 ha) and were primarily located randomly, with a few plots located nonrandomly.  In 2002 and 2004, plots were located within the ANWR and west to the Colville River (eastern boarder of the NPR-A) independent of habitat type (in 2002) or based on stratified habitat types (in 2004; riparian, flooded, very wet, and upland developed from Jorgenson et al. [1994] ).  For logistical reasons, in 2001, 2002, and 2004, plots were located in 2- and 3- plot clusters, where second and third plots were selected randomly within 1 - 5 km from the initial plot.  In 2006, a portion of plots originally surveyed in 2001 within the NPR-A were surveyed again as part of a project to monitor avian influenza.  In 2007 and 2008, plots were randomly located within the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA) of the NPR-A.  To ensure plots were surveyed throughout the entire region, we divided the TLSA into 4 geographic areas (NW, NE, SE, and SW) based on predominant land cover types defined for the NPR-A by Ducks Unlimited, Inc. (1998).  Within each geographic area, plots were selected randomly proportional to the relative area.  Plot locations were restricted in both 2007 and 2008 so as not to be the same as those sampled in 2001, and plot locations in 2008 so as not to be the same as plots sampled in 2007. In all years, shorebirds were surveyed during pre- and early incubation periods (i.e., 7 June - 1 July) when breeding shorebirds were most detectable.  Surveys were conducted using a single-visit, rapid area search technique, where 1 - 2 surveyors systematically traversed each plot and recorded the presence of all suspected breeding shorebirds within the plot boundary.  An individual bird's behavior (e.g., territorial and courtship displays, attachment to the plot) was used to assess whether the pair was likely breeding in or very near the plot.  Transient birds (e.g., flyovers) were not included in counts. During surveys, surveyors recorded locations of individual sightings by either recording coordinates obtained using a handheld GPS unit or drawing locations on aerial photographs or plot maps.  When no GPS coordinate was obtained, points were placed using ArcGIS and field maps.  Specifically, points were visually placed as close as possible to the location marked on field maps using ArcGIS and habitat features seen on aerial photographs or distance from plot boundaries.
