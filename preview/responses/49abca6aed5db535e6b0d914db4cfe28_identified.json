Potholes carved into streambeds can be important components of channel incision, but they have received little quantitative attention. Here empirical evidence is presented from three sites along the Orange River, Republic of South Africa that demonstrates that the pothole dimensions of radius and depth are strongly correlated using a simple power law. Where radius is the dependent variable, the exponent of the power law describes the rate of increase in radius with increasing depth. Erosion within potholes is complexly related to erosion on the adjacent bed. Erosion efficiencies within small, hemispherical potholes must be high if the potholes are to survive in the face of bed translation (incision). As potholes deepen, however, the necessary efficiencies decline rapidly. Increasing concavity associated with growth imposes stricter constraints; comparatively deep potholes must erode orders of magnitude larger volumes of substrate than shallower potholes in the face of bed retreat. Hemispherical potholes are eventually converted to cylindrical potholes, the geometries of which favor enlargement while they are small. Geometric models constructed using the power law show unambiguously that more substrate is eroded by volume from cylindrical pothole walls during growth than from cylindrical pothole floors. Grinders thus play a secondary role to suspended sediment entrained within the vortices that occur in potholes. Continued growth leads to coalescence with other potholes or destruction through block detachment depending on local geology. The combination of geology and erosion mechanisms may determine whether a strath or inner channel develops as a consequence of the process. </summary> <dc:date>2006-12-06T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Forms and processes of two highly contrasting rivers in arid central Australia, and the implications for channel-pattern discrimination and prediction</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11887\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Tooth, Stephen</name> </author> <author> <name>Nanson, G.

C. Description and quantification of the diverse controls on alluvial-river styles have long been key themes in the fluvial literature, but many uncertainties and contentions remain. On the Northern Plains in arid central Australia, ephemeral rivers are commonly low sinuosity (P &lt;1.15) but vary from single thread to anabranching, thus providing an opportunity to examine concepts of channel-pattern discrimination and prediction. Comparison of the closely adjacent middle reaches of the Plenty and Marshall Rivers demonstrates that although channel-bed gradient, discharge, and bank strength are essentially similar, bed-material caliber and the pattern of tributary drainage are markedly different. These differences result in strong contrasts in channel cross-sectional geometry and planform. The Plenty River, which transports medium to coarse sand and is joined by few tributaries, remains predominantly single thread but is variably wide (100\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1200 m) and in places appears transitional to braiding. By contrast, the Marshall River, which transports coarse sand to granules and is joined by several minor tributaries, has numerous narrow (usually Tooth, S., Nanson, G. C. (2004).

S. Previous studies of alluvial rivers have shown that channel patterns form a continuum controlled by interactions among factors such as gradient, discharge, sediment size, and bank strength. Data from channels in the permanent wetlands of the Okavango Delta add to these findings by focusing on pattern transitions in channels with banks formed by sedges and grasses that are rooted in peat and underlain by unconsolidated sediment. Channels are well defined, and transport fine-medium sand as bedload between the vertical, vegetation-lined banks. Water depths, velocities, grain sizes, and bankline vegetation do not vary significantly or systematically downstream, but the permeable banks allow water to leak from the channels, contributing to an overall downstream decrease in discharge and width. In addition, as the Okavango River flows from the 2\\ufffd\\ufffd0), but further downstream in the Fan, the narrower ( 10), thalweg meandering results in scour of the unconsolidated sediment at the bank base, leading to undermining and collapse of the vegetation, and to slow meander migration. However, as channels narrow downstream (w/d &lt;10) with discharge losses, proportionally increasing sidewall drag exerted by bankline vegetation suppresses thalweg meandering and bank scour, and channels follow stable, less sinuous courses.

S. Anabranching is characteristic of a number of rivers in diverse environmental settings worldwide, but has only infrequently been described from bedrock-influenced rivers. A prime example of a mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching river is provided by a 150-km long reach of the Orange River above Augrabies Falls, Northern Cape Province, South Africa. Here, the perennial Orange flows through arid terrain consisting mainly of Precambrian granites and gneisses, and the river has preferentially eroded bedrock joints, fractures and foliations to form multiple channels which divide around numerous, large (up to 15 km long and 2 km wide), stable islands formed of alluvium and/or bedrock. Significant local variations in channel-bed gradient occur along the river, which strongly control anabranching style through an influence on local sediment budgets. In relatively long (&gt;10 km), lower gradient reaches (0.0013) within the anabranching reach, local transport capacity exceeds sediment supply, bedrock crops out extensively, and channels flow over an irregular bedrock pavement or divide around rocky islands. Channel incision into bedrock probably occurs mainly by abrasion, with the general absence of boulder bedforms suggesting that hydraulic plucking is relatively unimportant in this setting. Mixed bedrock-alluvial anabranching also occurs in a number of other rivers worldwide, and appears to be a stable and often long-lived river pattern adjusted to a number of factors commonly acting in combination: (1) jointed/fractured granitoid rock outcrop; (2) erosion-resistant banks and islands; (3) locally variable channel-bed gradients; (4) variable flow regimes. </summary> <dc:date>2004-02-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
