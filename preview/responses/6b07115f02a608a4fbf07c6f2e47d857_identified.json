Survey information in this module focused on issues that affected overall health, such as specific conditions, physical functioning, aid received from family members or friends when needed, and lifestyle choices. Topics included activities respondents were able to perform and how they were affected socially in light of specific physical and mental health conditions. Respondents were asked to provide health conditions they were suffering from, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and how these conditions were limiting with respect to general health, physical functioning, emotional and mental health, as well as social functioning. Other topics included participation and frequency of lifestyle habits that affected overall health, as well as how often respondents visited the doctor. Respondents were also queried on whether they sought out alternative, non-traditional homeopathic care and whether family, friends, or co-workers listened to their personal problems and provided support financially. Additional topics include the environment and pollution, neighborhood amenities, fear of aging, addiction, and body image. Demographic information specific to the respondent and their spouse includes age, sex, marital status, education, employment status and hours worked, occupation, earnings and income, religion, class, size of community, and region.         </abstract>                 <abstract>                    The purpose of this study was to provide students and scholars in the social science community with integrated East Asian Social Survey datasets collected by coordinated efforts of the participating institutions in China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.           </abstract>                             <abstract>                                                <p>For information on study design, users should refer to the Original P.I.
