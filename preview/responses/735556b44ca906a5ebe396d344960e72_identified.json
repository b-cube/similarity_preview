Total phosphorus concentration data was gathered for the full duration of the project. Soluble reactive phosphorus, total oxidisable nitrogen and dissolved reactive silicon concentration was only gathered from Jan 2005 until Feb 2006.  Sampling interval varied throughout the monitoring period, from a minimum of two samples to day, to eight per day during storm events (with an average of three samples per day throughout the duration of the monitoring period).  Samples were taken from the main flow of the river using an automatic water sampler, and analysed using standard colorometric methods, at the CEH Dorset laboratories.

A long term landscape scale grassland restoration and re-creation project has been underway at the site since 2000). 200m long transects located in the centre of different grassland re-creation fields of different ages, arable land, chalk grassland fragments on slopes and on ancient burial mounds, and semi-improved pasture. Transects were surveyed on three occasions spread across the field season (June to September), and throughout the day and were selected ad-hoc for survey in order to minimise the effect that the time of year and day would have on results. During the survey, the transect was walked at a slow, steady pace allowing five minutes for each 20m section of transect and the number and species of Lepidoptera present 5m either side and ahead were recorded. If Lepidoptera were observed feeding, then the nectar plant species was also recorded. Habitat quality, defined in terms of vegetation characteristics and nectar resources, was quantified throughout each transect by sampling quadrats in each 20m segment of the transect. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae). The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the National Trust.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>day flying moths</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland restoration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wiltshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stonehenge</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-30T09:12:02Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from chalk grassland fragment boundaries within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, in 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera from chalk grassland fragments at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, in 2011. The landscape consists of small fragments of ancient chalk grassland on slopes and groups of burial mounds (barrows) which have retained many of the characteristic chalk grassland plant and butterfly species. Surveys were located at four of these chalk grassland fragments. At each chalk grassland fragment, four 20 m long survey boundaries, were set up on boundaries with adjacent land cover of either arable land or new grassland re-creation sown in the years 2009 or 2010. Control surveys were also carried out in areas of continuous habitat within the chalk grassland fragment and in the adjoining land cover type. Surveys of Lepidoptera behaviour were carried out from May to July between 10am and 4pm and effort was taken to survey the same site at different times of the day in order to minimise the effect of survey time on behaviour. Standing at the chalk grassland fragment edge the flight path of individual Lepidoptera was tracked in the survey area for up to three minutes. Measures of vegetation characteristics and nectar flower availability were recorded for each plot. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae).

The landscape consisted of a mosaic of chalk grassland fragments on ancient burial mounds (barrows) and slopes, grassland re-creation fields of different ages since sowing, semi-improved pasture, arable farmland and woodland. In one of the grassland re-creation fields, two large areas were mown and eight 20 m long survey boundaries were set up. Four of these were set up on the edge of one of two mown areas and four were set up in areas of continuous un-mown grass which had dummy 'boundaries' parallel to the mown boundaries. The survey was conducted from the survey boundary and the flight path of individual Lepidoptera was tracked in the area 10 m either side of the survey boundary. Each individual Lepidoptera flight path was surveyed for three minutes. Each boundary was surveyed for a total of 20 minutes on three occasions over a five week period. The sequence of boundaries surveyed was chosen randomly and equal survey effort was allocated to visually searching both sides of the boundary. The order and time of day for surveying each survey area was random so to spread surveys throughout the survey period and throughout the day. Measures of vegetation characteristics and nectar flower availability were recorded for survey areas. Recorded vegetation characteristics included vegetation height and density. Nectar flower availability was measured as the number of flowering units of nectar flowers and numbers of those in the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Dipsacaceae families. The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the National Trust.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>day flying moths</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland restoration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wiltshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stonehenge</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-29T16:54:25Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e54069b6-71a9-4b36-837f-a5e3ee65b4de\">     <title>Arable crop yield data for the Hillesden Experimental Platform, UK, collected between 2006 and 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e54069b6-71a9-4b36-837f-a5e3ee65b4de</link>     <description>This dataset contains yield data for wheat, oilseed rape and field beans grown in fields under different agri-environment practices. The fields were located at the Hillesden Estate in Buckinghamshire, UK, where a randomised block experiment had been implemented to examine the effects of converting differing proportions of arable land to wildlife habitat. The fields were planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) followed by break crops of either oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) or field beans (Vicia faba L.). Three treatments were applied at random: a control (\"business as usual\"), Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) treatment and ELS Extra treatment. The ELS treatment involved removing 1% of land to create wildlife habitats. The ELS Extra had a greater proportion of land removed (6%) and additional wildlife habitats included. The total yield of each crop was measured at the time of harvesting using a yield meter attached to the combine harvester. From these values, yield per hectare and the ratio of crop yield to regional average yield were calculated.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>OSR</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>field beans</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter wheat</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brassica napus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vicia faba</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Triticum aestivum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hillesden</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Buckinghamshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T10:48:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/571a676f-6c32-489b-b7ec-18dcc617a9f1\">     <title>UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/571a676f-6c32-489b-b7ec-18dcc617a9f1</link>     <description>This is a series of datasets available from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). The UKBMS comprises a suite of surveys carried out each year across the UK that generate data on butterfly abundance. The UKBMS started in 1976 (few sites from 1973) with thirty-six sites increasing to over a thousand by 2010. On the majority of these sites, recorders walk a fixed route (divided into up to 15 sections) at their site every week from 1st April to 29th September (total of 26 weeks), each year, counting butterflies within defined limits (5m box) when weather meets certain criteria. On some sites different survey techniques are employed to assess the abundance of species. These techniques include timed counts and larval web surveys in fixed areas. Weather data is recorded at the time of the count and habitat data is available for most transects. The surveys are undertaken by volunteers and other recorders, who contribute their data free of charge. The scheme is operated as a partnership between the Centre For Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC), and is jointly sponsored by a multi-agency consortium of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Natural Environment Research Council (through CEH), BC, Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Countryside Council for Wales, Natural England, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage. UKBMS data is widely used for research; a list of publications as well as downloadable PDF copies of past Annual Reports is made available via the UKBMS website. Datasets currently available for download are yearly calculations of species trends and collated indices of abundance, as well as yearly updated site data. Access to the full dataset should be requested directly from the UKBMS.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-06T09:13:09Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d</link>     <description>Collated indices are a relative measure of butterfly abundance across monitored sites in the UK, calculated from data collected by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Collated indices are calculated annually for each individual butterfly species that has been recorded on five or more sites in that year. Based on this criterion collated indices have been calculated for the entire UKBMS time series from 1976 to the current year for the majority of species. For some rarer species the time series starts in a later year due to lack of data. Collated indices are calculated using a statistical model that accounts for missing data. The number of sites for each species ranges from 5 to several hundred and varies from year to year. Since 2008 more than 1,000 sites have been monitored across the UK each year. Collated indices are calculated so that we can determine how butterfly populations are changing over time across the UK. This data can be used, for example, to determine where to target conservation efforts and to measure the condition of the UK countryside. Butterflies are recognised as important indicators of biodiversity and environmental change (e.g. as official UK Biodiversity Indicators), and have been used in numerous research studies to understand the impacts of changes in climate and the extent and condition of habitats. Although the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of the Collated indices, the collection of the data used in their creation is ultimately reliant on a large volunteer community.

In addition a trend class, based on slope direction and its significance, and a percentage change for that time period are provided to describe the statistical trends. These trend data are provided for 59 UK butterfly species. Trends across different time series allow us to determine the long and short-term trends for individual species. This is enables us to focus conservation and research and also to assess species responses to conservation already in place. The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of this trend datasets. The collection of the underlying UKBMS data is reliant on a large volunteer community.

Data includes the location within the UK, the length and width of the line transect on each site, and how long the transect has been monitored. The UKBMS started in 1976 with fewer than 50 sites. The number of sites monitored each year has increased to over a thousand since 2008. There is turnover in sites monitored each year and details of the first and last year in which each site was surveyed are given. The majority of site data is provided by recorders at the time a transect is created. The majority of these recorders are volunteers.

National level vegetation surveys were conducted in May 1986, October 1986 and Spring 1987. More intensive surveys of vegetation (grass and heather) and wildlife (grouse, fox, etc.) in restricted areas were carried out in Cumbria, Wales and North Yorkshire in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1993. Surveys of fungi were carried out between 1994 and 1997. The data are suitable for interpolation to create spatially variable surfaces suitable for input into models.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chernobyl</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deposition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>accident</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radiocaesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>North Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Yorkshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>GB</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fungi</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wildlife</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grasses</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heather</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pollution &amp; Environmental Risk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-25T09:02:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/8af983e4-e97d-4c07-a34d-753243fa283b\">     <title>Antiviral, antibiotics and decongestants in wastewater treatment plants and receiving rivers in the Thames catchment</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/8af983e4-e97d-4c07-a34d-753243fa283b</link>     <description>This dataset contains the concentration of eleven antibiotics (trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin), three decongestants (naphazoline, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline) and the antiviral drug oseltamivir's  active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate, measured at 21 locations within the River Thames catchment in England. The measurements were taken weekly during November 2009, once in March 2010 and once in May 2011, with the aim to quantify pharmaceutical usage during the influenza pandemic of 2009 and how this compares to inter-pandemic drug use. River samples were acquired by grab samples in glass jars and analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS). Two wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in southern England (Benson and Oxford) were also sampled during the peak of the second wave of the 2009 influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 pandemic (10-11 November 2009) and on 15 May 2011 using an automated sampler set to acquired hourly (time proportional) samples from the influent and effluent of the WWTPs. The WWTPs are the source for all the drugs found in the river, hence, these were studied to understand the differential fate of the analytes in the two very different WWTPs. Flows for the WWTP and River sampling locations are presented for each of the sampling times to allow for determining hourly loads for the WWTP and daily loads for the river.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pandemic</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>influenza</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>antibiotic</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>antiviral</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>decongestant</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wastewater treatment plant</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>River Thames</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wastewater epidemiology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Thames Catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Benson Sewage Works</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oxford Sewage Works</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-01T14:21:43Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ada39609-ddec-4cbe-85c2-4fdd6bd774d7\">     <title>Cleaned UK Rainfall Chemistry Data (1986 - 2011)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ada39609-ddec-4cbe-85c2-4fdd6bd774d7</link>     <description>These data are based on the UK rainfall chemistry data held on the UK-AIR database operated on behalf of Defra (http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/). A subset of 20 sites was analysed, being those with the longest continuous data record from 1986 to 2011. Rainfall samples from bulk collectors were taken weekly or two-weekly at sites across the UK and analyzed by a central laboratory. The raw reported data contain some samples which were contaminated by bird droppings, or by wind-blown dust, and should not be used to estimate annual or long-term wet deposition at the measurement sites. Some samples were missing for other reasons, such as physical loss of the rain sample prior to analysis. Following identification and removal of contaminated sample data, the missing data were estimated, where possible, using statistical interpolation across both time and space with the GENSTAT procedure MULTMISSING. The final datasets contain the accepted and estimated data values, flagged as appropriate.  The dataset names correspond to the sites as listed in the UK-AIR database. This cleaned dataset was prepared by Neil Cape, Ron Smith and David Leaver at CEH Edinburgh on behalf of Defra and the Devolved Administrations under the project Pollutant Deposition Processes.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>David Leaver</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>cleaned dataset</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK National Rainfall Chemistry Network</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>PrecipNet</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-07-15T10:59:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/91961a0f-3158-4d00-984d-91eb1e03e8bd\">     <title>Plynlimon research catchments </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/91961a0f-3158-4d00-984d-91eb1e03e8bd</link>     <description>This is a series of spatial and time series datasets including river networks, digital terrain model, soils, meteorology, river flow and hydro-chemistry.The Plynlimon research catchments lie within the headwaters of the River Severn and the River Wye in the uplands of mid-Wales.
