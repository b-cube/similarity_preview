The AWS was installed at the Bowl study site, an area of improved grassland, between 2006-2010 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. The parameters measured by the AWS were; incident radiation, wind speed and direction, soil and air temperature, relative humidity and net radiation. All sensors are sampled every 1 minute and provided in the form of daily and 10 minute averages. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and generally split into 6 month blocks. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Details of the dataset and the quality assurance coding system (Appendix A) are provided in the supporting documentation. Other measurements taken at the Bowl include monitoring runoff from an improved grassland field in the form of overland and drain flow, soil water tension, soil volumetric moisture content, groundwater height and precipitation. Datasets of these other parameters are also provided by EIDC Hub.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:40:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b7caa4f-4e35-4c79-aa8e-2e065234a14a\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century Rainf GPCC (Rainfall GPCC) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b7caa4f-4e35-4c79-aa8e-2e065234a14a</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models. It consists of three/six-hourly states of the weather for global half-degree land grid points. It was generated as part of the EU FP 6 project \"WATCH\" (WATer and global CHange\") which ran from 2007-2011. The data was generated in 2 tranches with slightly different methodology: 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, but generally the dataset can be considered as continuous.  More details regarding the generation process can be found in the associated WATCH technical report and paper in J. Hydrometeorology.   To understand how the data grid is formed it is necessary to read the attached WFD-land-long-lat-z files either in NetCDF or DAT formats.   The data covers land points only and excludes the Antarctica.   Rainf or rainfall rate is the rainfall rate based on the GPCC bias corrected, undercatch corrected measured in kg/m2/s at 3 hourly resolution averaged over the next 3 hours and at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. Please note that there is also a WFD Rainf CRU bias corrected dataset, but as the GPCC dataset is the preferred dataset only this rainfall dataset is available from this gateway. These rainfall datasets contain rainfall data only and need to be combined with the respective WFD snowfall datasets to obtain precipitation data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rainf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rainfall rate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31dd5dd3-85b7-45f3-96a3-6e6023b0ad61\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century SWdown (Surface incident shortwave radiation) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31dd5dd3-85b7-45f3-96a3-6e6023b0ad61</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.

Qair or 2m specific humidity (instantaneous) is the instantaneous specific humidity at 2m measured in kg/kg at 6 hourly resolution and 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Qair</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Specific humidity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b7a08f0-00f7-4c48-ac4d-e483acb77a03\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century Snowf GPCC (Snowfall GPCC) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b7a08f0-00f7-4c48-ac4d-e483acb77a03</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models. It consists of three/six-hourly states of the weather for global half-degree land grid points. It was generated as part of the EU FP 6 project \"WATCH\" (WATer and global CHange\") which ran from 2007-2011. The data was generated in 2 tranches with slightly different methodology: 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, but generally the dataset can be considered as continuous.  More details regarding the generation process can be found in the associated WATCH technical report and paper in J. Hydrometeorology.   To understand how the data grid is formed it is necessary to read the attached WFD-land-long-lat-z files either in NetCDF or DAT formats.   The data covers land points only and excludes the Antarctica.   Snowf or snowfall is the snowfall rate based on the GPCC bias corrected, undercatch corrected measured in kg/m2/s at 3 hourly resolution averaged over the next 3 hours and at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution.   Please note that there is also a WFD Snowf CRU bias corrected dataset, but as the GPCC dataset is the preferred dataset only this snowfall dataset is available from this gateway. These snowfall datasets contain snowfall data only and need to be combined with the respective WFD rainfall datasets to obtain precipitation data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Snowf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Snowfall rate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century  LWdown (Surface incident longwave radiation) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.
