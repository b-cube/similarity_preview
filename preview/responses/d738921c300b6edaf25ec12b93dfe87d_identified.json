The program will also create a geographic information system (GIS) database for the parks under its management.  The purpose of the data is to document the state of vegetation within the NPS service area during the 1990's, thereby providing a baseline study for further analysis at the Regional or Service-wide level.  The vegetation units of this map were determined through stereoscopic interpretation of aerial photographs supported by field sampling and ecological analysis.  The vegetation boundaries were identified on the photographs by means of the photographic signatures and collateral information on slope, hydrology, geography, and vegetation in accordance with the Standardized National Vegetation Classification System (October 1995). The mapped vegetation reflects conditions that existed during the specific year and season that the aerial photographs were taken (spring - 1996 and fall - 1994). There is an inherent margin of error in the use of aerial photography for vegetation delineation and classification. </abstract>       <purpose> The purpose of this spatial data is to provide the National Park Service the necessary tools to wisely manage the natural resources within this park system.  Several parks, representing different regions, environmental conditions, and vegetation types, were chosen by BRD to be part of the prototype phase of the program.  The initial goal of the prototype phase is to \"develop, test, refine, and finalize the standards and protocols\" to be used during the production phase of the project.  This includes the development of a standardized vegetation classification system for each park and the establishment of photointerpretation, field, and accuracy assessment procedures. Isle Royale National Park was initially identified as one of the prototypes within the National Park System for the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. Isle Royale National Park was established March 3, 1931 and was also designated as an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980. The park contains approximately 571,790 acres of land and water (893 square miles) of which 133,782 acres is land and the rest is open water of Lake Superior as well as inland lakes and ponds. Isle Royale National Park is an archipelago of islands located in the northwestern region of Lake Superior close to the United States-Canada border.  The main island, Isle Royale, consists of a series of ridges and valleys running the length of the island and is surrounded by approximately 200 smaller islands.  The primary methods of transportation on the island are hiking and boating. </purpose>       <supplinf> Isle Royale National Park was authorized on March 3, 1931; it was formally established in 1940, and officially dedicated in 1946.  Most of the park's land area (98%) was designated as a Wilderness area in October 1976, and later additions increased the total Wilderness to 99% of the park. The park was designated an International Biosphere Reserve in 1980. </supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <mdattim>           <sngdate>             <caldate>19940826</caldate>           </sngdate>           <sngdate>             <caldate>19960425</caldate>           </sngdate>         </mdattim>       </timeinfo>       <current>ground condition / date of photo acquisition</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>None Planned</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <descgeog> Isle Royale National Park is an archipelago of islands located in the northwestern region of Lake Superior close to the United States-Canada border.

These commands produced listings that aided in identifying abnormal codes.  The errors were checked against the vegetation delineation and attribute overlays.  Corrections were made to the listings and input into the database.   ESRI produced a plot of the converted spatial data and sequence numbers (label I.D.s) for the manuscript. The plot was checked by AIS for cartographic quality of the arcs defining the polygon features and the accuracy of the label I.D. assignments. The plot was overlaid to the manuscript map to verify that the scanned data was not distorted beyond .02 map inches.  Other problems were noted on the plots, such as overshoots and undershoots, missing lines, premature convergence of polygon boundary lines that intersected arcs at acute angles, and incorrect sequence number assignments. ESRI produced code verification plots of the community association codes, height and density codes, and land use code attributes.  The plots were checked for coding errors that may have occurred during the polygon attribute encoding step.  The plots were overlaid on the manuscript map with attached corresponding code attribute overlay created in the manual rectification step. Code changes were noted on the plot.  The edited plots were delivered back to ESRI for correction of the attribute files.   Processors conducted interactive ARCEDIT sessions to make the necessary corrections to the coverages. </attraccr>     </attracc>     <logic> All polygon features are checked for topology using the ARC/INFO software.  Each polygon begins and ends at the same point with the node feature. All nodes are checked for error so that there are no dangling features.  There are no duplicate lines or polygons.  All nodes will snap together and close polygons based on a specific tolerance. If the node is not within the tolerance, it is adjusted manually.  The test for logical consistency are performed in ARC/INFO. </logic>     <complete> All data that can be photointerpreted is also digitized.

The field reconnaissance visit serves two major functions.  First, the photointerpreter keys the signature on the aerial photos to the vegetation on the ground at each signature site. Second, the photointerpreter becomes familiar with the flora, vegetation communities and local ecology that occur in the study area. Park and/or TNC field biologists that are familiar with the local vegetation and ecology of the park are present to help the photointerpreter understand these elements and their relationship with the geography of the park.  Upon completion of the field reconnaissance, photo interpreters delineate vegetation units on mylar sheets that overlay the 9\"x9\" aerial photographs. This effort is conducted in accordance with the TNC vegetation classification and criteria for defining each community or alliance. The initial mapping is then followed by a field verification session, designed to confirm that the vegetation units were mapped correctly. Any photointerpretation related questions are also addressed during the visit.  The vegetation mapping at Isle Royale National Park did not follow the normal mapping procedure as outlined above. Because of logistical limitations (short field season, overall general inaccessibility and difficulty in reaching a large number of photo signatures within a relatively short period of time), field verification was not conducted on the island. In lieu of field verification, a TNC ecologist would meet with the photointerpreters at AIS to review the delineations and PI signature calls as they relate to the preliminary classification. (See page 13 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd TNC/AIS Classification Crosswalk Meeting). The photointerpreters would also provide the ecologist with photo overlays identifying polygons with PI questions and polygons for verification that the ecologist could answer in the field while conducting the classification field sampling.  The Complete Process ran from 199606 to 200006.

The upper levels of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international standards developed by the United Nations Educational Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the hierarchy are based on the species composition of the existing vegetation (floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were originally developed by European ecologists.  The vegetation classification is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the USGS-NPS mapping efforts.
