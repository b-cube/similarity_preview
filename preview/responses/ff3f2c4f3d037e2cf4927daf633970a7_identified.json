The raster data file for the bathymetry map is included in \"Bathymetry_OffshoreCoalOilPoint.zip.\" The raster data file for the shaded-relief map is included in \"BathymetryHS_OffshoreCoalOilPoint.zip.\" Both are accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreCoalOilPoint/data_catalog_OffshoreCoalOilPoint.html. The bathymetry and shaded-relief maps of the Offshore of Coal Oil Point map area, California, were generated from bathymetry data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), by California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab (CSUMB), and by Fugro Pelagos. Most of the nearshore and shelf areas were mapped by the USGS in the summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008, using a combination of 117-kHz and 234.5-kHz SEA (AP) Ltd. SWATHplus-M phase-differencing sidescan sonars. A small area in the far-eastern nearshore and shelf was mapped by CSUMB in the summer of 2007, using a 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounder. The outer shelf and slope were mapped by Fugro Pelagos in 2008, using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125, 240-kHz Reson 8101, and 100-kHz Reson 8111 multibeam echosounders. The nearshore bathymetry and coastal topography were also mapped by Fugro Pelagos in 2009 for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Joint Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise, using the SHOALS-1000T bathymetric-lidar and the Leica ALS60 topographic-lidar systems. All of these mapping missions combined to collect bathymetry from the 0-m isobath to beyond the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. NOTE: the horizontal datum of the bathymtry data (NAD83) differs from the horizontal datum of other layers in this SIM (WGS84). Some bathymetry grids within this map were projected horizontally from WGS84 to NAD83 using ESRI tools to be more consistent with the vertical reference of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). </abstract> <purpose>These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public.

To account for tidal-cycle fluctuations, CSUMB used NavCom 2050 GPS receiver (CNAV) data, and Fugro Pelagos used KGPS data (GPS data with real-time kinematic corrections). In addition, sound-velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems (AM) SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the CNAV receiver and the KGPS data. Most soundings were converted to 2-m-resolution bathymetric-surface-model grids; however, soundings along the outer shelf and slope in water depths greater than 80 m were converted to a 5-m-resolution bathymetric-surface-model grid because of lower sounding density. Final 2007 XYZ soundings and bathymetric-surface models were referenced to the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984) relative to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 1988); the 2008 soundings were referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 1983) relative to NAVD 1988. During the USGS mapping missions, differential GPS (DGPS) data (2006, 2007) and GPS data with real-time kinematic corrections (2008) were combined with measurements of vessel motion (heave, pitch, and roll) in a CodaOctopus F180 attitude-and-position system to produce a high-precision vessel-attitude packet. This packet was transmitted to the acquisition software in real time and combined with instantaneous sound-velocity measurements at the transducer head before each ping. The returned samples were projected to the seafloor using a ray-tracing algorithm that works with previously measured sound-velocity profiles. Statistical filters were applied to discriminate seafloor returns (soundings) from unintended targets in the water column. The original 2006 and 2007 soundings were referenced to the WGS 1984 relative to the MLLW (Mean Lower Low Water) tidal datum, but, through postprocessing using NOAA's VDatum tool, the soundings were transformed to NAVD 1988. The original 2008 soundings were referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 1983), relative to NAVD 1988. Finally, the soundings were converted into 2-m-resolution bathymetric-surface-model grids. During the Fugro Pelagos coastal airborne-lidar mapping mission that was completed as part of the National Coastal Mapping Program of USACE, the Leica ALS60 topographic-lidar and the SHOALS-1000T bathymetric-lidar systems were mounted on an aircraft that flew survey lines at an altitude of 300 to 400 m (bathymetry) and 300 to 1,200 m (topography), at speeds of between 135 and 185 knots. The ALS60 system collected data at a maximum pulse rate of 200 kHz, and the SHOALS system collected data at 1 kHz. Information on aircraft position, velocity, and acceleration were collected using the Novatel and POS A/V 410 systems (SHOALS) and the onboard GPS/IMU system (ALS60). Aircraft-position data were processed using POSPac software, and the results were combined with the lidar data to produce 3-D positions for each lidar shot. Various commercial and proprietary software packages were used to clean the data, to convert all valid data from ellipsoid to orthometric heights, and to export the data as a series of topography and bathymetry ASCII files. Final grids were provided in geographic coordinates referenced to the NAVD 1988.</procdesc> <procdate>2009</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Pete Dartnell</cntper> <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>Physical Scientist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address>400 Natural Bridges Dr.</address> <city>Santa Cruz</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>95060-5792</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(831) 460-7415</cntvoice> <cntemail>pdartnell@usgs.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </proccont> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab and Fugro Pelagos 2-m and 5-m-resolution bathymetry data within this map were downloaded from http://seafloor.csumb.edu/SFMLwebDATA.htm.
