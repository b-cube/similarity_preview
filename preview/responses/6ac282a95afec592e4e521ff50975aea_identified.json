This includes maintaining a statewide database, the Response and Surveillance System for Childhood Lead Exposures (RASSCLE II) with blood lead levels and other demographic information about children who have been screened (blood lead tested).  &#13; &#13; In instances where laboratory results had a detection threshold of 5.0 micrograms per deciliter (\\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL) and blood measurements were reported at below this level, the result was counted as &lt;4.5 \\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL. Duplicate children, duplicate blood tests, identified false positive tests, and tests known to be clerical errors have been excluded.&#13; &#13; CEHTP obtained blood lead level data from CLPPB and created this dataset to be used for public health surveillance.  The dataset on the CEHTP portal includes counts and percentages of blood lead levels of children tested by county and age (0-&lt;6, 6-&lt;21, and 0-&lt;21). Children are unique per year, only their highest blood lead level is reported. Percentages were calculated by CLPPB by using the total number of children tested in the denominator.&#13;  &#13; </procdesc> <procdate>20100403</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Housing information and poverty status about the U.S. population are collected by the U.S. government via the U.S. census every 10 years.  CEHTP downloaded the 2000 age of housing and poverty status data from the Census.gov website and aggregated the data into categories: housing built before 1950, housing built between 1950 and 1979, and housing built before 1979.</procdesc> <procdate>20100901</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>This data contains the following fields:&#13; Cnty_FIPS Start_Date End_Date Measure_ID Measure_VA&#13; &#13; </eaover> <eadetcit>Age categories are: 0-&lt;6, 6-&lt;21, and 0-&lt;21&#13; &#13; Blood lead level categories are:&#13; 0 to &lt;4.5 micrograms per deciliter (\\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL), 4.5 to &lt;9.5 \\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL, &gt;=9.5 \\ufffd\\ufffdg/dL</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>CEHTP Science Team</cntper> <cntorg>CA Department of Public Health, CA Environmental Health Tracking Program</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos/> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing</addrtype> <address>850 Marina Bay Parkway, Bldg P, 3rd Floor</address> <city>Richmond</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>94804</postal> <country>United States Of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>5106203620</cntvoice> <cnttdd/> <cntfax>5106203720</cntfax> <cntemail>data@cehtp.org</cntemail> <hours/> <cntinst/> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc>NA</resdesc> <distliab>Persons or entities given access to restricted data are liable for compliance with conditions set forth in the data use agreement.
