E. Betjeman and was educated at Marlborough College before going up to Magdalen College, Oxford in 1925. He married Penelope Valentine Hester (ne Chetwode) in 1933, and the couple had one son and a daughter. He began publishing poetry and pieces on topography and architecture, subjects which continued to occupy him throughout his life, in the Twenties and obtained a job at <title render=\"italic\" linktype=\"simple\">The Architectural Review</title> in 1930. Betjeman succeeded Cecil Day Lewis as Poet Laureate in 1972, and he was to hold the position until his death. He has been described as a 'national monument', the most popular poet Laureate of the twentieth-century. Certainly his poetry, including a verse autobiography <title render=\"italic\" linktype=\"simple\">Summoned by Bells</title> (1960), reached a wide audience, and he raised the public profile of architectural history, particularly that of English Parish Churches, through his published writings and his popular television broadcasts on this topic.</p>  <p>Betjeman accompanied his family on holidays in Trebetherick, North Cornwall, as a boy and he retained a life-long affection for and association with the region which is reflected in his publications, including <title render=\"italic\" linktype=\"simple\">Victorian and Edwardian Cornwall from Old Photographs</title>, compiled by John Betjeman and A.L. Rowse (1976) and <title render=\"italic\" linktype=\"simple\">Betjeman's Cornwall</title> (1984).</p>  <p>An immensely well-known and well-loved public figure, Betjeman was friends with a great many poets and writers of his day, including the novelist Kingsley Amis, the writer and critic Cyril Connolly, the cricket commentator John Arlott, and the Sitwell family, as well as many younger writers, including the man who was to succeed him as Poet Laureate, Ted Hughes. Betjeman's working library includes many books gifted and inscribed to Betjeman by these, and other prominent literary and public figures of the twentieth-century. He was knighted in 1969, awarded a CBE in 1960, and a CLitt in 1968.    </p>  </bioghist>  <scopecontent>  <p>  This small collection contains manuscripts of stray archival materials found loose within the working library collection. Included are: letters and cards (from Betjeman himself, and also to Betjeman from family, friends, literary and other acquaintances including aspiring poets, publishers and fans); draft articles and reviews, drawings; notes; and manuscript poem drafts/fragments (mostly unpublished), the majority of which have been partially (because of the illegibility of his handwriting!) transcribed and listed. Also included are original and copy typescripts and manuscripts of unpublished works (mainly literary, but also including some photograph albums) by friends and acquaintances of Betjeman, many of them signed by the author - these are fully transcribed.</p>  <p>Many of the books in the library have also been heavily annotated by Betjeman (with jottings, rough notes, poem fragments etc.), and these inscriptions have also been partially listed and transcribed.    </p>  </scopecontent>  <custodhist>  <p>The working library of Betjeman has been held at the University of Exeter Library (Special Collections) since 1997: EUL MS 117 contains manuscripts of stray archival materials found loose within the working library collection.</p>  </custodhist>  <accessrestrict>  <p>Usual EUL arrangements apply.</p>  </accessrestrict>  <userestrict>  <p>Usual EUL restrictions apply.</p>  </userestrict>  <note>  <p>The majority of loose items found contained within the Library have been retained within book on which they were originally found.
