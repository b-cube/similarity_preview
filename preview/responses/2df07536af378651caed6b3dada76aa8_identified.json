Brown from Miami, took place in the Gulf of Mexico and then along the East US coast to Boston. The effort was in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP). The cruise was designed to obtain a snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm. This was the second occupation, with the first occurring in 2007, and complemented mooring time series and other regional OA activities. The cruise included a series of 8 transects approximately orthogonal to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts and a comprehensive set of underway measurements along the entire transect.</abstract>     <purpose>To measure key carbon, physical and biogeochemical parameters in coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico and eastern coast of the US in relation to Ocean Acidification.</purpose>     <startdate>2012-07-21</startdate>    <enddate>2012-08-13</enddate>     <westbd>-90.344</westbd>    <eastbd>-68.5931</eastbd>    <northbd>42.1139</northbd>    <southbd>24.3784</southbd>     <spatialReference></spatialReference>     <geographicName>U.S. East Coast</geographicName>    <geographicName>Gulf of Mexico</geographicName>      <fundingAgency>       <agency>NOAA Ocean Acidification Program</agency>       <title>Coastal Observations on the East Coast: Ocean Acidification Monitoring Network</title>       <ID>OAPFY13.03.AOML.001</ID>    </fundingAgency>     <researchProject></researchProject>     <Platform>       <PlatformName>RV Ronald H.

DICE was developed by Esa Peltola and Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana Greeley of  NOAA/PMEL to modernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA (Johnson et al. 1985, 1987, 1993, and 1999; Johnson 1992)</analyzingInstrument>       <detailedInfo>Samples for total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the Handbook of Methods for CO2 Analysis (DOE 1994) from Niskin bottles into cleaned 294-ml glass bottles. Bottles were rinsed and filled from the bottom, leaving 6 ml of headspace; care was taken not to entrain any bubbles. After 0.2 ml of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative, the sample bottles were sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease and were stored at room temperature for a maximum of 12 hours prior to analysis. The DIC analytical equipment was set up in a seagoing laboratory van. The analysis was done by coulometry with two analytical systems (AOML3 and AOML4) used simultaneously on the cruise. In the coulometric analysis of DIC, all carbonate species are converted to CO2 (gas) by addition of excess hydrogen ion (acid) to the seawater sample, and the evolved CO2 gas is swept into the titration cell of the coulometer with pure air or compressed nitrogen, where it reacts quantitatively with a proprietary reagent based on ethanolamine to generate hydrogen ions. In this process, the solution changes from blue to colorless, triggering a current through the cell and causing coulometrical generation of OH minus ions at the anode. The OH ions react with the H+, and the solution turns blue again. A beam of light is shone through the solution, and a photometric detector at the opposite side of the cell senses the change in transmission. Once the percent transmission reaches its original value, the coulometric titration is stopped, and the amount of CO2 that enters the cell is determined by integrating the total charge during the titration. The pipette volume was determined by taking aliquots at known temperature of distilled water from the volumes. The weights with the appropriate densities were used to determine the volume of the pipettes.  Calculation of the amount of CO2 injected was according to the CO2 handbook (DOE 1994).  The instrument has a salinity sensor, but all DIC values were recalculated to a molar weight (micro-mol/kg) using density obtained from the CTD salinity. The DIC values were corrected for dilution by 0.2 ml of saturated HgCl2 used for sample preservation.  A correction was also applied for the offset from the CRM. This additive correction was applied for each cell using the CRM value obtained in the beginning of the cell. The average correction was 2.3 micro-mol/kg.   While both systems worked very well during the cruise, they occasionally had high blanks.  Normally the blank is less than 30, but we were forced to run them with blanks in the 12 to 45 range.  Other problems were relatively minor. The Midas failed shortly after the cruise began so compressed Nitrogen was used for sample analysis. Communication errors between the instruments and their controlling laptop computers occurred several times. Coulometer AOML 5 was replaced with Coulometer AOML 3 on DICE 3 the second to last day during the GOM line of stations. Underway samples were collected from the flow thru system in the Wet Lab during transits between station lines.  Discrete DIC samples were collected every two hours with duplicates every fourth sample.    </detailedInfo>       <replicate>Duplicates were collected on every station as well as on the underway discrete sampling</replicate>       <standard>          <description>The coulometers were calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.99%) by means of an 8-port valve outfitted with two sample loops with known gas volumes bracketing the amount of CO2 extracted from the water samples for the two AOML systems.</description>          <frequency> The stability of each coulometer cell solution was confirmed three different ways: two sets of gas loops were measured at the beginning; also the Certified Reference Material (CRM), Batches 112 and 120, supplied by Dr. A.

The coulometer cell solution was replaced after 25 mg of carbon was titrated, typically after 9 to 12 hours of continuous use.</frequency>          <crm>             <manufacturer>Dr. A.

Seawater samples were collected from the Niskin bottles directly in 10-cm cylindrical optical cells (~30 mL volume) using a section of silicone tubing (about 15 cm long). One end of the silicone tubing was attached to the optical cell and the other end was attached to the nipple of the Niskin bottle. The Niskin bottle nipple was pushed in to initiate flow and the silicone tubing was squeezed to eliminate air bubbles. The optical cell was agitated to eliminate bubbles and, after 15 seconds of sample flow, the cell was capped at one end. The silicone tubing was then detached from the optical cell and, with the water still flowing, the cap was rinsed and used to seal the optical cell. Samples collected this way were not exposed to the atmosphere, and each cell was flushed with approximately three cell volumes of seawater. The samples were collected, taken into the lab, and rinsed with tap water to get rid of salt outside of the cells. The cells were dried and the optical windows were cleaned with Kimwipes. Samples were thermostatted at 25 (minus plus 0.05) degrees Celsius in a custom made 36-position cell warmer. A custom macro program running on Agilent ChemStation was used to guide the measurements and data processing. The macro automated the procedures of sample input, blank and sample scans, quality control, and data archiving. The quality control steps included checking the baseline shift after dye injection and monitoring the standard deviation of multiple scans. Absorbance blanks were taken for each sample and 10 micro liter of purified m-cresol purple (10 mmol kg-1) were added for the analysis. pHT (total scale) was calculated according to Liu et al.

Bottles were rinsed twice, the second time while inverted. They were filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume while taking care not to entrain any bubbles. About 5 ml of water was withdrawn to allow for expansion of the water as it warms and to provide space for the stopper and tubing of the analytical system.  Saturated mercuric chloride solution (0.2 ml) was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease and were stored at room temperature for a maximum of twelve hours prior to analysis.The analyses for pCO2 were done with the discrete samples at 20 degrees Celsius. A primary water bath was kept within 0.03 degrees Celsius of the analytical temperature; a secondary bath was kept within 0.15 degrees Celsius the analytical temperature. The majority of the samples were analyzed in batches of twelve bottles, which with standards took approximately 2.5 hours.

Prior to sample collection, inserts were inspected for proper fit and loose inserts replaced to insure an airtight seal. Laboratory temperature was also monitored electronically throughout the cruise. PSS-78 salinity UNES81, was calculated for each sample from the measured conductivity ratios. The offset between the initial standard seawater value and its reference value was applied to each sample. The difference (if any) between the initial and final vials of standard seawater was then applied to each sample as a linear function of elapsed run time.  Salinity analyses were performed after samples had equilibrated to laboratory temperature, usually at least 24 hours after collection. The salinometer was standardized for each group of samples analyzed (usually 2 casts and up to 50 samples) using two bottles of standard seawater: one at the beginning and end of each set of measurements. The salinometer output was logged to a computer file. The software prompted the analyst to flush the instrument cell and change samples when appropriate.

Both sensors tracked each other very well, with no noted problems. The DO sensors were calibrated to dissolved O2 check samples by matching the up cast bottle trips to down cast CTD data along isopycnal surfaces, calculating CTD dissolved O2, and then minimizing the residuals using a non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. The fitting determined calibration coefficients for the sensor model conversion equation and proceeded in a series of steps. Each sensor was fit in a separate sequence. The first step was to determine the time constants for the exponential terms in the model. These time constants are sensor-specific but applicable to an entire cruise. Once the time constants had been determined, casts were fit individually to O2 check sample data. The resulting calibration coefficients were then smoothed and held constant during a refit to determine sensor slope and offset. Calibration accuracy was examined by comparing O1-O2 over a range of station numbers and pressures (bottle trip locations) for each cast. For the entire cruise, only one set of oxygen sensors were used, both tracked each other extremely nicely.

Bottles were rinsed three times and filled from the bottom, overflowing three volumes while taking care not to entrain any bubbles. The draw temperature was taken using a digital thermometer with a flexible thermistor probe that was inserted into the flask while the sample was being drawn during the overflow period. These temperatures were used to calculate concentrations, and a diagnostic check of Niskin bottle integrity. One ml of MnCl2 and one ml of NaOH/NaI were added immediately after drawing of the sample was concluded using a Repipetor, the flasks were then stoppered and shaken well. DIW was added to the neck of each flask to create a water seal. The flasks were stored in the lab in plastic totes at room temperature for at least 1 hour before analysis. Twenty-four samples plus duplicates were drawn from each station except the shallow coastal stations where fewer samples were drawn depending on the depth or as directed by the chief scientist.  Dissolved oxygen analyses were performed with an automated oxygen titrator using amperometric end-point detection (Langdon 2010). The titration of the samples and the data logging and graphical display was performed on a PC running a LabView program written by Ulises Rivero of AOML. The titrations were performed in a climate controlled lab at 18.5-20 degrees Celsius. Thiosulfate was dispensed by a 2 ml Gilmont syringe driven with a stepper motor controlled by the titrator. Tests in the lab were performed to confirm that the precision and accuracy of the volume dispensed were comparable or superior to the Dosimat 665. The whole-bottle titration technique of Carpenter (1965) with modifications by Culberson et al. (1991) was used.  Four to three replicate 10 ml iodate standards were run 13 times during the cruise. The reagent blank was determined at the beginning and end of the cruise. A titration was made to 1 ml of iodate standard. The volume of thiosulfate required for the titration is V1. An additional 1 ml of standard was added to the titrated sample and titrated again. The volume of thiosulfate used for the second titration is V2. The reagent blank was determined as the difference between V1 and V2.    </detailedInfo>       <replicate> Over 100 duplicate samples were drawn.

A series of at least three spectra were averaged for each determination and samples were rerun if the overall standard deviations were higher than 0.0004 for pH measurements and 0.002 for carbonate ion measurements. This process was repeated until the standard deviation of multiple readings was within 0.0004 for pH and 0.002 for carbonate. Absorbance values were saved so that the quality criteria can be evaluated in the future. Data for directly measured carbonate are reported in terms of both concentrations and the R-Ratios taken at 250 nm and 234 nm.
