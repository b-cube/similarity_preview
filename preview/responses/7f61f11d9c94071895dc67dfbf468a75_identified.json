The list was compiled from literature sources, museum collection databases, and surveys conducted in 2000-2008 by the NOAA Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center's Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED). A total of 506 shore-fish species and 27 epipelagic species were recorded from the five islands. Of the shore-fish species, 41 (8.1%) were first noted in our CRED surveys. Numbers for the individual islands are: Howland Island-328 species of which 166 (50.8%) are first records from CRED sampling; Baker Island-268 species with 188 (70.1%) as new CRED records; Jarvis Island-274 species with 176 (64.2%) as new CRED records; Palmyra Atoll-395 species with 113 (28.6%) as new CRED records; and Kingman Reef-270 species with 212 (78.5%) as new CRED records. Fifteen additional species whose identifications are in need of verification were reported in our surveys or previous efforts. An additional 16 are considered suspect identifications of species that probably do not occur at the Line or Phoenix Islands. Differences in the species composition of the five islands are discussed in the context of habitat diversity, historic sampling effort, and regional oceanography. The evolution of shore-fish species found at these central Pacific islands is reviewed in the context of phylogeographic information, geology of Pacific islands, and regional oceanography. It is argued that oceanography and dispersal have played a larger role than geologic adjacencies in the evolution of central Pacific oceanic island fishes. Knowledge of the fish fauna of the central equatorial Pacific remains incomplete, in part, because of limited sampling of small, nocturnal, or otherwise cryptic species. These five islands are unique among United States possessions in having a few reef fish species found nowhere else in the country. The isolated islands of the central Pacific remain one of the most poorly understood regions on earth for knowledge of biodiversity.\" </Abstract>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20110223000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00585.pdf </URL>  <Region>PRIA </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-159.385349 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>163.070637 </Westbc>  <Southbc>-0.980462 </Southbc>  <Northbc>19.40 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>article </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>article </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
