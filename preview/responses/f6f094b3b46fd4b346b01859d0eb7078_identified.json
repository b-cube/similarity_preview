Better understanding of this phenomenon was deemed very important by the assessment review panel. The vermilion snapper assessments conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic have experienced difficulties contending with extremely high variances in size-at-age. The primary goal of this work is to collect life history information on red grouper and vermilion snapper. The project will focus on collecting reproductive samples from red grouper and age samples from vermilion snapper. The samples will be taken from the central and southwestern shelf of west Florida, which will complement samples from other areas. Information on habitat will be collected to compare possible differences in life history parameters among different habitat types. The project will conduct 14 eight-day trips over 18 mo to collect gonads and otoliths from red grouper and vermilion snapper. Samples, including length and weight of individual fish, will be collected according to NMFS protocol and delivered to NMFS for analyses. Specific sites will be sampled to allow NMFS scientists to identify potential differences between growth and reproductive rates among the selected sites.  </dcterms:abstract>    <dc:publisher>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</dc:publisher>    <dc:creator>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</dc:creator>    <dc:identifier xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/20405</dc:identifier>    <dcterms:isPartOf xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                 https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/9386</dcterms:isPartOf>    <dcterms:references xsi:type=\"dcterms:URI\">                         https://inport.nmfs.noaa.gov/inport/item/21521</dcterms:references>    <dcterms:temporal xsi:type=\"dcterms:Period\">                             start=2006-01-01;                             end=2007-07-31;                         </dcterms:temporal>    <dcterms:accessRights>The project data is not available for online viewing or downloading.</dcterms:accessRights>    <dc:format>disc</dc:format> </metadata> ",
