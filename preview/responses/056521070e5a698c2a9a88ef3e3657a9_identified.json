In policy terms, there has been a growing emphasis on children's rights and the importance and understanding of children's perspectives on their own lives. Consequently, children can no longer be perceived as forgotten victims where domestic violence is concerned. This paper explores practitioners' awareness of the needs of children and young people living with, and fleeing from, domestic violence. The research, conducted in a rural area in Wales, reveals that although the views of practitioners reflect the concerns reported by young people in other studies, there can be barriers to meeting these needs. While policy prescribes engaging with children, at the institutional level, operational priorities and increasing administrative demands can actually reduce opportunities for working directly with children. These demands may hamper the development of multi-agency practice. </summary> <dc:date>2013-03-21T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>\\ufffd\\ufffdAmenazas para la seguridad o amenazas para los individuos?

Fard, Shahrad Nasrolahi Summary&#13; The absence of a powerful uniform legal authority, to enforce international law and international agreements, has placed reciprocity in a pivotal position in inter-State relations and the extent to which States rely on reciprocity. This thesis examines the significance of reciprocity and the extent to which reciprocity manifests itself in international law, more specifically is this manifestation a foundation of international law or whether international law creates reciprocity. The present work argues how reciprocity in international law is a multifaceted concept. On the one side it is a principal tool incentivising States away from wrongful acts, and to abide by their obligations; alternatively it is a tool for establishing the right to a reciprocal response. Thus the study sets out to explore how international law shapes the international community\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds interactions and how, in turn, these interactions shape international law.&#13; Considering the important role that the rule of law plays in the context of international law, the thesis aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the rule of law particularly in its relationship with international law. This analysis will provide a useful discussion on the interactions between the rule of law and reciprocity.&#13; The United Nations was established to enhance co-operation amongst the international community with the goal of maintaining international peace and security. This thesis will explore the role of reciprocity in international law on enhancing international commitment and international co-operation. The significance of this lies in reciprocal and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdremedial\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd options in international law that maintain States\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd commitment to international obligations which in turn develops friendly relations and international co-operation.&#13; This thesis will aim to contribute to scholarly works to bridge the existing gap in interdisciplinary studies exploring the connection between reciprocity, co-operation and the rule of law in the realm of international law. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Ruling Law: Parliamentary Sovereignty and Judicial Activism</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13781\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Graddon, Thomas</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13781</id> <updated>2014-10-23T03:08:04Z</updated> <published>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Ruling Law: Parliamentary Sovereignty and Judicial Activism Graddon, Thomas At the end of the Twentieth Century, as the theory of legalism in the common law lost its grip, it had been suggested that the idea of Parliamentary Sovereignty was an outdated model for British constitutionality, and that the practice of Judicial Activism should be permitted to expand. Based upon this premise, this thesis proposes that the Courts should adopt the legal title of Sovereign, based on evidence of their actively both making and overturning laws and statutes in the United Kingdom.&#13; Based on accounts gathered from case law from both the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions, and interviews with Judges of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, it shall be shown that Parliament\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds relationship with the courts has changed radically since Parliamentary sovereignty was first popularised, and that in the United Kingdom Parliament is subject to the will of the judiciary, and not the other way around.&#13; However, this thesis will also demonstrate that this system is not without its own flaws. Examples of judicial corruption, widely criticised decisions and a lack of democratic transparency in jurisdictions can be found across the world; all tarnish judicial sovereignty as a viable alternative to that of Parliament, and erode the public\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds trust in the Courts to protect and defend the ideals of justice and the Rule of Law. Without these principles, the courts become a black-robed agency of the Government or worse, a publicly funded old-boys network that principally protects its own interests and its grip on authority.&#13; Though the ideals that the courts claim to uphold are virtuous, history has shown the worrying consequences of Judicial complacency as Governments ignore the rule of law and the concept of Justice, most prominently observed in the dictatorships of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. If Judicial Sovereignty is to survive, it must learn from, and overcome, the mistakes of the past, and harmonise their role as appointed public figures with ideas of popular democratic government. To do this, it must accept Parliament\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds rule-making capacity, but doing this in a way that preserves their Legal Sovereignty is the central challenge the Judiciary must face. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
