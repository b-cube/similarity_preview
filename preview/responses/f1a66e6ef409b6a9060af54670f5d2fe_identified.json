The water samples were brought into the lab and analyzed for salinity, chlorophyll a, nitrogen (total whole and dissolved, ammonia, and nitrate-nitrite), phosphorus (total and dissolved and ortho phosphate), dissolved organic carbon, suspended sediment (total suspended sediment, inorganic suspended sediment, organic suspended sediment), and suspended sediment color.  Tide stage based on published NOAA tide charts for each sample were also included in the database.  Samples were simultaneously collected from three of the four sample sites.  Three sites are located in salt marsh tidal creeks found in the North Inlet Estuary.  These samples are taken at the end of Oyster Landing dock (OL) in Crab Haul Creek, the upper reaches of Debidue Creek (DC) near the boundary between Hobcaw Barony and the Debordieu Colony, and Clambank Landing Dock (CB) in Clambank Creek.  The other site is located adjacent to the Winyah Bay Estuary.  The Thousand Acre (TA) samples are taken near the mouth of a small tidal creek that connects the Thousand Acre Rice Field to Winyah Bay.  For more information on the sample sites, see the Description of Geographic Extent Section.</abstract> <purpose>The NERR 20 day water chemistry (NERRWCHEM) database is essentially a continuation of the Long-Term Ecological Research Daily Water Sample 1978-1993 (LTERDWS) database whose purpose was to monitor nutrient cycling in the North Inlet Estuary, Georgetown, SC (see Cross Reference Section).  The NERR 20 day water chemistry program was initiated in June of 1993 to continue the monitoring of nutrients in the North Inlet Estuary systemand also to continue the long-term database on the nutrient concentration dynamics of the North Inlet salt marsh estuarine system.  Because the LTERDWS water sampling collections were taken every day at 10:00am EST, it was determined that the nutrient data are biased for Spring high tides; not all tides levels would be represented.  The new NERRWCHEM sampling protocols (based on a 10 day cycle) sample all tidal stages over the years.  A larger purpose of this monitoring program is to combine the water chemistry, chlorophyll a, and suspended sediment monitoring data with other existing North Inlet ecological monitoring data to provide ecosystem level information and understanding.</purpose> <supplinf> The protocols for the analysis of water samples for NERRWCHEM and LTERDWS are identical.  The sampling strategy is the only difference between the two databases.  The DWS data were gathered by submerging a one liter bottle into the surface waters at 10:00 am on a daily basis by a technician, while the NERR samples are collected every 2 hours and 4 minutes for a 26-hour period every 20 days, by an autosampler.  The LTERDWS data contains a few additional water parameters and records tide elevations from an actual tide staff or water level readings, as opposed to assigning a level based on tide charts. Oyster Landing, Debidue Creek, and Clambank are the monitoring sites utilized in both databases; the LTERDWS database also included Town Creek and the NERRWCHEM database includes Thousand Acre. In 1992, a study was conducted to compare the water chemistry results obtained from the LTER DWS sampling protocol and the proposed NERRWCHEM protocol.  There were no significant differences observed between the two methods, except for an increase in sediment load found in the autosampler samples.  (See the Ancillary Data portion of the documentation for more information.)  Additional comparisons of overlapping data (all parameters) from the two studies in June of 1993showed that the NERRWCHEM measurements were within the expected range based on LTER DWS data.  All available results and documentation for both of these comparison studies were archived on the NERRWCHEM 1993-2001 CD's and in the NERRWCHEM 1993-2001 Notebook as part of the 2003 Data Rescue Project. Tide Height or Stage: Sampling events always begin and end on predicted slack low tide (SL) and cover two tide cycles, one in the day and one at night.  The timing of SL for the North Inlet sites (DC, CB, OL) is different than the timing of SL for the Winyah Bay site (TA), due to the distances away from the ocean, runoff, and river flow.  Therefore, sample times for each site do not match exactly within a sample event, but tide stages or levels do.  Sample times were determined based on predicted tide elevations from NOAA tide charts for Charleston, SC.  A study was conducted to determine how much variation there was between North Inlet tides (at OL, DC, and CB) and the predicted times for Charleston.  It was determined that the North Inlet times were not different by more than 5 to 10 minutes.  Estimated times for the Winyah Bay site were attained by comparing the water quality data logger water level measurements between the North Inlet sites and Thousand Acre.  It was determined that slack low for the  TA site was one hour and 30 minutes later than the North Inlet sites.  However, there can be a great deal of variability in tide stage at all sites due to wind, rain, and river flow; TA site is the most variable.  Tides can be delayed anywhere from one to two hours from the predicted. Chlorophyll a: It was discovered that the fluorometer used to analyze samples for Chlorophyll a began to produce inaccurate readings in the fall of 1999.  The problem was not recognized until May of 2001, and by then, a large number of samples had been analyzed.  Samples are often analyzed only after several sample events have been collected.  Any effort to correct the data for degradation of the fluorometer's readings is therefore reliant on the date the sample was processed, not necessarily the date of collection.  Baruch technicians devised a method for correcting some of the data, but the Data Manager determined that, without documentation of the date the sample was processed, corrections could not be made with enough assurance of accuracy.  Therefore, data for the time period of 11/18/1999 through 4/22/2001 have been removed from the data set and replaced with missing data markers \".\".  Although the data immediately prior to 11/18/1999 appear \"normal\" and have been retained in the dataset, they should be used with caution.  Without documentation of sample processing dates, we cannot be sure that earlier data weren't also processed after the fluorometer began to fail.  Current protocol calls for the documentation of sample processing dates.  Users interested in obtaining the Chl a data that were removed should contact Baruch's Data Manager. </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19930602</begdate> <begtime>1220 EST</begtime> <enddate>20011218</enddate> <endtime>0354 EST</endtime> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Observed</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <descgeog> The North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located on the southeastern coast of the United States on the Atlantic Ocean in two tidal estuaries, North Inlet and Winyah Bay, near Georgetown, South Carolina.  The North Inlet estuary, located approximately 10 km east of Georgetown, is a bar-built Class C type estuary (Pritchard, 1955).  The North Inlet estuary is composed of numerous winding tidal creeks, and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts.  The watershed drains a 24.8 km2 area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential watershed to the north.  The Winyah Bay estuary, classified as a Class B type estuary by Pritchard (1955), which originates in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, is one of the largest river-estuary ecosystems on the Eastern Seaboard.  It is located 14.4 km south of the mouth of North Inlet Estuary.  Winyah Bay drains the sub-basins of 6 major rivers, which are heavily impacted by agriculture, mining, and industry.  The rivers drain approximately 46,736 km2 of uplands and marshes.  Descriptions of the individual monitoring sites are as follows: Clambank Creek (CB):  The Clambank Creek monitoring site is located roughly in the center of the NIW reserve.  The site is surrounded by a Spartina marsh and drains associated uplands.  Salinity ranges from 0 to 36.  The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash and some fine sediment.  This site is considered pristine and is influenced by its close proximity to the Inlet mouth. Debidue Creek (DC):  The Debidue Creek monitoring site is located in an ocean-dominated Spartina marsh that was formerly surrounded by pine-dominated uplands.  The site is approximately 1 km south of the Debordieu Colony, a large development built on man-made canals that drain into the northern portion of Debidue Creek, and as a result, may be considered an impacted site.  Salinity can range from 0 to 36 parts per thousand and average tidal flux is approximately 2 meters.  The creek has an average depth of 2.2 m MHW and an average width of 70 m MHW at the sample site.  The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus. Oyster Landing (OL):  The Oyster Landing monitoring site is considered a fairly pristine and undisturbed area.  Samples are collected at the end of the Oyster Landing pier from the floating dock, which is adjacent to the location of the NIW NERR weather station.  The pier stretches into the upper reaches of Crab Haul Creek in the mid-western portion of North Inlet and is approximately 2.8 km from the headwaters of Crab Haul Creek.  The creek drains pine forested uplands and wetlands.  Salinity can range from 0 to 36 parts per thousand and average tidal flux is approximately 1.4 m.  The creek has an average depth of ~2 m MHW and an average width of ~150m MHW at the sample site.  The bottom is mostly comprised of oyster shell hash with some fine sediment and detritus. Thousand Acre (TA):  The Thousand Acre monitoring site is located in Thousand Acre marsh tidal creek, near the creek mouth.  Prior to 7/19/1999, the sampling location was approximately 30 meters northeast of the west bridge of Thousand Acre marsh.  Because of heavy siltation near the creek bankwhich caused inaccurate water quality measurements at the original site, beginning on 7/19/1999, the sampling site was moved and samples were collected at the NW corner of the west bridge, about 15 m from the mouth of the creek.  At this new sampling site, creek depth is approximately 2 m MHW and creek width is approximately 10 m.  The creek empties into the northeastern side of the midportion of Winyah Bay and drains the Thousand Acre Rice Field and surrounding pine forested uplands and vegetated wetlands. Salinity ranges from 0 to 26 parts per thousand and tidal flux is approximately 1m.  The bottom is mostly composed of fine sediments and detritus.  Georgetown, the homeport for a number of heavy industries, including a steel plant, paper mill, chemical plant, and a coal fired plant. Most are located on the southern side of Winyah Bay, 5 km upstream from the Thousand Acre site.  A public sewage treatment plant, which discharges into the bay, is also located in Georgetown.

Triplicate standards are run at the beginning of each tray of samples and these must fall within a specified range for that particular chemistry.  Five blanks are prepared and analyzed to determine the level of contamination of the oxidizing reagent used in each batch of total nitrogen and total phosphorus samples.  These blanks are run in duplicate and the average value is used as a correction for that batch of total samples. Additional control measures are used with the Carbon Analyzer, the Fluorometer, and the Analytical Balance.  Samples analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the Shimadzu TOC-500 Carbon Analyzer are run in triplicate and means are reported.  Chlorophyll a values are determined by standard method of Fluorometric Analysis.  The fluorometer is calibrated by running standard curves (using chlorophyll a standard purchased from Sigma), which are then used to generate correction equations.  Concentration of the standard is confirmed by spectrophotometric analysis.  Finally, all recorded sediment weights are determined using a four-place Analytical Balance with a standard deviation of  (+/-) 0.1 mg. </attraccr> <qattracc> <attraccv> &gt;Time     &amp;plusmn; 5 minutes &gt;Total Nitrogen Whole (TNW)  &amp;plusmn; 1 micromole per liter* &gt;Total Nitrogen Filtered (TNF) &amp;plusmn; 1 micromole per liter* &gt;Total Phosphorus Whole (TPW) &amp;plusmn; 1 micromole per liter* &gt;Total Phosphorus Filtered (TPF) &amp;plusmn; 1 micromole per liter* &gt;Ortho phosphate (OP)  &amp;plusmn; 0.1 micromoles per liter* &gt;Ammonia (NH4)   &amp;plusmn; 0.1 micromoles per liter* &gt;Nitrate-Nitrite (NN)  &amp;plusmn; 0.1 micromoles per liter* &gt;Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) &amp;plusmn; 0.1 milligrams per liter &gt;Total Suspended Sediments (TSS) &amp;plusmn; 0.001 grams per liter (&amp;plusmn; 1 milligram per liter) &gt;Inorganic Suspended Sediments (ISS) &amp;plusmn; 0.001 grams per liter (&amp;plusmn; 1 milligram per liter) &gt;Organic Suspended Sediments (OSS) &amp;plusmn; 0.001 grams per liter (&amp;plusmn; 1 milligram per liter) &gt;Chlorophyll a (Chl a)  &amp;plusmn; 0.1 micrograms per liter (&amp;micro;g/l) &gt;Salinity    &amp;plusmn; 2 parts per thousand &gt;* [micromoles per liter = microgram atoms per liter] Parameter Number of Decimal Places &gt;TNW  1 &gt;TNF  1 &gt;TPW  1 &gt;TPF  1 &gt;OP  2 &gt;NH4  2 &gt;NN  2 &gt;DOC  1 &gt;TSS  1 &gt;ISS  1 &gt;OSS  1 &gt;CHLA  2 &gt;SAL  0 </attraccv> <attracce> Time:  The Eastern Standard Time that the sample was taken in hh:mm format.  Time is generally considered to be accurate to within plus or minus 5 minutes. TNW, TNF, TPW, and TPF:  The Technicon Autoanalyzer used for these analyses can read values to an accuracy of three decimal places.  However, due to error introduced through the handling of water samples, processing of samples, and the potential for variation and minor contamination of the oxidizing reagent, the actual accuracy is only plus or minus 1 micromole per liter.  As a result, the measurements (reported in micromoles per liter) are given with only one decimal place. OP, NH4, and NN:  The Technicon Autoanalyzer is also used for these analyses, but the handling and processing of these nutrients leaves less room for error and, as a result, the measurements are more accurate.  The measurements (reported in micromoles per liter) are given with two decimal places. DOC:  The Shimadzu Carbon analyzer reads to the nearest one hundredth, but because the final value is an average of three values, it is reported to the nearest tenth of a milligram/liter (one decimal place). TSS ISS OSS:  The balance used for these parameters reads to ten thousandths of a gram (four decimal places), but because humidity in the air can influence the weight of the filters, the measurements are only assumed accurate to one thousandth of a gram (3 decimal places), or one milligram.  The values are reported in the database to the nearest tenth of a milligram/liter (one decimal place). CHLA:  Strickland and Parsons (1977) say that chlorophyll a detection limits depend on the volume filtered and the sensitivity of the fluorometer.  Using a Turner fluorometer (presumably similar to the one in the NERR Water Chemistry project), their accuracy limit documentation states a limit of 0.01 micrograms/liter when 2 liters were filtered.  Because we filter 10-20 milliliters, the accuracy would be much less. We are estimating that our chlorophyll accuracy is 0.1 micrograms/liter at best.  No tests have been done to verify this.  Measurements are reported in micrograms/liter with two decimal places in the database. SAL:  The refractometer used to determine salinity reads to the nearest part per thousand; but is only accurate to within 2 parts per thousand.  The measurements are reported in parts per thousand with no decimal places in the database. TIDE EL:  Tide elevations were recorded for each sample based on NOAA tide charts for Charleston, SC's predicted tide times.  For the Winyah Bay site (TA) one hour and 30 minutes were added to this time to compensate for the lag in the tide between locations. Strickland, J.D.H., and T.R. Parsons. 1972.

These negative values are not generated by the Technicon Autoanalyzer.  Negative values are the result of mathematical manipulation of the raw values.  Very low values approaching the lower detection limit should be suspect and considered zero values.  The actual negative values should be viewed as an indicator of the range of error involved in the method for analysis. Negative values can occur for one or a combination of the following reasons: &gt;   1) The nutrient concentration of the sample approaches the minimum detection &gt;      limit of the technique - the assumption is that the baseline drift on the &gt;      technicon is both linear &amp; incremental &gt;   2) Errors were incurred during the preparation of the samples for analysis &gt;   3) Subtraction of the oxidation reagent blank from the very low total &gt;      nutrient concentration These values are reported as negative values in the final data set, they are not changed to zero. </logic> <complete> The MS Excel data file is verified for typographical errors by the Data Manager.

We recommend that these data be used with caution.  Any data determined to be erroneous have been removed from the dataset and are noted in this report. All chlorophyll a data for the following dates were determined to be erroneous and removed.  See the Supplemental Information section for more details. CHLA for all sites:  11/18/1999 - 4/22/2001 Clambank Creek: TPW (12.8) on 7/27/1994, event #22, sample #10, at 23:25 on a SH tide.  This value is very high for the parameter relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  The Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, and as a result, it is possible that the measurement is valid. CHLA on 7/27/1994 and 7/28/1994, event #22.  Chlorophyll data for this event are suspect as a result of the filter combination used with the fluorometer (see Process Description).  The Data Manager found these values to be fairly high, but the values for the following sampling period (on 8/16/1994) were even higher.  For this reason, the measurements were left in the data set, however, they should be used with caution. Debidue Creek: NH4 (11.9) on 2/20/2001, event #142, sample #1, at 12:17 pm a SL tide.  This value is very high for the parameter relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  All of the subsequent samples measured during this event were 0.0, except for #12, which had a value of 0.1.  Both this extreme change in readings and the consistent 0.0 measurements over a sample event are unusual.  The entire sample event is questionable, however, since the Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, it is possible that the measurements are valid. Oyster Landing: CHLA on 7/27/1994 and 7/28/1994, event #22.  Chlorophyll data for this event are suspect as a result of the filter combination used with the fluorometer (see Process Description).  The Data Manager found these values to be fairly high, but the values for the following sampling period (on 8/16/1994) were even higher.  For this reason, the measurements were left in the data set, however, they should be used with caution. NH4 (38.0) on 8/16/1994, event #23, sample #1, at 9:17 on a SL tide.  This value is very high for the parameter relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  The Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, and as a result, it is possible that the measurement is valid. NH4 (33.1) on 3/24/1995, event #34, sample #7, at 20:37 on a SL tide.  This value is very high for the parameter relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  The Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, and as a result, it is possible that the measurement is valid. TNW (199.9) on 9/4/1998, event #97, sample #1, at 11:58 on a SL tide.  This value is very high for the parameter relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  The Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, and as a result, it is possible that the measurement is valid. Thousand Acre: TNW (388.9), TSS (1033.3), ISS (857.3), and OSS (176.0) on 7/27/1994, event #22, sample #7, at 18:43 on a SL tide.  These values are all very high for the parameters relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  However, since they do all correspond and there was no evidence of typographical or laboratory error found by the Data Manager, it is possible that the measurements are valid. CHLA on 7/27/1994 and 7/28/1994, event #22.  Chlorophyll data for this event are suspect as a result of the filter combination used with the fluorometer (see Process Description).  The Data Manager found these values to be fairly high, but the values for the following sampling period (on 8/16/1994) were even higher.  For this reason, the measurements were left in the data set, however, they should be used with caution. TNW (329.4) on 8/17/1994, event #23, sample #13, at 11:35 on a SL tide.  This is a very high value for the parameter relative to the typical measurements at this site.  However, since the Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, it is possible that the measurement is valid. &gt;NN (69.9) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #1, at 8:30 on a SL tide. &gt;NN (58.7) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #2, at 10:34 on a FL tide. &gt;NN (70.3) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #3, at 12:38 on a FH tide. &gt;NN (69.1) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #4 at 14:42 on a SH tide. &gt;NN (66.5) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #5 at 16:46 on a EH tide. &gt;NN (51.2) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #6, at 18:50 on a EL tide. &gt;NN (61.3) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #9, at 1:02 on a FH tide. &gt;NN (66.4) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #10, at 3:06 on a SH tide. &gt;NN (64.0) on 10/4/1996, event #62, sample #11, at 5:10 on a EH tide. These values are all very high for the parameter relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  Nearly the entire sampling event registered abnormally high values for NN, with the exception of samples #7 and #8, which appeared \"normal\".  Samples #12 and #13 are missing from the data set completely for all parameters. The high values occurred over the full tide cycle; tide did not seem to have a major affect on the measurements.  The Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error; it is possible that the measurements are valid. TPW (26.9) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #3, at 15:00 on a FH tide.  This is a very high value for the parameter relative to the typical measurements at this site.  However, since the Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error, it is possible that the measurement is valid.  The TNW value for this sample is also high, although the difference from typical TNW measurements is less dramatic than the TPW.  See the following TSS, OSS, and ISS anomalous data information as well. &gt;TSS (64.0), ISS (45.7), and OSS (18.3) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #1, at &gt;     10:52 on a SL tide. &gt;TSS (39.5), ISS (27.5), and OSS (12.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #2, at &gt;     12:56 on a FL tide. &gt;TSS (586.7), ISS (470.7), and OSS (116.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #3, at &gt;     15:00 on a FH tide. &gt;TSS (268.0), ISS (56.0), and OSS (212.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #4, at &gt;     17:04 on a SH tide. &gt;TSS (252.0), ISS (246.7), and OSS (5.3) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #5, at &gt;     19:08 on a EH tide. &gt;TSS (99.0), ISS (114.0), and OSS (-15.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #6, at &gt;     21:12 on a EL tide. &gt;TSS (44.8), ISS (64.8), and OSS (-20.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #7, at &gt;     23:16 on a SL tide. &gt;TSS (616.0), ISS (504.0), and OSS (112.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #8, at &gt;     1:20 on a FL tide. &gt;TSS (513.3), ISS (408.3), and OSS (105.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #9, at &gt;     3:24 on a FH tide. &gt;TSS (276.7), ISS (218.3), and OSS (58.3) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #10, at &gt;     5:28 on a SH tide. &gt;TSS (231.7), ISS (180.0), and OSS (51.7) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #11, at &gt;     7:32 on a EH tide. &gt;TSS (146.7), ISS (110.7), and OSS (36.0) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #12, at &gt;     9:36 on a EL tide. &gt;TSS (122.7), ISS (92.0), and OSS (30.7) on 1/7/1998, event #85, sample #13, at &gt;     11:40 on a SL tide. Measurements during this period for all parameters exhibited a great deal of variability and some unusually high and low values.  The negative OSS values in particular seem difficult to believe.  In checking for errors in calculation, the Data Manager determined that the recorded oxidized weight for the two samples with negative OSS values (#6 and #7) were actually higher than the total weights, which is only possible as a result of laboratory or recording error.  After further investigation it was determined that the laboratory technician had difficulty filtering a large enough volume of sample for the entire sample event.  This indicates that there may have been a large amount of sediment sucked into the sampling mechanism.  A possible explanation is that the automated sampler was located on or near the sediment during sampling.  As a result, the Data Manager chose to highlight all of these measurements as anomalous and possibly erroneous.  In addition, the TPW measurement noted above was also unusually high for at least one sample during this same sample event.  This could indicate that other parameters were also affected during the event. &gt;NH4 (40.8) on 7/26/1998, event #95, sample #1, at 5:08 on SL tide. &gt;NH4 (42.7) on 7/26/1998, event #95, sample #7, at 17:32 on SL tide. These are very high values for the parameter relative to the typical measurements at this site.  They do not appear to correspond to elevated measurements of any other parameters but do both occur at a SL tide.  The Data Manager found no evidence of typographical or laboratory error; it is possible that the measurements are valid. &gt;TPW (17.0), TPF (11.9), and OP (10.57) on 12/2/2000, event #138, sample #1, at &gt;    7:08 on a SL tide. &gt;TPW (11.9), TPF (10.6), and OP (8.53) on 12/2/2000, event #138, sample #7, at &gt;    19:32 on a SL tide. &gt;TPW (11.1), TPF (9.6), and OP (7.88) on 12/2/2000, event #138, sample #13, at &gt;    7:56 on a SL tide. These values are all very high for the parameters relative to the typical measurements taken at this site.  They are attributed to a prescribed burn of interior upland pine forest that occurred on 11/30/2000.  All of the dramatically high values occurred at slack low tide, as would be expected if they were a result of runoff associated with the burned portion of the property.  Although only the highest values are noted here as anomalous, it is possible that the prescribed burn also affected other measurements taken for these and other parameters during this sampling period.  Another burn took place in the marsh and upland area to the northwest side of the TA sampling site on 1/28/2001.  The NH4 measurements appear to be elevated during SL tide in particular during sample events #139 and #140 (late December 2000 and early January 2001), but are not so elevated as to be considered anomalous.  These values are likely a delayed result of the fire.  In addition, it is also possible that elevated measurements taken for these parameters in earlier years were also a result of prescribed burns, and that the correlation was only realized and documented in 2000. </complete> <lineage> <method> <methtype>Field Collection Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Overall Field Collection Protocol 1000 ml (one Liter) samples were collected every 20 days at 2 hour and 4 minute intervals, for 2 complete tidal cycles (26 hours), with an ISCO automated water sampler at a depth of 0.5 meters below the water's surface.  Because the LTERDWS water sampling collections were taken every day at 10:00am EST, it was determined that the nutrient data were biased for Spring high tides; not all tides levels would be represented.  \"The complex interaction of a daily temporally fixed sampling design with seasonal, tidal, and diurnal cycles can result in serious aliasing and reduced usefulness of estuarine data\" (Hutchinson and Sklar, 1993). The new NERRWCHEM sampling protocols \"takes into account both solar and lunar influences and their interactions in order to represent actual estuarine conditions\".  It was determined that a 10 day sampling cycle (or multiples of 10) would represent all tidal stages when run over the years.  A 20-day schedule was selected for the NERRWCHEM project because if a 10-day interval was chosen, the water technician could not process all the sites samples in a timely fashion, and a 30 day schedule did not produce enough data points for the year. Justification for use of the autosampler technique can be found in the 1992 Calibration Study Ancillary Data.  {During this study comparisons were made between the water chemistry results obtained from the LTER DWS and the proposed NERRWCHEM sampling protocols.  There were no significant differences observed between the two methods, except for an increase in sediment load found in the autosampler samples.}  In the NERRWCHEM:  all sampling periods start and end at low tide.  The start times for sites located in the North Inlet Estuary are the predicted low tide times (EST) from the NOAA tide chart for Charleston, South Carolina.  The start times for the Winyah Bay site (TA) are the predicted low tide times from the tide chart plus one hour and 30 minutes (the calculated lag time between North Inlet and Thousand Acre based on water quality data logger water level data).  Sampling sites included Oyster Landing (OL), Thousand Acre (TA), Clambank Creek (CB), and Debidue Creek (DC) over the course of the database (see the Description of Geographic Extent section for more information on the sample sites).  Only the OL site was sampled throughout the entire database, beginning on June 2, 1993 through December of 2001. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Steve E. Hutchinson</origin> <origin>Fred H.

Salinity values were determined using a hand-held refractometer in the laboratory.  Seventy-five to 500 ml of the water samples were filtered through a preweighed, precombusted Whatman GFF 0.7 micrometer (nominal pore size) glass fiber filter to separate the particulates from the dissolved portion of the sample.  Samples were shaken before filtering began; the amount of water filtered was determined by how much sediment and other solids were in the sample.  During the winter, in the absence of phytoplankton blooms and when sedimentation was low, up to 500 ml of sample were filtered. During the summer, especially after periods of heavy rains, it wasn't possible to filter such a large volume. The determining factor in the amount of water filtered was the amount necessary to obtain a good sample of suspended solids on the filter, in order to get beyond the minimum detection limits of the TSS analysis. The filtered aliquots for TNF, TPF, NN, OP, and NH4, and non-filtered aliquots (or what remained on the 0.7 micrometer filter) for TNW and TPW, were analyzed with a Technicon AutoAnalyzer.  Filtered aliquots were also used for DOC analysis with a Shimadzu Carbon Analyzer.  Non-filtered samples were used in the Sequoia-Turner Fluorometer for chlorophyll a analysis and for the TSS, ISS, and OSS analyses. The Technicon and the Carbon Analyzer produced output printouts with raw nutrient value concentrations and DOC values.  With the Technicon model used for this database, there were no peak heights (as there were for the LTERDWS database); the technicon converted the peak heights directly into a nutrient concentration.  Results from all other analyses were recorded by hand. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Patricia M. Glibert</origin> <origin>Theodore C.

The filtrate (less than 0.7 micrometers) was used in the procedure to determine the TNF and TPF concentrations.  The TN &amp; TP method is a combination of two methods listed below, but in general the procedure consists of an alkaline persulfate oxidation followed by automated analysis for nitrogen (as nitrate) and phosphorus (as phosphate) on a Technicon AutoAnalyzer.  Oxidation reagent blanks (ORB) are run with each batch of persulfate digestion reagents. With alkaline persulfate digestion, all nitrogen in the sample was oxidized to nitrate, which was then reduced by cadmium and analyzed as nitrite.  The precision and recovery of this method compared favorably with a Kjeldahl procedure (D'Elia et al., 1977).  The main advantage of the persulfate oxidation is the speed and convenience with which it was accomplished.  Unlike the Kjeldahl method, which recovered only organic and NH4 - nitrogen, the persulfate oxidation also included NO3 and NO2 nitrogen. This semi-automated procedure combines the persulfate oxidation with automated nitrate and phosphate analysis to provide simultaneous analysis for total persulfate nitrogen (TPN) and total persulfate phosphorus (TTP) (Glibert et al., 1977).  Glibert's procedure has been further modified to use smaller sample sizes, so that the digestion flask can double as the sampler tray cup (Loder 1978).  With this method, many samples can be run quickly with a minimum of handling. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>C.F. D'Elia</origin> <origin>P.A. Steudler</origin> <origin>N.

The filter is then placed into a scintillation vial with 1 milliliter of saturated magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) and frozen.  Samples are removed from the freezer, 9 milliliters of 100 percent acetone are added, and then they are shaken and placed in the refrigerator for 24 hours.  The samples are removed from the refrigerator, carefully shaken, and then returned to the refrigerator for an additional 24 hours.  After the extraction process is complete, the samples are analyzed with a Fluorometer.  Analytical range can be adjusted by changing the volume of sample filtered. For samples collected from June 2, 1993 to December 20, 1993 a Turner Model 101 Fluorometer with a 430 nanometer filter was used.  At the 430 nanometer wavelength, Phaeophytin pigments are indistinguishable from Chlorophyll pigments.  As a result, while this fluorometer was in use, a total sample was run first, and then a Phaeophytin a value was obtained by adding 1.0 N Hydrochloric Acid and re-analyzing the sample.  The Phaeophytin value was then subtracted from the whole to give the Chlorophyll a value. Beginning with the January 8, 1994 sample event, a new Sequoia-Turner Model 450 Digital Fluorometer was used with a NB440 nanometer filter.  This filter is specific to chl a (FO) only, therefore, it was no longer necessary to analyze Phaeophytin.  Researchers attempted to use the 430 nanometer filter (which was used with the old fluorometer) for the July 27, 1994 sampling event in an attempt to return to the original protocol.  It was determined that the combination of the Model 450 fluorometer, SC665 Emission filter, and 430 nanometer filter was incompatible, and the resulting data were considered suspect.  See the Process Description Section for more information on equations used to determine final Chlorophyll a values for different time periods during the NERRWCHEM database. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Turner Designs Inc.</origin> <pubdate>198103</pubdate> <title>Fluorometric Facts, Chlorophyll and Phaeophytin</title> <geoform>Manual</geoform> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Ballentin 101, Mountain View, California</pubplace> <publish>Turner Designs</publish> </pubinfo> </citeinfo> </methcite> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Arnold E.

The DWS protocol entailed collecting a 1000 milliliter sample by submerging a glass bottle at a depth of 0.5 meters, at approximately 10:00 am every day, and processing the sample immediately.  The autosampler was programmed to sample (1000 milliliters) every 5.5 hours at the same depth and was left out for 24 hours at a time.  When the DWS sample was collected, the samples from the autosampler were also removed, and the autosampler was reprogrammed to continue sampling at 5.5-hour intervals.  The 5.5-hour interval was chosen because it would result in samples collected from every stage of the tide over the 2-week period (Hutchinson and Sklar, 1993).  Ice was placed in the autosampler to minimize decomposition or degradation of the samples.  This methodology allowed for 5 autosampler samples that were taken within 1 hour of the DWS sample to be processed immediately.  An additional four-autosampler samples that were taken within 1 hour of the DWS samples were processed approximately 24 hours after the DWS samples were processed.  The data from this study are not part of the core database, but are included as ancillary data.  The results and recommendations of the 1992 Calibration Study are unpublished but can be found in the NERRWCHEM hardcopy notebook at the BFML computer lab.

The data from this study are not part of the core database, but are included as ancillary data. </methdesc> </method> <procstep> <procdesc> Overall Description The database is compiled and maintained in yearly MS Excel Workbooks.  Prior to 1998, the sediment, nutrient, and chlorophyll data were kept in separate files, processed with SAS (Statistical Analysis System) programs, and then merged into one final yearly file.  Any calculations completed in the spreadsheets were found in the separate \"Process\" files or SAS files, not in the final file.  Most of these \"Process\" files are no longer available.  Beginning in 1998, each yearly Excel Workbook is composed of several different tabs (worksheets), including a \"FINAL.ALL.YYYY\" tab containing the final data for all parameters.  The other tabs represent \"Process\" spreadsheets for particular groups of parameters, such as sediment, nutrient, or chlorophyll.  Any calculations or manipulation of the data necessary to achieve the final data take place within these \"Process\" work sheets.  In this way, the critical process/calculation steps can be kept with the final data.  The process steps taken to reach the final database are explained below.  All data entry was verified, and edited if necessary, by a second data technician or data manager.  Archival and documentation of all raw, process, and final data was accomplished as part of the 2003 Data Rescue Project. Parameter Sheets: Salinity, Tide Elevation, Volume Filtered 1993-1997: When the water sample reaches the chemistry laboratory, salinity readings are taken with a refractometer and recorded for each water sample on a parameter sheet.  The parameter sheets are handwritten data sheets that include:  date, site, event #, sample #, time, salinity, high or low tide designation, filter #, sample volume filtered, and any pertinent comments.  Hardcopies of these datasheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet.  The datasheets have also been scanned into digital format and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  A data technician entered these data into yearly \"Process\" Excel spreadsheets.  The high and low tide designations were modified with a designation for each tide stage (ebb low, slack low, flood low, ebb high, slack high, or flood high).  These values were later copied directly into the final yearly Excel file. 1998-2001: (Added to Parameter Sheets: TSS, ISS, OSS, and sediment color) When the water sample reaches the chemistry laboratory, salinity readings are taken with a refractometer and recorded for each water sample on a parameter sheet.  Starting in 1998, the parameter sheets began a different format, and contain the sediment data so there is no need for sediment data sheets.  The new parameter sheets include:  chemistry #, date, site, event #, sample #, time, salinity, tide stage designation, filter #, filter weight, total weight, oxidized weight, and sediment color.  Hardcopies of these datasheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet.  The datasheets have also been scanned into digital format and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  A data technician entered these data into the \"parameter.sed\" \"Process\" tab of the yearly Excel Workbook.    These values were later copied directly into the final yearly Excel file. TNW, TNF, TPW, TPF, NN, NH4, OP Information on the samples in each tray of nutrients run through the technicon is recorded on a \"Run Sheet\" by the water chemistry technician.  The technicons have a datalogger that calculates the concentrations, puts them into a temporary text file, and produces an output printout with the same information.  Hardcopies of both the printouts and run sheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet and have been scanned into digital format and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  In the earlier years (1993-1995), the text file created by the technicon datalogger was also retained and these are archived on the NERRWCHEM.PROCESS CD in the \"RawDigitalFiles\" directory. 1993-1997: No corrections are necessary for the orthophosphate (OP), nitrate-nitrite (NN), or Ammonia (NH4) concentrations from the Technicon printout.  A data technician entered these data into yearly MS Excel nutrient files, and later copied the values directly into the final yearly Excel file. Whole and Filtered Total Nitrogen and Whole and Filtered Total Phosphorus data from the technicon printout do require corrections.  A data technican entered these data into yearly TNTP MS Excel files.  Within this file, a calculation was performed which took each concentration number, subtracted the Oxidizer Reagent Blank (ORB), and then multiplied the number by the Dilution factor.  The ORB values and dilution factors were supplied by the chemist. Once the totals were calculated, they were copied into the final yearly Excel file. 1998-2001: No corrections are necessary for the ortho phosphate (OP), Nitrate-Nitrite (NN), or Ammonia (NH4) concentrations from the Technicon printout.  After 1998, these data are recorded directly into a \"Process\" tab labeled \"param.nutr\", along with the relevant date, site, event #, and sample #.  After they have been corrected and certified error-free, they are later copied from this \"Process\" tab to the FINAL tab. Whole and Filtered Total Nitrogen and Whole and Filtered Total Phosphorus data from the technicon printout do require corrections. The correction formula was established in the \"TNTP\" \"Process\" tab of the Workbook. It takes each concentration number, subtracts the Oxidizer Reagent Blank (ORB), and then multiplies the number by the Dilution factor.  The ORB values and dilution factors are supplied by the chemist.  Once the totals are verified error-free and the final value is calculated, , the final values are copied from the TNTP \"Process\" tab into the FINAL spreadsheet tab. Chlorophyll a 1993-1997: Chlorophyll a (FO) readings from the fluorometer were recorded into a nalgene laboratory notebook.  This notebook also contains the sample site, date, door factor, fluorometer gain, sample volume, dilution factor, and other parameters important to the calculation of the final chlorophyll data.  The notebook is maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet.  The notebook pages were also scanned into digital images and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  A data technician entered the data from the notebook into a yearly MS Excel chlorophyll spreadsheet.  In 1993 and 1994, the Data Manager used this file to run the SAS program, \"chlaprog\", for the final calculated chlorophyll values.  These values were then copied into the final yearly Excel file.  \"Chlaprog\" changed throughout this period to adjust for the changes in sample volume and door factors. The program was archived on the NERRWCHEM.PROCESS CD as part of the 2003 Data Rescue Project.  Examples of the program can also be found in the NERRWCHEM 1993-2001 Notebook maintained on site at the BMFL.  The basic program is as follows: &gt;INPUT CREEK $ SAMP DAY DDMMYY6. DOOR $ FO FA VSAMPLE; &gt;IF DOOR='3X' THEN FD=0.3012; &gt;IF DOOR='10X' THEN FD=0.1175; &gt;IF DOOR='1X' THEN FD=0.8523; &gt;IF DOOR='30X' THEN FD=0.0403; &gt;IF VSAMPLE=10 THEN VOLFAC=1; &gt;IF VSAMPLE=20 THEN VOLFAC=0.5; &gt;CHL_A=FD*2.10*(FO-FA)*VOLFAC; &gt;PHAE_A=FD*2.10*((1.91*FA)-FO)*VOLFAC; &gt;RATIO=FO/FA;  DROP FD; 1998-2001: Chlorophyll readings were recorded onto new Chlorophyll data sheets that also contained the sample site, date, door factor, fluorometer gain, sample volume, dilution factor, and other parameters important to the calculation of the final chlorophyll data.  Hardcopies of the data sheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet.  The data sheets were also scanned into digital images and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  A data technician entered the values from the data sheets into the \"param.chla\" \"Process\" tab of the yearly MS Excel Workbook, where final values are calculated in micrograms per liter and copied to the FINAL tab of the Workbook. Protocol and Calculation Process Documentation (1993-2001): Calculated chlorophyll values (in micrograms per liter) are derived using the raw data and predetermined door factors and gain factor.  For those samples that were acidified, a Tau value is also calculated and incorporated into the formula.  Over the course of the database, there have been changes in equipment and protocol.  Therefore, with changes in filters, fluorometers, door factor values, etc., the calculation process has also evolved.  The following are explanations and formulas for individual time periods of chlorophyll data. &gt;Where, &gt; FD = Door Factor (as calculated for each door) &gt; FO = Chla reading &gt; FA = Phae reading &gt; Gain = Gain value &gt; Volume filtered = 10 or 20ml, normally 10ml as of 1 May and 20ml on 1 December &gt; Volume Extract = 10ml, from Greenberg et al. (1980) &gt; Tau(T) = acid factor (as calculated) June 2, 1993 - December 20, 1993; Events 1-11: The processing of data for this time period was based on a Turner Model 101 Fluorometer with a 430 nanometer filter.  Phaeophytin and chlorophyll a are analyzed using this instrumentation.  Analytical range can be adjusted by changing the volume of sample filtered.  FA was analyzed by the addition of 1.0 N Hydrochloric Acid due to the interference at the 430 nanometer wavelength.  Tau is used in the calculation formula. &gt;Chl (ug/L) = (FD((T/T-1)(FO-FA))  FD values  Tau(T) = 1.91 &gt;     1x = 0.8523 (T/T-1) = 2.10 &gt;Phae (ug/L) = (FD((T/T-1)(1.91FA))-FO) 3x = 0.3012 &gt;     10x = 0.1175 &gt;     30x = 0.0403 January 8, 1994 - July 7, 1994; Events 12-21: The processing of chlorophyll data for this time period was based on a new Sequoia-Turner Model 450 Fluorometer, a SC 665 nanometer emission filter, and a NB 440 nanometer excitation filter.  This filter does not allow for the measurement of the FA wavelength and is specific to chlorophyll a (FO) only.  Neither Tau nor FA values are used in the final calculation.  This filter combination was used for samples from January 8, 1994 through July 7, 1994. &gt;      FD values &gt;         ((FD)(FO)(50)(vol. extract))  1x = 2.19 &gt;Chl (ug/L) =(vol. filtered)(Gain)   3x = 0.14 &gt;      10x=0.03 &gt;      30x=0.021 July 27-28, 1994; Event 22: The processing of chlorophyll data for this sampling event was based on a different excitation filter than previously used.  For this sample event only, the Sequoia-Turner Model 450 Fluorometer and SC 665 Emission filter were used with a 430 nanometer excitation filter.  This was an attempt to return to the protocol used with the old Turner Fluorometer during the LTER DWS database and the first few months of the NERR database.  This would have made for easier comparisons between the two databases and allowed for the continued collection of phaeophytin data.  However, it was determined that the 430 nm filter was not compatible with the SC 665 Emission filter and the Model 450 fluorometer.  The fluorometer did not zero correctly, and all data are suspect for this sampling event.  Tau and FA values were used in the calculation for these data. &gt;     FD values  Tau(T) = 1.689 &gt;           FD((T/T-1)(FO-FA))  1x = 0.392 (T/T-1) = 2.451 &gt;Chl (ug/L) = (vol. filtered)(Gain)  3x = 0.0256 &gt;     10x = 0.0055 &gt;     30x = 0.00369 August 16, 1994 - July 23, 1995; Events 23-40: The processing of chlorophyll data for this time period was based on the Sequoia-Turner Model 450 Fluorometer, SC 665 nanometer emission filter, and NB 440 nanometer excitation filter.  The \"span\" knob was turned to maximum for these sampling events.  This filter does not allow for the measurement of the FA wavelength and is specific to chlorophyll a (FO) only.  Neither Tau nor FA values are used in the final calculation.  In order to correct for the maximum \"span\" setting, the denominator is multiplied by 6.4. &gt;      FD values &gt;   ((FD)(FO)(50)(vol. extract)  1x = 5.38 &gt;Chl (ug/L) =   ((vol. filtered)(Gain)(6.4))  3x = 0.379 &gt;      10x = 0.09 &gt;      30x = 0.053 July 23, 1995 - December 14, 1998; Events 41-102: Data processing for chlorophyll since July 23 has been completed using the Sequoia-Turner Model 450 Fluorometer, SC 665 nanometer emission filter, and NB 440 nanometer excitation filter.  This filter does not allow for the measurement of the FA wavelength and is specific to chlorophyll a (FO) only.  Neither Tau nor FA values are used in the final calculation.  The \"span\" knob for this period was turned to minimum, and as a result, it was no longer necessary to use the correction factor (6.4) for maximum span in the denominator. &gt;       ((FD)(FO)(50)(vol. extract))  FD values &gt;Chl (ug/L)=          ((vol. filtered)(Gain))  1x=5.38 &gt;      3x=0.379 &gt;      10x=0.09 &gt;      30x=0.053 January 2, 1999 - December 18, 2001; Events 103-157: Data processing for this period was the same as above, with the exception of the new door factors listed below. &gt;       ((FD)(FO)(50)(vol. extract))  FD values &gt;Chl (ug/L)=          ((vol. filtered)(Gain))  1x=8.76 &gt;      3x=0.46 &gt;      10x=0.107 &gt;      30x=0.077 Suspended Solids (TSS, ISS, OSS) 1993-1997: Filter number, weights of pre-weighed filters, dried sample weights for TSS, muffled sample weights for OSS, volume filtered, and sediment color were hand written onto a datasheets.  These datasheets were kept in a notebook, which is maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet.  In 2003, the datasheets were also scanned into digital images and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  A data technician entered all the data from the notebook, except the sediment color, into a yearly MS Excel sediment spreadsheet.  In 1993-1995, the Data Manager used a SAS program called \"SEDSORT\" that compares the sediment filter number in the sediment file and the particular parameter file (created from parameter sheets).  It makes another file out of the raw sediment file with just the filter numbers that match the parameter file.  A second SAS program called \"PARSED\" merges the presorted sediment file (from SEDSORT) with the appropriate parameter file, resulting in a merged file with parameters and sediment values.  As part of the 2003 Data Rescue Project, versions of the SEDSORT and PARSED SAS programs were archived on the NERRWCHEM.PROCESS CD and in the NERRWCHEM 1993-2001 Notebook. 1998-2001: Starting in 1998, the weights of the pre-weighed filters, dried sample weights for TSS, muffled sample weights for OSS, volume filtered, and sediment color were recorded on newly designed water parameter sheets.  These datasheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet.  In 2003, they were scanned into digital images and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD.  A data technician entered the values from the parameter sheets (except for sediment color) into the \"parameter.sed\" \"Process\" tab of the yearly MS Excel workbook, where final values were calculated using the following formulas.  The final values are then copied to the FINAL tab of the workbook. Calculations: Total Sediment value (g) = [Total wt.(g) minus (-) Filter weight(g)]. Organic Sediment value (g) = [Total wt.(g) minus (-) Oxidized wt.(g)] Inorganic Sediment value (g) = [Total sediment value(g) minus (-) Organic sediment value(g)] TO CONVERT TO MILLIGRAMS PER LITER: Total Suspended Solids (TSS) (mg/L) = [[[Total Sediment value (g) times (x) 1000] divided by (/) volume of water sample filtered (ml)] times (x) 1000] Organic Suspended Solids (OSS) (mg/L) = [[[Organic Sediment value (g) times (x) 1000] divided by (/) volume of water sample filtered (ml)] times (x) 1000] Inorganic Suspended Solids (ISS) (mgL) = [[[Inorganic Sediment value (g) times (x) 1000] divided by (/) volume of water sample filtered (ml)] times (x) 1000] Carbon (DOC) Information on the samples in each tray run through the Shimadzu Carbon Analyzer is recorded on a \"Run Sheet\" by the Water Chemistry Technician.  The carbon analyzer produces an output printout with three DOC concentrations (in mg/L) and an average of the three concentrations for each sample.  Hardcopies of both the printouts and run sheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's water chemistry laboratory fireproof cabinet and have been scanned into digital format and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD. 1993-1997: A data technician entered the average value of the three DOC concentrations into the \"Process\" nutrient Excel spreadsheet.  These values were later copied directly into the final yearly version. 1998-2001: A data technician entered the average value of the three DOC concentrations into the \"param.nutr\" \"Process\" tab of the yearly Excel workbook.  They are later copied from this \"Process\" tab to the FINAL tab. Ancillary Data (Sediment Color, Grab Samples, and 1992 Calibration Study) Sediment Color The sediment color data, including sample date, site, filter number, filter weight, total weight, and oxidized weight were entered into separate MS Excel spreadsheet.  As part of the 2003 Data Rescue Project, sediment color data from 1998 to 2001 were input into yearly MS Excel files, called SEDCOLOR.  The 1998 - 2001 SEDCOLOR files were appended at the end of an already existing sediment \"Process\" file for the years 1993-1997.  In 2003, all the files were verified, formatted, and included in the NERRWCHEM final database as ancillary data file \"NERRWCHEM.SEDCOLOR.1993-2001.xls\". Grab Samples Extra grab samples began in 2001.  They were labeled 13B and 13C and processed in the laboratory with the same methods as \"regular\" samples described above.  A data technician entered the supplemental data with the rest of the regular samples into each \"Process\" tab (i.e. Chla, Nutr, Sed, TNTP) of the NERRWCHEM Workbook.  However, the final calculated grab data were not included in the \"FINAL.ALL.2001\" tab or the final database.  Final data from the grab samples, including sample #13, were copied into a \"GrabSamples-Final\" tab of the Workbook; this tab was exported as its own file called 2001.GrabSamples.csv and was placed into the ancillary data directory. 1992 Calibration Study All documentation regarding the 1992 Calibration Study was scanned into digital format and archived on the NERRWCHEM.RAW Archive CD as part of the 2003 Data Rescue Project.  Hardcopies were archived in the NERRWCHEM 1993-2001 Notebook.  The original 2-week database includes all the data for the autosampler and the Daily Water Sample samples.  The comparison database that compared results between the two techniques was entered into an Excel Workbook in 2003 as part of the Rescue Project.  The contents of the file are as follows: one tab contains the data and t-test results for the immediate processing of autosampler and DWS samples with the Technicon; another tab contains the data and t-test results for 24 hour delay in sample workup.  These results were included in the final database as ancillary data file \"1992Calib.Study.Results.xls\". Creation of Final Database Yearly water chemistry, sediment, and chlorophyll Excel files from 1993-1997 were manipulated and merged using a SAS program called \"Wcchla92-97.merge.sas\".  (Note: this program can be found in either the NERRWCHEM.PROCESS CD or in the NERRWCHEM 1993-2001 Notebook maintained by the BMFL Data Manager).  This program outputs the merged database in a flat file (text).  The database was then imported into Excel, verified and formatted.  FINAL spreadsheets in the yearly 1998 - 2001 workbooks were verified, formatted for consistency, and merged with the 1993 - 1997 database to form one complete database.  The complete database was broken into subcomponents by sample site, graphed, missing data were marked with a missing data marker \".\", and anomalous data were assessed and removed if determined to be erroneous.  A complete record of missing data and anomalous/erroneous data can be found in the Completeness Report portion of this document.  The final sample-site databases were re-combined into a single complete database for users that might prefer a single database. The complete database, the site specific subcomponent databases, the ancillary databases, and the 1998-2001 \"Process\" spreadsheets were archived in both .xls and .csv formats on the NERRWCHEM.PUBLISH CD, in the NERRWCHEM notebook, and on-line at http://links.baruch.sc.edu/data/. </procdesc> <procdate> 2003 </procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>North Inlet and Winyah Bay Estuaries are part of Hobcaw Barony and are located in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA.
