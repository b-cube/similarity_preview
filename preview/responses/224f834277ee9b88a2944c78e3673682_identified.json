It is a very important region especially in relation to international commerce and global security, and links several heavily populated coastal megacities that have active societal, economic and industrial significance. This marginal seas is also a region of the highest marine biodiversity in the world, and its coral reefs and waters around atolls and small islands serve as the spawning grounds and nurseries of many marine species including tuna and other pelagic species that serve as very important food commodities in the Pacific islands, the Asia mainland and in North America. The region also lies along the path of destructive typhoons that originate in the Western North Pacific and affect the Philippines, Vietnam, Hong Kong, China, Korea, and Japan. About 26 typhoons are generated annually in this region, the majority of which impact the Philippine region. Conserving the health and wellbeing of the marginal seas, and the peoples that rely on them, while coping with the pressures of global change, is an urgent imperative.</span></p> <p><span>Dubbed SIMSEA, the Sustainability Initiative in the Marginal Seas of East Asia, this initiative aims to:</span></p> <p><span>1) develop the knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change, and </span></p> <p><span>2) support transformation towards global sustainability in the region in the coming decades. </span></p> <p><span>The main region of the proposed study will be the Exclusive Economic Zone beyond the territorial limit (generally 12 nautical miles from shore) as well as in the international waters relevant to the sustainable use of common areas. The collaboration will involve joint researches and capacity building projects particularly of young scientist in developing countries in the region. </span></p> <p>The pre-scoping workshop held on 27 and 28 February, 2014 at the Yokohama Institute for Earth Sciences of JAMSTEC (<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/research/index.html\">http://www.jamstec.go.jp/e/about/research/index.html</a>).

Sixteen other Japanese Universities from all over the country participated in the meeting and the opportunity was used to provide those present with a clear account of the development of Future Earth in Asia and identify potential opportunities for collaboration in the development of capacity for research, education and training in sustainability studies throughout the region. All participating universities have a graduate level Environmental Leadership Programme (ELP) that has been strongly supported and funded by the Government of Japan. Fumiko Kasuga the Vice President of the Science Council of Japan also participated in the discourse. The Director of ROAP provided a historical account of the development of Future Earth, its scope, progress and roles played by various institutions and organizations in Asia and elsewhere in the development of awareness and understanding about Future Earth. He provided insights considered valuable by the participants on the necessary next steps and the vital building blocks for the successful establishment of multidisciplinary integrated research in Asia that are solutions oriented for the benefit of society. Fumiko Kasuga presented a detailed update on the state of affairs in the development of the distributed secretariat to manage Future Earth at the global, regional and local contexts. Michael Norton a professor at the Graduate School presented the concept of a Future Earth Integrated Education and Research Centre that Tohoku University plans to establish. The Centre aims to play a key role in developing capacity for Future Earth in the region, building on its current ELP. Compared to the current ELP the proposed programme at the Centre will have the following additional features:</span></p> <ul> <li>It will engage with multiple stakeholders in mutual learning and co-design with regard to the Centre\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds programmes and activities;</li> <li>It aims to broaden the existing ELP focus to include agenda essential for global sustainability;</li> <li>It will develop\\ufffd\\ufffd and promote educational materials and methodologies to support training programmes for Future Earth in the region;</li> <li>It will provide opportunities for strengthening the collaborative links for research and education for global sustainability with institutions in Asia and elsewhere; and</li> <li>It will strengthen networking among institutions providing education for sustainable development within the context of Future Earth in Asia and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). </li> </ul> <p>The establishment of such a centre at Tohoku University can provide an initial test-bed for ideas on how to organise the infrastructure to develop the intellectual capacity of nations in the region to meet the needs of Future Earth for co-designed, co-produced and co-disseminated scientific knowledge vital for achieving global sustainability.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Capacity building</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable development</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global sustainability research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Earth system science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Strategic planning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global environmental change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Education</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Regional Offices</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-01-28T15:20:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/apn-report-on-mairs-strategic-planning-workshop-on-future-earth-in-asia\">     <title>APN report on MAIRS strategic planning workshop on Future Earth in Asia</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/news-centre/news/apn-report-on-mairs-strategic-planning-workshop-on-future-earth-in-asia</link>     <description>Mission report of MAIRS strategic planning workshop on Future Earth</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) has published a mission report of the Monsoon Asia Integrated Regional Study (MAIRS)-organised meeting to input into Future Earth and to develop a strategic science plan for a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFuture Asia\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

It will discuss the research themes of Future Earth in general and review progress of global change studies in China especially with regard to climate change prediction, science-policy interface, biodiversity monitoring and informatics, and natural disaster management and mitigation. Urbanization and urban development will also be a focus of discussions, as will China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds strategy on energy for sustainable development. Of particular interest is the discussion at the Workshop on the topic of working with social scientists and policy makers. Future Earth aims to engage more fully with decision and policy-makers and involve more social and other scientists in the co-design of solutions oriented research that would contribute towards global sustainability. The President of ICSU will deliver a keynote speech that aims to provide an Asian perspective on sustainable development. The Director of the ICSU Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) summarised the findings of the many national, regional and sub-regional Future Earth workshops held in Asia and the Pacific since the end of 2012.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Mohd Nordin Hasan</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>International Research Collaboration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global sustainability research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Earth system science</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Strategic planning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global environmental change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Science for Policy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Research and development</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-09-26T00:54:45Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/events/ICSU%20Events/31st-general-assembly\">     <title>31st General Assembly</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/asia-pacific/events/ICSU%20Events/31st-general-assembly</link>     <description>The 31st General Assembly of the International Council for Science (ICSU) will take place in Auckland, New Zealand, from 30 August to 3 September 2014.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>All information on the General Assembly can be found at the portal accessible through the link below.

The APN part funded the workshop that was organised as a first step to provide a regional context to the conceptualization of <i>Future Earth. </i>It was part of a broader ICSU consultation process on <i>Future Earth </i>in the regions. The workshop was successful in building an understanding of <i>Future Earth </i>among participants, providing information on current initiatives and developing a common vision for <i>Future Earth </i>in the Asia-Pacific region. The key recommendations made at the workshop refer to the coordination and convergence of activities under <i>Future Earth. </i>These included the needed learning and capacity development initiatives, and elements of science-policy and stakeholder interfaces required to make <i>Future Earth </i>a success. The Asia-Pacific region has the capacity to drive the transition towards global sustainability under the <i>Future Earth </i>programme. Its scientific community is ready to make the change to support integrated research that can build new ways to engage developed and less developed countries and help ensure socially-inclusive and environmentally-sound development. National-level workshops have been held in Chinese Taipei, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia. An international workshop on <i>Future Earth </i>in China will be held next week (26\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd27 September 2013) in Beijing.
