It is formed from the linkage of the universal Health Card registration system, 2001 Census returns, and vital statistics data.  NILS contains a unique Health and Care Number that enables linkage to other health service databases. It is maintained by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). The 2001 Census records provided most of the attributes of the NILS cohort members, also contextual information relating to household composition and interpersonal relationships, and characteristics of the household and area of residence.   The vital events linked to NILS were used to determine whether a cohort member had been bereaved between April 2001 (the time of the Census) and the end of December 2009. The 2001 Census asked questions about relationship to other people living in the household, these questions were used to determine who a cohort member lived with, and the vital events records identified co-resident family members\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd deaths. Approximately 96% of death records are routinely linked to the NILS dataset using a mixture of exact and probabilistic matching.   Data relating to medications that have been prescribed by a General Practitioner and dispensed from community pharmacies have been collated centrally in an Enhanced Prescribing Database (EPD) since 2009. Each prescription record contains the individual\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Health and Care Number, a General Practice (GP) identifier, the drug name and British National Formulary (BNF) category.  Information was extracted for antidepressant and anxiolytic medications (BNF categories 4.1.2 and 4.3) for the period January 1st to February 28th 2010. Health and Care Number allowed exact matching between prescribing and NILS records. The linkage process was carried out by the EPD and NILS data custodians. The linked dataset was then anonymised before being supplied to the researchers, and was held in a secure setting (9). At no time were patient identifiable data available.
