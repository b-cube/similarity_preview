Backscatter data are provided as two separate grids depending on mapping system (Reson 7125 and Reson 8101). The raster data file is included in \"BackscatterB_7125_OffshoreSanGregorio.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSanGregorio/data_catalog_OffshoreSanGregorio.html.  The acoustic-backscatter map of the Offshore of San Gregorio, California was generated from backscatter data collected by Fugro Pelagos and by California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB). Mapping was completed in 2006 and 2007, using a combination of 400-kHz Reson 7125 and 244-kHz Reson 8101 multibeam echosounders. Within the final imagery, brighter tones indicate higher backscatter intensity, and darker tones indicate lower backscatter intensity. The intensity represents a complex interaction between the acoustic pulse and the seafloor, as well as characteristics within the shallow subsurface, providing a general indication of seafloor texture and composition. Backscatter intensity depends on the acoustic source level; the frequency used to image the seafloor; the grazing angle; the composition and character of the seafloor, including grain size, water content, bulk density, and seafloor roughness; and some biological cover. Harder and rougher bottom types such as rocky outcrops or coarse sediment typically return stronger intensities (high backscatter, lighter tones), whereas softer bottom types such as fine sediment return weaker intensities (low backscatter, darker tones). </abstract> <purpose>These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public.

KGPS altitude data (Fugro Pelagos, StarFix HP &amp; XP units; CSUMB, NavCom 2050) were used to account for tide cycle fluctuations and sound velocity profiles were collected with an Applied Microsystems SVPlus sound velocimeter. Soundings were corrected for vessel motion using the Applanix POS/MV data, for variations in water-column sound velocity using the AM SVPlus data, and for variations in water height (tides) using vertical-position data from the KGPS receivers. Backscatter data were processed using Geocoder Version 3.2 (Fugro Pelagos Modified Test Release 16). Within Geocoder, the backscatter intensities were radiometrically corrected (including despeckling and angle varying gain adjustments) and the position of each acoustic sample was geometrically corrected for slant range. After the lines were imported, they were mosaicked into a 1m resolution image. Overlap between parallel lines was resolved using a priority table based on the distance of each sample from the ship track, with samples closest to- and furthest from- the ship track given the lowest priority. An anti-aliasing algorithm was also applied.</procdesc> <procdate>2007</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Carrie Bretz</cntper> <cntorg>Seafloor Mapping Lab, California State University Monterey Bay</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>Projects Manager, GIS; Metadata Supervisor</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address>100 Campus Center, Bldg 13</address> <city>Seaside</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>93955</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(831) 582-4197</cntvoice> <cntemail>carrie_bretz@csumb.edu</cntemail> </cntinfo> </proccont> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>California Seafloor Mapping Project 1- and 2-m resolution backscatter imagery (CSMP survey blocks CC-07, CC-08, CC-09) within this map were downloaded from California State University, Monterey Bay, Seafloor Mapping Lab (http://seafloor.csumb.edu/SFMLwebDATA.htm) and converted to grids.
