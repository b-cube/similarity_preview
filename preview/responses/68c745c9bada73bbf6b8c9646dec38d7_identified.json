Depiction of the vulnerability of soils to wind erosion requires development of a wind-erosion GIS model, measurement of wind speed, direction, and duration at specific sites, experimentation using portable wind tunnels on disturbed and undisturbed geomorphic surfaces, and the development of GIS data layers depicting wind potential and other factors related to wind erosion. Increased water-erosion potential following disturbances is an important part of landscape vulnerability, and quantification of sediment yields allows an assessment of the natural variability in water-transported sediment and organic material, including seeds of native and non-native plants. One of the key landscape elements that minimizes both wind and water erosion is the presence and types of cryptobiotic crusts mantling soil surfaces. Soil crusts are an important process control on surficial erosion and also influence wind dispersal of vascular plants. A regional assessment will be conducted of the distribution and species composition of crusts, as well as their fragility to disturbance.</abstract> <purpose>The field and process studies and insights gained from these background studies will form the scientific framework necessary to conceptualize and parameterize vulnerability and recoverability models for desert ecosystems. These models will use the detailed data and measurements available from the field sites to estimate vulnerability and recoverability rates for regions surrounding the sites and then to larger regions and the entire ecosystem at decreasing levels of reliability.  Subsequent to the initiation of site studies and model development will be development of a comprehensive regional monitoring strategy for land managers to assess, on a continuing basis, the vital signs of the ecosystem. This strategy will make use of remote sensing to supplement field observation to improve efficiency and improve spatial attributes of desert health estimates. Incorporation of these assessment measures (particularly over time) with vulnerability and recoverability models in a decision support system will give land managers a multiscale look at ecosystem health yesterday, today, and tomorrow.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>199803</begdate> <enddate>Present</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Ground

At each site, a 100 x 100 m2 plot was designated, photographed, and its GPS coordinates recorded.  Within each plot, an area closest to the nearest road was designated for windtunnel experiments, and three parallel, 100 m long transects were established.</methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Gillette</origin> <pubdate>1978</pubdate> <title>Gillette 1978 article</title> </citeinfo> </methcite> </method> <method> <methtype>Lab</methtype> <methodid> <methkt>none</methkt> <methkey>wind tunnel experiments</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc> A portable, open-bottomed wind tunnel, 150 mm x 150 mm cross section by 2.4 m length was used so that a variable-speed turbulent boundary layer could be formed over the desert surface (Gillette, 1978).  The tunnel used a 5:1 contraction section with a honeycomb flow straightener and a roughly conical diffuser attached to the working section.  Wind speed data were collected at several heights above the surface midway across the end of the working section.  The Pitot tube anemometer was calibrated and corrected for temperature and pressure changes. Rock fragment size, soil particle size, friction threshold velocity, and sediment production were determined for each plot in the wind tunnel experiment. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Gillette</origin> <pubdate>1978</pubdate> <title>Gillette 1978 article</title> </citeinfo> </methcite> </method> <method> <methtype>Lab</methtype> <methodid> <methkt>none</methkt> <methkey>rock fragment size distribution</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc>Additional measurements of rock fragment size distribution were made for the wind tunnel plots in order to facilitate future comparisons with other datasets. Eight 30cm-long rulers (transects) were laid along the length of the wind tunnel at a 45 degree angle to the direction of the tunnel. Size of rock fragments were read until 15 measurements were made on each transect.  On the disturbance plots, the area immediately outside the tunnel was sampled with rock transects after disturbance was applied,. On the control plot, the area in the center of the tunnel was sampled before the wind tunnel was put in place.</methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Lab</methtype> <methodid> <methkt>none</methkt> <methkey>particle size</methkey> <methkey>texture</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc>Soil samples were collected from the top 5 mm of soil for particle size analysis. Samples were taken alongside the wind tunnel until eight samples, or 250g of soil, were collected. One sample was taken for control wind tunnels and 2 samples were taken near the disturbed wind tunnels, one before and one after the disturbance.</methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Lab</methtype> <methodid> <methkt>none</methkt> <methkey>threshold velocity</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc>The friction threshold velocity was defined as the velocity at which fragments were initially detached from the soil surface. Wind speed inside the wind tunnel was gradually increased until forward particle movement was observable across the soil surface.  The air-flow velocity was then recorded at the soil surface and 0.32, 0.64, 1.27, 2.54, 5.08, 7.62 and 10.16 cm above the surface to create an air-flow profile.  Wind speeds were then increased until surface integrity of the crusts was compromised, at which point an additional air-profile was recorded.  Data for the mean horizontal wind velocity U (cm sec-1) versus height z (mm; wind profile data) were fitted to the function for aerodynamically rough flow (Priestley, 1959), using a nonlinear least squares routine where U*t is friction velocity, zo is roughness height characteristic of the surface, and k is Von Karman's constant.  Threshold velocities and aerodynamic roughness heights are reported in terms of friction velocity and roughness height.  Threshold friction velocities (TFV; the force required to detach soil particles from the surface) were determined for disturbed and undisturbed (control) plots within each of the replicated sites.</methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Priestly</origin> <pubdate>1959</pubdate> <title>Priestly 1959 article</title> </citeinfo> </methcite> </method> <method> <methtype>Lab</methtype> <methodid> <methkt></methkt> <methkey>sediment production</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc>Immediately following the measurement of the air-flow profile, the wind speed inside the tunnel was increased until air-flow velocity, as measured with the Pitot anemometer placed 7.62 cm above the surface, reached a value of 0.3 inches of mercury.  This value is approximately equivalent to 42.5 km hr-1, which is a wind velocity typically reached in the Mojave during strong spring storms.  The wind tunnel was run at this speed for three minutes, then stopped.  During this time, all the sediment blown off the soil surface was trapped in filter at the end of the tunnel. This synthetic fiberglass filter with a 1 ?m pore size was pre-weighed, so that following the experiment the filter and any particles it had stopped could be collected, returned to the laboratory, where organic material was sifted out, and then weighed to determine the mass of sediment blown off the soil under the wind tunnel.</methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Field</methtype> <methodid> <methkt></methkt> <methkey>transect data</methkey> </methodid> <methdesc>At each meter point along each of the three transects, the ground cover was described at each point hit by the 1.00 m mark of a measuring tape.  Biological soil crust hits were identified to genus.  Other descriptors included surface roughness, rock size, litter cover, bioturbation, plant base, canopy height.  The same transects were used to measure vegetation cover, with a method descirbed by Musick.  At approximately 60 places, randomly chosen along the three transects, soil samples were taken using a &amp;frac34;&amp;#148; soil corer from the following depths: 0-0.5 cm, 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm.  The 30 samples were composited into 2 separate samples for each depth.  These samples were returned to the laboratory, and measured for soil texture and chemistry.</methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Musick, H.B.</origin> <pubdate>1998</pubdate> <title>Field monitoring of vegetation characteristics related to surface changes in the Yuma Desert, AZ, and at the Jornada Experimental Range in the Chihuanhuan Desert, NM.</title> <geoform>Journal article</geoform> <serinfo> <sername>U.S. Geological Society Professional Paper</sername> <issue>1598-D.</issue> </serinfo> </citeinfo> </methcite> </method> <procstep> <procdesc>unknown</procdesc> <procdate>unknown</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>Based on local reference names.</indspref> </spdoinfo> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>Entity - Biological Soil crusts, soil surfaces, vegetation structure; Associated attributes - percent cover of soil surface features, vegetation structure and spacing, threshold friction velocity, rock fragment size distribution, depth of AV horizon, wind tunnel sediment production, soil texture and particle size, soil chemistry, soil surface chlorophyll a content.</eaover> <eadetcit>unknown</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Jayne Belnap</cntper> <cntorg>Forest and Rangelands Ecosystems Science Center</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address>2290 SW Resource Boulevard</address> <city>Moab</city> <state>UT</state> <postal>84532</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>435-719-2333</cntvoice> <cntfax>435-719-2300</cntfax> <cntemail>jayne_belnap@nps.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </distrib> <distliab>Although these data have been processed successfully on a computer system at the U.S. Geological Survey, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the accuracy or utility of the data on any other system or for general or scientific purposes, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty.
