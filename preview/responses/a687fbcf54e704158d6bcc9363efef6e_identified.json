The acquisition was performed by Terrapoint. This metadata covers the LiDAR produced for the Virginia Counties North project area. The nominal pulse spacing for this project is 1.6 ft (0.5 meters). This project was collected with a sensor which collects intensity values for each discrete pulse extracted from the waveform. GPS Week Time, Intensity, Flightline and echo number attributes were provided for each LiDAR point.  Dewberry used proprietary procedures to classify the LAS according to contract specifications:  1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10-Ignored Ground due to breakline proximity, and 11-Withheld.  Dewberry produced 3D breaklines and combined these with the final LiDAR data to produce seamless hydro flattened DEMs for the 2,140 tiles (5000 ft x 5000 ft) that cover the project area.</abstract>       <purpose>The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy 3D elevation products, including tiled LiDAR in LAS 1.2 format, 3D breaklines, and a 2.5 ft cell size hydro flattened Digital Elevation Models (DEM).</purpose>       <supplinf>A complete description of this dataset is available in the Final Project Report.</supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>20110419</begdate>           <enddate>20120210</enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>ground condition</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>As needed</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-77.639869</westbc>         <eastbc>-77.213781</eastbc>         <northbc>38.790665</northbc>         <southbc>38.222260</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>None</themekt>         <themekey>DTM</themekey>         <themekey>Elevation</themekey>         <themekey>Lidar</themekey>         <themekey>LAS</themekey>         <themekey>DEM</themekey>         <themekey>Hydro Flattened</themekey>         <themekey>Breaklines</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>None</placekt>         <placekey>Virginia</placekey>         <placekey>Essex</placekey>         <placekey>King George</placekey>         <placekey>Prince William</placekey>         <placekey>Richmond</placekey>         <placekey>Stafford</placekey>         <placekey>Westmoreland</placekey>         <placekey>Manassas</placekey>         <placekey>Manassas Park</placekey>         <placekey>Fredericksburg</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>None</accconst>     <useconst>This data was produced for the USGS and FEMA according to specific project requirements.

The survey checkpoints are distributed throughout the project area. These 66 checkpoints contain 21 open terrain points, 24 crops/weeds points, and 21 forested points. The 66 checkpoints were used to compute the Fundamental Vertical Accuracy (FVA) and the Consolidated Vertical Accuracy (CVA).

Flights were flown with a minimum of 6 satellites in view (13o above the horizon) and with a PDOP of better than 4. Distances from base station to aircraft were kept to a maximum of 40 km, to ensure a strong OTF (On-The-Fly) solution. For all flights, the GPS data can be classified as excellent, with GPS residuals of 3cm average but no larger than 10 cm being recorded.  The Geoid09 geoid model, published by the NGS, was used to transform all ellipsoidal heights to orthometric. </procdesc>         <srcused>Control_Network</srcused>         <srcused>Raw_GPS_IMU</srcused>         <procdate>201104</procdate>         <srcprod>Processed_Trajectory</srcprod>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc> - Generation and Calibration of laser points Laser data points are generated using Optech's software Dashmap.

All LiDAR related processes begin by importing the data into the GeoCue task management software. GeoCue allows the data to retain its delivered tiling scheme (5000 ft by 5000 ft). The tiled data is then opened in Terrascan where Dewberry uses proprietary ground classification routines to remove any non-ground points and generate an accurate ground surface. The ground routine consists of three main parameters (building size, iteration angle, and iteration distance); by adjusting these parameters and running several iterations of this routine an initial ground surface is developed. The building size parameter sets a roaming window size. Each tile is loaded with neighboring points from adjacent tiles and the routine classifies the data section by section based on this roaming window size. The second most important parameter is the maximum terrain angle, which sets the highest allowed terrain angle within the model. Once the ground routine has been completed a manual quality control routine is done using hillshades, cross-sections, and profiles within the Terrasolid software suite. After this QC step, a peer review and supervisor manual inspection is completed on a percentage of the classified tiles based on the project size and variability of the terrain. After the ground classification corrections were completed, the dataset was processed through a water classification routine that utilizes breaklines compiled by Dewberry to automatically classify hydrographic features.  The water classification routine selects ground points within the breakline polygons and automatically classifies them as class 9, water. During this water classification routine, points which are in close proximity (2 ft) to the hydrographic features are moved to class 10, an ignored ground. In addition to classes 1, 2, 8, 9, and 10, the project allows for a Class 7, noise points. This class was only used if needed when points could manually be identified as low/high points. Dewberry also used Class 11 - Withheld points. The fully classified dataset is then processed through Dewberry's comprehensive quality control program.  The data was classified as follows: Class 1 = Unclassified.  This class includes vegetation, buildings, noise etc. Class 2 = Ground Class 7= Noise Class 8= Model Key Points Class 9 = Water Class 10= Ignored Ground Class 11= Withheld  The LAS header information was verified to contain the following: Class (Integer) GPS Week Time (0.0001 seconds) Easting (0.01 ft) Northing (0.01 ft) Elevation (0.01 ft) Echo Number (Integer 1 to 4) Echo (Integer 1 to 4) Intensity (8 bit integer) Flight Line (Integer) Scan Angle (Integer degree)</procdesc>         <srcused>Processed Lidar datasets in LAS 1.2 format</srcused>         <procdate>201109</procdate>         <srcprod>Finalized LiDAR dataset using Orthometric Heights.</srcprod>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntperp>               <cntper>Keith Patterson</cntper>               <cntorg>Dewberry - Geospatial Services Group</cntorg>             </cntperp>             <cntpos>Project Manager</cntpos>             <cntaddr>               <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>               <address>1000 N.

The breaklines are collected directly into an ArcGIS file geodatabase to ensure correct topology.  The LiDARgrammetry was performed under the direct supervision of an ASPRS Certified Photogrammetrist.  The breaklines were  stereo-compiled  in accordance with the Data Dictionary.    The data dictionary defines Tidal Waters as the land and water interface at the time of LiDAR acquisition of tidally influenced bodies of water.  There is no minimum area requirement.  Tidal variations over the course of a collection or between different collections will result in discontinuities along shorelines.  This is considered normal and these \"anomalies\" should be retained.  Variations in water surface elevation resulting in tidal variations during a collection should NOT be removed or adjusted, as this would require either the removal of valid, measured ground points or the introduction of unmeasured ground into the DEM.  The USGS priority is on the ground surface, and accepts there may be occasional, unavoidable irregularities in water surface.  Breaklines must be captured at or just below the elevations of the immediately surrounding terain.  Under no circumstances should a feature be elevated above the surrounding LiDAR points.  If it can be reasonably determined where the edge of water most probably falls, beneath the dock or pier, then the edge of water will be collected at the elevation of the water where it can be directly measured. If there is a clearly-indicated headwall or bulkhead adjacent to the dock or pier and it is evident that the waterline is most probably adjacent to the headwall or bulkhead, then the water line will follow the headwall or bulkhead at the elevation of the water where it can be directly measured. If there is no clear indication of the location of the waters edge beneath the dock or pier, then the edge of water will follow the outer edge of the dock or pier as it is adjacent to the water, at the measured elevation of the water.  Breaklines shall snap and merge seamlessly with linear hydrographic features.</procdesc>         <srcused>Lidar Intensity Stereopairs</srcused>         <procdate>201109</procdate>         <srcprod>3D breaklines</srcprod>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntperp>               <cntper>Keith Patterson</cntper>               <cntorg>Dewberry - Geospatial Services Group</cntorg>             </cntperp>             <cntpos>Project Manager</cntpos>             <cntaddr>               <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>               <address>1000 N.
