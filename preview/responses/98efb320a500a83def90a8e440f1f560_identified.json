With an approximate radius for these planets set at 50m, the required density to maintain Earth-like surface gravity is calculated and compared to known super-dense structures such as white-dwarfs. The stability of such a planet is then discussed and it is concluded that it would likely explode due to the severe imbalance of gravitational pressure to degeneracy and coulomb pressures.</description>            <dc:creator>Claire Sullivan</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Jonathan Sallabank</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Adam Higgins</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Alex Foden</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-12</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-12</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>13</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>          </item>    <item rdf:about=\"https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/718\">        <title>A4_2 Vaporising Earth</title>    <link>https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/718</link>            <description>In this paper we explore the energies needed to completely vaporise the Earth. Taking into account the relative abundances of elements in the Earth and their latent heats of fusion and vaporisation, it is found that 6.41 x 1031J of energy (the equivalent of 7.82 x 1017kg of fissionable uranium) is needed to achieve this. It is found that this is not possible with modern day technologies, but may be possible in the future.</description>            <dc:creator>Adam Higgins</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Alex Foden</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Jonathan Sallabank</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Claire Sullivan</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-14</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-14</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>13</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>          </item>    <item rdf:about=\"https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/734\">        <title>P4_2 Tidal forces in the solar system</title>    <link>https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/734</link>            <description>&lt;p align=&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;This article investigates the tidal accelerations exerted by planets on orbiting moons.

It states that an hour on a planet orbiting a supermassive back hole is equivalent to 7 years passing on Earth. Calculations made state that the planet is inside the minimum orbit for a planet around a black hole and would thus fall with a ballistic trajectory into the centre.However, a static system was assumed, so with an optically spinning black hole the planet may be in a stable orbit. A spacecraft orbiting at a distance unaffected by time dilation is also considered and found to be largely implausible.</description>            <dc:creator>Claire Sullivan</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Jonathan Sallabank</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Alex Foden</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Adam Higgins</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-11</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-11</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>13</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>          </item>    <item rdf:about=\"https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/788\">        <title>P5_6 A Hovering 747</title>    <link>https://physics.le.ac.uk/journals/index.php/pst/article/view/788</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halicarnassus&lt;/em&gt; is a highly modified 747, capable of hovering, featured in Matthew Reilly\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds novel, &lt;em&gt;Seven Ancient Wonders&lt;/em&gt;.

It would take the force of 29 million people crunching in unison to generate the required 2.45x10^-2 N to tip over the box.</description>            <dc:creator>Katie Herlingshaw</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Duleep Vasudevan</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Thomas Griffiths</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Mark Phillips</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-14</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-14</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>13</prism:volume>   <prism:number>1</prism:number>          </item>  </rdf:RDF> ",
