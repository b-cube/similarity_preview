The sample covers both northern and southern towns and cities and permits examination of female occupations and labor force participation rates. Information on individuals includes occupation, city of residence, age, sex, race, dollar value of real and personal property owned, whether American or foreign born, and literacy. The second release of this collection adds nine constructed variables, including several weight variables, collapsed occupation, ICPSR state code, region, and unique internal family and household identifier numbers.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1860\" cycle=\"P1\">1860</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1986\" cycle=\"P1\">1986</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>All individuals living in towns with populations of 3,000 or more who were enumerated in the 1860 Census of Population Manuscript Schedules.</universe>                      <dataKind>census/enumeration data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Stratified random sample.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          United States Bureau of the Census 1860 Manuscript Schedules             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
