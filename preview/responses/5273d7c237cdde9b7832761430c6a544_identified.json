This tropical estuarine region has faced significant changes in the last few decades due to diverse pressures from various sectors, mainly of anthropogenic origin. Spatial and temporal changes in the LU/LC classes have been evaluated using satellite datasets from Landsat MSS, TM and IRS-LISS III for the years 1973, 1989, 2001 and 2011. Considering a spectrally heterogeneous landscape of the region, the LU/LC changes are identified by using principal component analysis (PCA) as a pre-classification step, followed by the implementation of a combination of supervised and unsupervised classification called hybrid classification. The application of PCA has proved to be suitable to successfully identify discrete land surface classes for this study area. An overall accuracy of 95.56 % (kappa=0.9556), 92.93 % (kappa=0.92), 84.64 % (kappa=0.85) and 86.36 % (kappa=0.85) has been obtained for the year 2011, 2001, 1989 and 1973, respectively. The study reveals a gradual increase in built-up area due to urbanization corresponding to a decrease in agricultural land and a considerable loss in beach area. Changes in the mangroves are also assessed within this extent as Goa has significant pockets of mangroves which are located mainly along the estuarine complexes of Mandovi and Zuari (along with the Cumbarjua canal complex). The results highlight an increase in mangrove coverage within the study extent by 1,585.8 ha from 1973 to 2011. The mangrove areal extent along Mandovi has increased from 149.45 to 1,059.77 ha and from 142.95 to 676.12 ha along Zuari (including Cumbarjua canal). Increasing awareness and the steps taken by the forest department to provide suitable environment for the growth of mangroves are the main reasons for this increment</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4686\">     <title>Controls on the distribution and fractionation of yttrium and rare earth elements in core sediments from the Mandovi estuary, western India</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4686</link>     <description>Title: Controls on the distribution and fractionation of yttrium and rare earth elements in core sediments from the Mandovi estuary, western India &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Prajith, A.; Rao, V.P.; Kessarkar, P.M. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Mineralogy, major elements (Fe, Mn and Al), rare earths and yttrium (REY) of bulk sediments were analyzed in four gravity cores recovered along the main channel of the Mandovi estuary, western India, to determine the sources and controls on REY distribution. The accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) ages of total organic carbon indicated modern age for the sediments of the upper estuary and, maximum mean ages of 1588 years AD and 539 years AD for the bottom sediments of the cores in the lower estuary and bay, respectively. The sediments of the upper/middle estuary showed abundant hematite, magnetite and goethite and high Fe, Mn, total-REE (\\ufffd\\ufffdREE) and Y, while those in the lower estuary/bay showed abundant silicate minerals and relatively low Fe, Mn, \\ufffd\\ufffdREE and Y. \\ufffd\\ufffdREE showed significant correlation with clay and silt fractions and Y, Al and organic carbon (OC) content of the sediments. The light to heavy REE ratios (LREE/HREE) of sediments were lower than in Post-Archean Australian Shale (PAAS). The PAAS-normalized rare earths and yttrium (REY; Y inserted between Dy and Ho) patterns of sediments showed middle REE (MREE)- and HREE-enrichment with positive Eu anomaly (Eu/Eu\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) and variable Ce anomaly (Ce/Ce\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). The REY of sediments is primarily controlled by its texture and REE of source sediment, which is ore material-dominated in the upper/middle estuary and silicate material-dominated in the lower estuary/bay. Low LREE/HREE ratios suggest that very fine-grained sediments were carried away from the estuary because of high-energy conditions. Fractionations of REY (Y/Ho, Sm/Nd, Ce/Ce\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and Eu/Eu\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) are controlled by different mechanisms. High Y/Ho ratios in clayey silts are due to redistribution of Y and Ho by adsorption onto organic-rich, clays. Variations in Sm/Nd ratios are similar to that of Eu/Eu\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in cores from the lower estuary/bay and are controlled by mineral constituents of the sediments. Positive Ce and Eu anomalies are inherited from ore material, and ore material and source rocks, respectively. Negative Ce anomaly is related to source rock material and influenced by lanthanum enrichment at certain sediment intervals</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4685\">     <title>Geochemical characterization of the Krishna\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGodavari and Mahanadi offshore basin (Bay of Bengal) sediments: A comparative study of provenance</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4685</link>     <description>Title: Geochemical characterization of the Krishna\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGodavari and Mahanadi offshore basin (Bay of Bengal) sediments: A comparative study of provenance &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Mazumdar, A.; Kocherla, M.; Carvalho, M.A.; Peketi, A.; Joshi, R.K.; Mahalaxmi, P.; Joao, H.M.; Jisha, R. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The Krishna\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGodavari and Mahanadi rivers drain the east coast of India and deposit the sediment load into the Krishna\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGodavari and Mahanadi offshore basins along the western margin of the Bay of Bengal. Here we report the bulk major, trace and rare earth element (REE) compositions and clay mineralogy of the fine grained sediments from the cores collected on board JOIDES Resolution and Marion Dufresne as part of India's gas hydrate program. The geochemical composition and clay mineralogy of sediments have been used to constrain the provenance. The results show that the Mahanadi sediments are primarily derived from the felsic rocks belonging to the late Archean-early Proterozoic peninsular gneissic complexes, whereas the Krishna\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGodavari sediments are derived from the mixing of late Archean-early Proterozoic peninsular gneissic complexes and Late Cretaceous Deccan basalt sources. This paper presents the first comparative analysis of provenance of the Krishna\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGodavari (K\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdG) and Mahanadi offshore basin sediments. The sediment geochemistry enables distinction of specific contributing sources, which could potentially be related to modern climatic and geomorphological conditions. The present study could also provide the opportunity for high resolution paleoclimatic analysis using clay mineralogical contents and weathering indices</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4682\">     <title>A simple device for subsectioning aqueous sediments from the box or spade corer</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4682</link>     <description>Title: A simple device for subsectioning aqueous sediments from the box or spade corer &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Valsangkar, A.B. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: A simple device has been developed to accomplish the requirement of precise thin subsections of the aqueous sediments at ease from the box or spade subcores.
