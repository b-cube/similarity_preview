The study aggregates data, produced by the United  Nations, the World Bank, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation  and Development. Seventy lesser-developed countries located in  Subsaharan Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean,  Asia, and southern Europe are included. These countries were selected  on the basis of data availability. The variables provide information  on exports as a proportion of Gross National Product (GNP), export  concentration, commodity concentration, trade composition, terms of  trade, types of investment, aid concentration, debt service, arms  transfers, educational indicators, social welfare indicators, taxes,  unemployment, security measures, GNP indicators, index of national resource endowment, and population.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1970\" cycle=\"P1\">1970</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1977\" cycle=\"P1\">1977</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Africa</geogCover>             <geogCover>Asia</geogCover>             <geogCover>Europe</geogCover>             <geogCover>Latin America</geogCover>             <geogCover>Middle East</geogCover>             <geogCover>West Indies</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Lesser-developed countries.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Seventy countries from Subsaharan Africa, the Middle East,  Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, and southern Europe were selected on the basis of data availability.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          United Nations, World Bank, and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 The codebook is provided by ICPSR as a Portable  Document Format (PDF) file.
