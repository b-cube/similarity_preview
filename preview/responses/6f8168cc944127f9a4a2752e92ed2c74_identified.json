If we could simply eliminate health insurance--public and private --as well as all cross-subsidization within health care providers, we could dramatically reduce health care costs, perhaps to near zero for a large segment of the population. For those who believe that the central health policy issue facing the United States is excessive health care expenditures this is a very important point, which I expect to see frequently in health policy discussions here in the next few years.&lt;br&gt; [...] </content> </entry>  <entry xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom'>   <link rel='alternate' href='https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk:443/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=AAHPN;a1ecfb39.1501' title='Re: comment re Chinitz &amp; Rodwin '/>   <author>      <name>Uwe E.
