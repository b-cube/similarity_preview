Monthly precipitation and monthly mean temperature data (1 km resolution) were downloaded from the Worldclim website. Each of these global datasets was masked to the ESA and SSA boundaries and converted from integer to float. Several different equations based on Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s (2001) Worldwide Bioclimate Classification System, were used to model the Worldclim data. ESA Bioclimate Zone Data In the ESA, five different bioclimate zones were modeled from the Worldclim data. Two formula were used to model tropical bioclimate zones: Ombrothermic Index (Io) and Ombrothermic Index of driest month within the driest quarter of the year (Iod2). The Io grid was produced from total annual precipitation and total annual temperature using the following formula: Io = Pp/ (Tp/100) x 12 Where: Pp (Total Annual Precipitation) = sum of the total precipitation of each month of the year, in mm Tp (Total Annual Temperature) = sum of the mean temperature of each month of the year, in tenths of degrees. (The Worldclim temperature data is multiplied by 10 (e.g. 20 degrees Celsius is 200), therefore it was necessary to divide the Tp value by 100.) Tp is multiplied by 12 months. Tropical bioclimate zones were identified by reclassifying the Io grid: Io values &lt; 0.1 represented Tropical Hyperdesertic; Io values 0.1-1.0 represented Tropical Desertic; Io values from 1.0-3.6 represented Tropical Xeric; and Io values &gt;= 3.6 represented either Tropical Pluvial or Tropical Pluvialseasonal. The Iod2 grid, used to differentiate between Tropical Pluvial and Tropical Pluvialseasonal zones, was produced from monthly total precipitation and monthly mean temperature data using the following formula: Iod2 = Ppd2/ (Tpd2/100) *12 Where: Ppd2 = Total Precipitation of Driest Bimonth or Quarter (sum of the total precipitation from the driest two or three months) Tpd2 = Total Temperature of the Driest Bimonth or Quarter (sum of the mean temperature from the same two or three months as Ppd2) In the ESA, the study area was split into two parts at the equator, and different months were used to derive a north and south Iod2 grid. For north of the equator, an Iod2 grid was derived using total precipitation and mean temperature from February, March and April. For south of the equator, an Iod2 grid was derived using total monthly precipitation and mean monthly temperature from July and August. The Andes Mountains were best represented in the southern Iod2 grid, so the Andes Mountain area north to 5 degrees latitude was masked from the southern Iod2 grid. These three grids were then merged to form a single Iod2 grid for the entire ESA. Tropical Pluvial and Tropical Pluvialseasonal zones were identified by reclassifying the final Iod2 grid: Iod2 values &gt;2.5 represented Tropical Pluvial and Iod2 values &lt;=2.5 represented Tropical Pluvialseasonal. An ESA bioclimate grid was produced by combining the Io and Iod2 grids (filename:esa_genbioc_s). The above Io and Iod2 formula differ slightly from those presented by Rivas-Martinez et. al. (2001). The denominator is multiplied by 12, instead of 10, because almost all of the ESA occurred within the tropics with no months of mean temperature below 0 degrees Celsius. Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s formula excludes cold months , multiplying the denominator by 10, and is best used for deriving bioclimate zones in Temperate areas. Unfortunately, during the development of the ESA bioclimate zone grid it became apparent that the modeled data was not very accurate. The Worldclim precipitation and temperature data is good, but a much more detailed development of the Iod2 grid is needed to accurately reflect the boundaries of Tropical Pluvial and Tropical Pluvialseasonal bioclimate zones. The low density of weather stations throughout much of the ESA may make it impossible to entirely model a good representative bioclimate zone map for this area (see Appendix V for the distribution of climate stations with precipitation and mean temperature data). In future projects, the ESA study area could be divided up into smaller sections based on variation in \"driest months\" and separate Iod2 grids produced for each area, then mosaiced together to try and improve the modeled data (it was not possible in this project due to time constraints). Originally, bioclimate zones south of 30 degrees south in the ESA were going to be further defined using a Continentality Index (they are incorrectly identified in the ESA bioclimate grid as Tropical Pluvial or Tropical Pluvialseasonal), but when it became apparent that the bioclimate data was not very accurate they were not modeled. SSA Bioclimate Zone Data In the SSA, ten bioclimate zones were produced from a combination of modeled Worldclim data and Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s bioclimate map of South America (1995) (see Appendix III). Two Io grids were modeled for the SSA: one multiplied the denominator by 10 and one by 12. The (10) Io grid was used to model Tropical bioclimate zones in the north of the SSA following the method outlined above, except that in the ESA Tropical Desertic and Tropical Hyperdesertic were modeled as separate classes, in the SSA and final South America bioclimate grid they were joined into one class (4000): Io values from &lt;0.1-1.0 represented Tropical Desertic/Tropical Hyperdesertic). In the SSA, an Iod2 grid was modeled from July and August data (and 10 as the denominator) and used to distinguish between Tropical Pluvial and Tropical Pluvialseasonal bioclimate zones. The resultant Tropical bioclimate zones in the SSA correlated fairly well with Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s map (1995). The (12) Io grid and a Continentality Index (Ic) grid were used to model Temperate bioclimate zones. Ic is the number expressing the range between the average temperatures of the warmest (January) and coldest (July) months of the year. Areas with Ic values &lt;=11 and Io values &gt;3.6 represented Temperate Hyperoceanic/Temperate Oceanic. Areas with Ic values &gt;=7 and Io values &lt;=3.6 represented Temperate Xeric. Based on a visual comparison of the modeled data with Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s map (1995) the Temperate Hyperoceanic/Temperate Oceanic zone on the western coast appeared to be well modeled. The Temperate Hyperoceanic zone modeled in the Parana extended too far to the south and not far enough to the north, while the Temperate Xeric zone was not extensive enough in any direction. Based on recommendations from local ecologists the Low Monte ecoregion was used as the boundary for Temperate Xeric and it effectively clipped the southern extent of the Temperate Hyperoceanic/Temperate Oceanic zone. Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s map (1995) was used to extend the northern boundary of the Temperate Hyperoceanic/Temperate Oceanic zone north to around 30 degrees south. The (12) Io grid and Ic grid were also used to model Mediterranean bioclimate zones in southern South America: Ic values &lt;=21 and Io values &gt; 2.0 represented Mediterranean Pluvialseasonal Oceanic; Ic values &lt;=21 and Io values 1.0-2.0 represented Mediterranean Xeric Oceanic; and Ic values &lt;=21 and Io values &lt;1.0 represented Mediterranean Desertic Oceanic/Mediterranean Hyperdesertic oceanic. The boundary between Tropical bioclimate zones and the northern extent of all three Mediterranean bioclimate zones were not well defined, so Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s map (1995) was used to on-screen digitize these boundaries. The Boreal Hyperoceanic bioclimate zone could not successfully be modeled from the Worldclim data (it could not be differentiated from Temperate HyperOceanic), so it was on-screen digitized based on Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s map (1995). Each bioclimate zone was modeled across the entire SSA using the Io, Iod2 and Ic grid data, and as note above, modified using Rivas-Martinez et. al's map. The specific extent of each bioclimate zone was then masked from the various grids and mosaiced together to form a final SSA bioclimate grid (filename: ssa_genbioc_s). The ESA and SSA general bioclimate grids were mosaiced into a final South America general bioclimate grid (filename: sa_genbioc_s). The Temperate Hyperoceanic/Temperate Oceanic bioclimate zone in the southern ESA, which was never produced in the original analysis, was on-screen digitized using Rivas-Martinez et. al.'s bioclimate map (1995). </procdesc> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Metadata imported.</procdesc> <procdate>20100903</procdate> <proctime>06500300</proctime> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Raster</direct> <rastinfo> <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype> <rowcount>16996</rowcount> <colcount>29014</colcount> <vrtcount>1</vrtcount> </rastinfo> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres>0.004167</latres> <longres>0.004167</longres> <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit> </geograph> <geodetic> <horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn> <ellips>WGS_1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257224</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>sa_bioclim_450m_dd84.img.vat</enttypl> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>ObjectID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>1</edomv> <edomvd>Tropical Pluvial</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>2</edomv> <edomvd>Tropical Pluvialseasonal</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>3</edomv> <edomvd>Tropical Xeric</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>4</edomv> <edomvd>Tropical Desertic/Tropical Hyperdesertic</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>5</edomv> <edomvd>Mediterranean Pluvialseasonal Oceanic</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>6</edomv> <edomvd>Mediterranean Xeric Oceanic</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>7</edomv> <edomvd>Mediterranean Desertic Oceanic/Mediterranean Hyperdesertic Oceanic</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>8</edomv> <edomvd>Temperate Hyperoceanic/Temperate Oceanic</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>9</edomv> <edomvd>Temperate Xeric</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>10</edomv> <edomvd>Boreal Hyperoceanic</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Value</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Count</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Red</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Green</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Blue</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Opacity</attrlabl> </attr> </detailed> </eainfo> <distinfo> <resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc> <stdorder> <digform> <digtinfo> <transize>0.000</transize> </digtinfo> </digform> </stdorder> </distinfo> <metainfo> <metd>20100903</metd> <metc> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Roger Sayre</cntper> <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, Geographic Analysis and Monitoring Program</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>Senior Scientist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>physical address</addrtype> <address>519 National Center</address> <city>Reston</city> <state>VA</state> <postal>20192</postal> <country>U.S.A.</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(703) 648-4529</cntvoice> <cntemail>rsayre@usgs.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </metc> <metstdn>FGDC Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata</metstdn> <metstdv>FGDC-STD-001-1998</metstdv> <mettc>local time</mettc> <metextns> <onlink>&lt;http://www.esri.com/metadata/esriprof80.html&gt;</onlink> <metprof>ESRI Metadata Profile</metprof> </metextns> </metainfo> </metadata> ",
