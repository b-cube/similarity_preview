On NOAA's Nautical Chart 81004, it is identified by a single sounding of 5 fm (9 m). It is smaller than indicated on the chart and its true center is approximately 1 km southeast of the center of the charted bank. It was mapped in September 2003 using single-beam sonar and an underwater video camera during the NOAA MARAMP cruise. Encrusting and fleshy algae, hard and soft corals, and sand were seen on hard substrate ridges. Optical validation data were collected using the Tethered Optical Assessment Device (TOAD), a sled equipped with underwater video camera and lights. These data are used to provide ground-truth validation for benthic habitat maps based on multibeam echosounder surveys. Camera sled deployments were conducted at night, usually between 1800 and midnight. The duration of each tow varied but averaged about 40 minutes of bottom time at a given location. The camera sled was deployed from the port J-frame mounted amidships on the NOAA Ship Oscar Elton Sette. At each station the ship was positioned with the wind on the port side and drifted downwind; occasional light turns were applied to the ship's screws if necessary to reduce the ship's motion.  The TOAD was lowered slowly to the bottom by the deck crew using a capstan.  The operator monitored a live video feed from the camera and began recording data on a video tape recorder.  When the camera reached bottom the deck crew was notified by radio to stop lowering.  The operator continued to monitor the vehicle and provided commands to raise or lower it to keep the camera just above the bottom. Equipment Description: The TOAD was deployed from the lower arm of the vessel's port side J-frame.   The TOAD is a camera sled based on the Guildline MiniBat model 8820 tow body.  The frame has been extensively modified from its original configuration and was equipped with an ROS model 54-00100-13 color underwater video camera as the primary data collection instrument. The ROS camera was mounted to point at approximately a 45 degree angle toward the seafloor. A Deep Sea Power and Light model 2050 MultiSeaCam low-light color video camera was also mounted on the sled and aimed straight ahead. The signal from this camera was fed to a second video monitor to provide warning of underwater obstructions the sled might be headed for. Illumination was provided by two 500 W DeepSea Power &amp; Light Multi-SeaLite model 1050 underwater lights mounted on the original sled frame. The lights were located near the base and each side of the sled to provide the maximum possible horizontal distance from the ROS camera. Cable between the sled and the surface consisted of a underwater electrical cable (cable 2, black in color) with an internal kevlar strength member to support the sled frame.  The cable was led from the camera sled over a 22-inch diameter sheave hung from the J-frame, and from there around a gypsy head mounted on the alternate CTD winch, amidships on the vessel's port side. All TOAD surface components were located in the Dry Lab in an equipment rack on the after bulkhead. Name &amp; address of person collecting data: John Rooney NOAA IRC NMFS/PIFSC/CRED 1845 WASP Blvd., Building 176 Honolulu, HI 96818 Data Files: Video data were recorded on a video tape recorder.  The position of the camera sled was recorded in WGS-84 using Guildline MiniBat In-Tow data acquisition software and a data feed from a shipboard Northstar Chartplotter. File naming convention: Each tow is given a name consisting of a 3-letter designator for the island area followed by a two-digit year and a three-digit tow number, which increments by one for each new tow around that island.  For Arakane Bank the designator is \"ARA. \"During OES0307 (NOAA Ship Oscar Elton Sette's 7th cruise in calendar year 2003) the consecutive numbers started at ARA03000. Video tape labels, the navigation files (*.glo) and paper log forms are annotated with the tow name and number, e.g., ARA03002. If the navigation file is edited during processing the file name has a suffix 'a' added.  For example, for a navigation data file named \"ARA03002a.glo,\" the 'a' would indicate that metadata were extracted from the navigation data and recorded to a file with the same name as the navigation file except that a file type of '.met' was appended; for example, 'ARA03002a.glo.met. Time Correlation: All times are based on UTC.  Two clocks were manually synchronized prior to starting data collection; the clock in the video character generator that was used to annotate the video tape, and the clock in the TOAD data acquisition computer. These clocks were set to UTC at the beginning of each evening's operations.  Resource Description: Digital video imagery that is geo-referenced to navigation files.       </supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>             20030915           </caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>         ground condition       </current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>         Complete       </progress>    <update>         None planned       </update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>           142.75         </westbc>     <eastbc>           142.78         </eastbc>     <northbc>           15.64         </northbc>     <southbc>           15.62         </southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>           CoRIS Theme Thesaurus         </themekt>     <themekey>           EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Aquatic Habitat &gt; Benthic Habitat         </themekey>     <themekey>           EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef Monitoring and Assessment &gt; Mapping         </themekey>     <themekey>           EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef Monitoring and Assessment &gt; Photographic Analysis &gt; Videography         </themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>           CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus         </themekt>     <themekey>           Visual Images &gt; Habitats         </themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>           None         </themekt>     <themekey>           Tethered Optical Assessment Device (TOAD)         </themekey>     <themekey>           Underwater video         </themekey>     <themekey>           OES0307         </themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>           ISO 19115 Topic Category         </themekt>     <themekey>           environment         </themekey>     <themekey>           biota         </themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>           CoRIS Place Thesaurus         </placekt>     <placekey>           OCEAN BASIN &gt; Pacific Ocean &gt; Western Pacific Ocean &gt; Arakane Reef &gt; Arakane Reef (15N141E0001)         </placekey>     <placekey>           COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; Northern Mariana Islands &gt; Northern Mariana Islands &gt; Arakane Reef (15N141E0001)         </placekey>     <placekey>           OCEAN BASIN &gt; Pacific Ocean &gt; Western Pacific Ocean &gt; Mariana Archipelago &gt; Northern Mariana Islands ( CNMI ) (18N146E0000)         </placekey>     <placekey>           COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; Northern Mariana Islands &gt; Northern Mariana Islands &gt; Northern Mariana Islands ( CNMI ) (18N146E0000)         </placekey>    </place>    <place>     <placekt>           None         </placekt>     <placekey>           Arakane Bank         </placekey>    </place>    <place>     <placekt>           CoRIS Region         </placekt>     <placekey>           CNMI         </placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>       None     </accconst>   <useconst>       Please acknowledge the NOAA Coral Reef Ecosystem Division, Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center as the source of this information.     </useconst>   <ptcontac>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>             Pacific Islands Benthic Habitat Mapping Center (PIBHMC), Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)           </cntorg>      <cntper>             John Rooney           </cntper>     </cntorgp>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>             mailing and physical address           </addrtype>      <address>NOAA IRC</address>      <address>NMFS/PIFSC/CRED</address>      <address>1845 WASP Blvd., Building 176</address>      <city>             Honolulu           </city>      <state>             HI           </state>      <postal>96818</postal>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>808 725-5360</cntvoice>     <cntfax>808 725-5429</cntfax>     <cntemail>           nmfs.pic.credinfo@noaa.gov         </cntemail>     <cntinst>           e-mail preferred         </cntinst>    </cntinfo>   </ptcontac>   <datacred>       Pacific Islands Benthic Habitat Mapping Center, Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), NOAA     </datacred>   <secinfo>    <secsys>         Not applicable       </secsys>    <secclass>         Unclassified       </secclass>    <sechandl>         Not applicable       </sechandl>   </secinfo>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>   <logic>       Unspecified     </logic>   <complete>       Complete     </complete>   <posacc>    <horizpa>     <horizpar>           The horizontal position accuracy for the camera sled position is estimated at plus or minus 100 meters.  There are three primary sources of this error.  The ship's positioning is based on GPS SPS, often called standalone or non-differential GPS positioning.  SPS has a measured accuracy of under 5 meters.  The position of the GPS antenna is used; no attempt is made to translocate this position to that of the tow block from which the camera is deployed. The difference between the tow block and the antenna is about 14 meters. The largest source of error is uncertainty associated with the sled's position relative to the tow block.         </horizpar>    </horizpa>   </posacc>   <lineage>    <procstep>     <procdesc>           After a tow was completed the video tape data and still photographs were reviewed by spot-checking to verify that data were recorded. Navigation data were copied from the acquisition computer to the data archive.  A metadata extractor (gloMeta.py, version 9/28/04) was run to summarize the navigation data and test for errors.  If errors were detected they were corrected or flagged as appropriate and a new data file was made.  This file's header was updated to document what type of processing occurred.  A metadata file was recorded in the data archive in the same location as the navigation data.  Processed navigation data were then read into ArcView 3.2 shapefiles using an Avenue script named `toadimport.playback.ave', version 9/25/01, written by Ronald Hoeke.         </procdesc>     <procdate>           20051017         </procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <distinfo>   <distrib>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>             Pacific Islands Benthic Habitat Mapping Center (PIBHMC), Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)           </cntorg>      <cntper>             John Rooney           </cntper>     </cntorgp>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>             mailing and physical address           </addrtype>      <address>NOAA IRC</address>      <address>NMFS/PIFSC/CRED</address>      <address>1845 WASP Blvd., Building 176</address>      <city>             Honolulu           </city>      <state>             HI           </state>      <postal>96818</postal>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>808 725-5360</cntvoice>     <cntfax>808 725-5429</cntfax>     <cntemail>           nmfs.pic.credinfo@noaa.gov         </cntemail>     <cntinst>           e-mail preferred         </cntinst>    </cntinfo>   </distrib>   <resdesc>       Offline Data     </resdesc>   <distliab>       These data are not to be used for navigational purposes.
