An important and unique collection reflecting the lives, interests and work of the two authors, the Somerville &amp; Ross Papers consist largely of diaries, correspondence, working papers, and draft manuscripts relating to the authors    literary activities, personal interests and affairs.</p>  <p>  Of the literary papers can be found annotated, handwritten notes and manuscripts relating to numerous publications produced under the Somerville &amp; Ross name, including that of    T<title linktype=\"simple\">he Further Experiences of an Irish RM</title>    (1908), one of their best known works.  Other papers concern the unfinished novel,    <title linktype=\"simple\">A Man of the People</title>    (c 1897-99) and drafts of    <title linktype=\"simple\">Some Irish Yesterdays</title>    (1906),    <title linktype=\"simple\">Mount Music</title>    (1919),    <title linktype=\"simple\">The Big House of Inver</title>    (1925) and, Somerville's last book,    <title linktype=\"simple\">Maria and Some Other Dogs</title>   (published 1949). Working notes are also featured and these include an indexed notebook of Irish anecdotes and dialogue compiled by the two writers, c 1886-1945, and various notes on Irish political and cultural affairs, the suffragette movement and Irish agriculture, c 1910-32. </p>  <p>  Most notable amongst the personal papers are the extant diaries of both Somerville and Martin and comprehensive series of correspondence from the two writers with friends, relatives and other associates. Of particular significance are the letters between Martin and Lady Augusta Gregory, co-founder of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin, c 1889-1915, and with the artist, William Gorman Wills, c 1885-1890, and Somerville with her brother, Colonel John Somerville, c 1889-1948, and the English Composer and Feminist, Dame Ethel Smyth, c 1918-44. Other interesting items include three notebooks detailing spiritualist sances attended by Somerville, 1930-41, with messages apparently received from Violet Martin and other dead relatives and a number of original illustrations and drawings by Somerville, who, in addition to her literary success enjoyed a good degree of artistic success during her lifetime.    </p>  </scopecontent>  <custodhist>  <p>The collection was amassed during the lifetime of both writers, with the papers of Violet Martin passing to Edith Somerville on her death in 1915. The entire collection was then inherited by Sir Patrick Coghill, a nephew of Edith Somerville following her own death in 1949, before being dispersed at auction at Sotheby's in c 1968. Queen's University was the principal purchaser at the sale.</p>  </custodhist>  <appraisal>  <p>Comprehensive collection of literary and personal papers reflecting the lives and work of the popular Irish writers, Somerville and Ross.
