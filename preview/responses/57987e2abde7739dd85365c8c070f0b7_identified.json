Total phosphorus concentration data was gathered for the full duration of the project. Soluble reactive phosphorus, total oxidisable nitrogen and dissolved reactive silicon concentration was only gathered from Jan 2005 until Feb 2006.  Sampling interval varied throughout the monitoring period, from a minimum of two samples to day, to eight per day during storm events (with an average of three samples per day throughout the duration of the monitoring period).  Samples were taken from the main flow of the river using an automatic water sampler, and analysed using standard colorometric methods, at the CEH Dorset laboratories.

The dataset runs from the breeding season in 1993 to the end of the breeding season in 2014. The first egg dates are presented as the number days from the start date which was set as the 1st April each year. Because the breeding of greats tits and blue tits is influenced in large part by ambient temperature and the phenology of their main prey, the data were collected as a measure spring phenology. These data comprise part of a larger long-term study of the influence of habitat (extent, structure and composition) and landscape factors on abundance, distribution and breeding success of woodland birds in English lowland deciduous woodland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cambridgeshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monks Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brampton Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wennington Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>blue tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Parus major</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cyanistes caeruleus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>breeding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deciduous woodland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable land management (en)</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-10T12:37:18Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/85421fc3-d4bd-4841-a735-c6005f16edae\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: web map service of site locations</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/85421fc3-d4bd-4841-a735-c6005f16edae</link>     <description>This service displays the location of sites which have been monitored as part of the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS).

Data were collected from arable farms under the English Entry Level agri-environment Scheme (ELS) for two options: Nectar Flower Mixture option (NFM) and Wild Bird Seed Mixture (WBM). Surveys were carried out in 2007 and repeated in 2008. All data were collected using standardised protocols: butterfly and bumblebee counts were collected from transects in the NFM options during summer; flowering units were counted within quadrats along the same transects in summer; bird counts were made in winter within the whole WBM areas; seed resource was calculated for the WBM areas from seeds collected in quadrats along transects.  The dataset also contains results from farmer interviews. The interviews were designed to explore farmer attitudes towards, and history of, environmental management and their perceptions and understanding of the management requirements. Three measures of farmer attitude were then calculcated from their responses: experience (4-point scale), concerns (5-point scale) and motivation (3-point scale).  All data were collected as part of the FarmCAT project, the principal aim of which was to develop a holistic understanding of the social and ecological factors which lead to the successful delivery of agri-environmental schemes. This project was funded as part of the ESRC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter birds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bumblebees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>flowers</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>seeds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>agri-environment schemes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>AES</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nectar Flower Mixture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EF4</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wild Bird Seed Mixture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EF2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>environmental management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-06T15:36:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a384bdfb-0bf2-4c3e-80ab-e171f38d503d\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from transects within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, between 2010 and 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a384bdfb-0bf2-4c3e-80ab-e171f38d503d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, between 2010-2011. A long term landscape scale grassland restoration and re-creation project has been underway at the site since 2000). 200m long transects located in the centre of different grassland re-creation fields of different ages, arable land, chalk grassland fragments on slopes and on ancient burial mounds, and semi-improved pasture. Transects were surveyed on three occasions spread across the field season (June to September), and throughout the day and were selected ad-hoc for survey in order to minimise the effect that the time of year and day would have on results. During the survey, the transect was walked at a slow, steady pace allowing five minutes for each 20m section of transect and the number and species of Lepidoptera present 5m either side and ahead were recorded. If Lepidoptera were observed feeding, then the nectar plant species was also recorded. Habitat quality, defined in terms of vegetation characteristics and nectar resources, was quantified throughout each transect by sampling quadrats in each 20m segment of the transect. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae). The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the National Trust.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>day flying moths</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland restoration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wiltshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stonehenge</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-30T09:12:02Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from chalk grassland fragment boundaries within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, in 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera from chalk grassland fragments at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, in 2011. The landscape consists of small fragments of ancient chalk grassland on slopes and groups of burial mounds (barrows) which have retained many of the characteristic chalk grassland plant and butterfly species. Surveys were located at four of these chalk grassland fragments. At each chalk grassland fragment, four 20 m long survey boundaries, were set up on boundaries with adjacent land cover of either arable land or new grassland re-creation sown in the years 2009 or 2010. Control surveys were also carried out in areas of continuous habitat within the chalk grassland fragment and in the adjoining land cover type. Surveys of Lepidoptera behaviour were carried out from May to July between 10am and 4pm and effort was taken to survey the same site at different times of the day in order to minimise the effect of survey time on behaviour. Standing at the chalk grassland fragment edge the flight path of individual Lepidoptera was tracked in the survey area for up to three minutes. Measures of vegetation characteristics and nectar flower availability were recorded for each plot. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae).

The landscape consisted of a mosaic of chalk grassland fragments on ancient burial mounds (barrows) and slopes, grassland re-creation fields of different ages since sowing, semi-improved pasture, arable farmland and woodland. In one of the grassland re-creation fields, two large areas were mown and eight 20 m long survey boundaries were set up. Four of these were set up on the edge of one of two mown areas and four were set up in areas of continuous un-mown grass which had dummy 'boundaries' parallel to the mown boundaries. The survey was conducted from the survey boundary and the flight path of individual Lepidoptera was tracked in the area 10 m either side of the survey boundary. Each individual Lepidoptera flight path was surveyed for three minutes. Each boundary was surveyed for a total of 20 minutes on three occasions over a five week period. The sequence of boundaries surveyed was chosen randomly and equal survey effort was allocated to visually searching both sides of the boundary. The order and time of day for surveying each survey area was random so to spread surveys throughout the survey period and throughout the day. Measures of vegetation characteristics and nectar flower availability were recorded for survey areas. Recorded vegetation characteristics included vegetation height and density. Nectar flower availability was measured as the number of flowering units of nectar flowers and numbers of those in the Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Dipsacaceae families. The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the National Trust.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>day flying moths</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland restoration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wiltshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stonehenge</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-29T16:54:25Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/65400133-9cfb-4cf4-bffd-97f1c3752025\">     <title>Water temperatures for the period 1984 to 2007 at 35 sites on 21 UK rivers</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/65400133-9cfb-4cf4-bffd-97f1c3752025</link>     <description>Seasonal average water temperatures for some UK rivers, 1984 to 2007- data are derived from other CEH projects and collated here.

Treatments were elevated ozone (AOT40 (Accumulated Ozone Threshold exposure of 40 parts per billion) of 12.86 ppm h) or control conditions (AOT40 of 0.02 ppm h). Measurements were dry weight, with a cutting height of 7cm above soil level. The distribution of plant material within the canopy was determined by separating material growing in the upper canopy (&gt;14cm) from the canopy edge and the inner canopy for both species. The experiments were carried out in the CEH Bangor Air Pollution Facility. Work was funded by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology Integrating Fund Initiative. The observed decreases in photosynthetic efficiency and capacity in elevated ozone indicate that the ability of such ubiquitous vegetation to act as a sink for atmospheric carbon may be reduced in future climates.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dave Norris</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Solar Domes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Abergwyngregyn</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>solardome</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ozone</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>root</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>leaf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>competition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pollution &amp; Environmental Risk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-18T14:47:06Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/54d8a3f9-eafb-4aa3-ac6e-55b697d05fdd\">     <title>Trifolium and Lolium competition in ozone</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/54d8a3f9-eafb-4aa3-ac6e-55b697d05fdd</link>     <description>The data include biomass, visible leaf injury and senescence, and ACi (net CO2 assimilation rate, A, versus calculated substomatal CO2 concentration, Ci) curves to calculate the photosynthetic parameters Jmax (maximum rate of photosynthetic electron transport) and Vcmax (maximum rate of Rubisco carboxylase activity).

The fields were located at the Hillesden Estate in Buckinghamshire, UK, where a randomised block experiment had been implemented to examine the effects of converting differing proportions of arable land to wildlife habitat. The fields were planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) followed by break crops of either oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) or field beans (Vicia faba L.). Three treatments were applied at random: a control (\"business as usual\"), Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) treatment and ELS Extra treatment. The ELS treatment involved removing 1% of land to create wildlife habitats. The ELS Extra had a greater proportion of land removed (6%) and additional wildlife habitats included. The total yield of each crop was measured at the time of harvesting using a yield meter attached to the combine harvester. From these values, yield per hectare and the ratio of crop yield to regional average yield were calculated.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>OSR</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>field beans</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter wheat</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brassica napus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vicia faba</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Triticum aestivum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hillesden</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Buckinghamshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T10:48:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6bc0ccb4-63c8-4121-bc4b-3c479877cff9\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1998  mapped estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6bc0ccb4-63c8-4121-bc4b-3c479877cff9</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1998 in a vector format. The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 569 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths per 1km square for 7 different feature categories within 45 different land class types, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-28T11:50:23Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/59422890-c8d3-49b8-b17e-4f5062475140\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1998 estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/59422890-c8d3-49b8-b17e-4f5062475140</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1998.

Data includes the location within the UK, the length and width of the line transect on each site, and how long the transect has been monitored. The UKBMS started in 1976 with fewer than 50 sites. The number of sites monitored each year has increased to over a thousand since 2008. There is turnover in sites monitored each year and details of the first and last year in which each site was surveyed are given. The majority of site data is provided by recorders at the time a transect is created. The majority of these recorders are volunteers. The Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) collate the data and the UKBMS is funded by a consortium of organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-10-27T14:16:54Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
