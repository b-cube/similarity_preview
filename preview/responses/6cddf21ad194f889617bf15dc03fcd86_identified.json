The FSSI is a performance measure for the sustainability of 230 US fish stocks selected for their importance to commercial and recreational fisheries.  The FSSI will increase as stock status becomes known, overfishing has ended, and stocks increase to a level that provides maximum sustainable yield.  B/Bmsy is a measure of current stock biomass relative to the target biomass level (the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield, or MSY).  FSSI scores are updated quarterly and are available from 2005 to present.  Data are derived from data posted on the SIS database, hosted by the Office of Science and Technology. </abstract>       <purpose>To inform the public of the most recent stock status (overfishing, overfished, and approaching overfished, FSSI score, and B/Bmsy estimate).</purpose>       <notes/>       <supplemental-info/>       <is-display-xml-formats>N</is-display-xml-formats>       <data-status>In Work</data-status>       <fgdc-data-status>In Work</fgdc-data-status>       <org-id>1412</org-id>       <owner-org-name>NMFS Office Of Sustainable Fisheries</owner-org-name>       <owner-org-acro>OSF</owner-org-acro>       <catalog-control-state>9</catalog-control-state>       <parent-cat-id>12799</parent-cat-id>       <parent-cat-type-code>PRJ</parent-cat-type-code>       <parent-title>Domestic Fisheries Division</parent-title>       <created-by>Jackie Locks</created-by>       <created-by-pers-id>6820</created-by-pers-id>       <record-created>2012-08-15T12:58:25</record-created>       <record-last-modified>2013-12-19T10:23:47</record-last-modified>       <record-published>2013-12-19</record-published>       <publication-status>Public</publication-status>       <metadata-last-modification-date>2013-12-19</metadata-last-modification-date>       <metadata-next-review-date>2014-12-20</metadata-next-review-date>       <linking-share-level>Project</linking-share-level>    </common-information>    <physical-location>       <organization>NMFS Office Of Sustainable Fisheries</organization>       <city>Silver Spring</city>       <state-province>MD</state-province>       <country>USA</country>    </physical-location>    <project-info>       <project-type>Project</project-type>       <is-mandated>N</is-mandated>    </project-info>    <keywords>       <theme-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">Fisheries, MSA, stock status, overfishing, overfished, report to congress</keyword-list>       </theme-keywords>    </keywords>    <data-attributes/>    <support-roles>       <support-role ccid=\"161687\"                     type=\"\"                     last-modified=\"\"                     created=\"\"                     org=\"1412\"                     person=\"7597\"                     support-role=\"2660\">          <role>Point of Contact</role>          <role-definition>&lt;F1.9&gt; Primary data manager for the data set(s)</role-definition>          <from>2005</from>          <to-date/>          <person-contact-info>             <name>Tromble, Galen R</name>             <address-type>MAILING</address-type>             <street-address>1315 East West Hwy, SSMC3, Room 13459</street-address>             <city>Silver Spring</city>             <state-prov>MD</state-prov>             <zip>20910-3282</zip>             <country>USA</country>             <email>galen.tromble@noaa.gov</email>             <phone>301-427-8552</phone>             <fax>301-713-1193</fax>          </person-contact-info>          <org-contact-info>             <name>NMFS Office Of Sustainable Fisheries</name>             <street-address>1315 East-West Highway, 13th Floor</street-address>             <city>Silver Springs</city>             <state-prov>MD</state-prov>             <zip>20910</zip>             <country/>             <url/>             <business-hours/>          </org-contact-info>          <contact-instructions/>       </support-role>    </support-roles>    <geog-area ccid=\"155616\"               type=\"\"               last-modified=\"2013-08-14T10:38:40\"               created=\"2013-08-14T10:38:40\">       <description>US National, EEZ</description>       <west-bound/>       <east-bound/>       <south-bound/>       <north-bound/>    </geog-area>    <time-frames>       <currentness-reference/>    </time-frames>    <access-info/>    <urls/>    <activity-log/>    <issues/>    <data-quality/>    <lineage/>    <acronyms/>    <glossary-terms/>    <faqs/>    <downloads/>    <related-items>       <item cat-id=\"20499\" cat-type=\"DOC\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Annual Report to Congress</title>          <abstract>The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires that NOAA?s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) report annually to Congress and the eight Regional Fishery Management Councils on the status of fisheries (Sec. 304(e)(1)). This report fulfills that requirement. The information in this report is generated by the NMFS regional offices and science centers based on the most recent stock assessments as of December 31 each year.  Status determinations are made using the best available scientific information from assessments and status determination criteria specified in fishery management plans.   This report provides a \"snapshot\" in time of the status of U.S. fisheries at the end of each year, and highlights the progress that NOAA Fisheries, the regional fishery management councils, and our stakeholders have made to end overfishing and rebuild stocks.</abstract>       </item>       <item cat-id=\"12820\" cat-type=\"DS\" relation-type=\"HI\">          <title>Overfished history</title>          <abstract>These data inform the public of all stocks and stock complexes that have been overfished since 2000.

Stock status includes overfishing, overfished, and approaching overfished condition; for FSSI stocks B/Bmsy estimates and FSSI scor are also included.  Files are in PDF format and are posted quarterly on the Office of Sustainable Fisheries website.  The FSSI is a performance measure for the sustainability of 230 US fish stocks selected for their importance to commercial and recreational fisheries, and their ability to be assessed.  The FSSI will increase as stock status becomes known, overfishing has ended, and stocks increase to a level that provides maximum sustainable yield.  B/Bmsy is a measure of current stock biomass relative to the target biomass level (the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield, or MSY).  FSSI scores are updated quarterly and are available from 2005 to present.  Data are derived from data entered in the Species Informaiton System (SIS) database, maintained by the Office of Science and Technology.</abstract>       </item>    </related-items>    <fgdc-contacts>       <fgdc-contact role=\"Point of Contact\">          <contact-type>cntper</contact-type>          <contact-person-name>Tromble, Galen R</contact-person-name>          <contact-org-name>NMFS Office Of Sustainable Fisheries</contact-org-name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>1315 East West Hwy, SSMC3, Room 13459</street-address>          <city>Silver Spring</city>          <state-prov>MD</state-prov>          <zip>20910-3282</zip>          <country>USA</country>          <email>galen.tromble@noaa.gov</email>          <voice>301-427-8552</voice>          <fax>301-713-1193</fax>          <instructions>Email or Phone   </instructions>       </fgdc-contact>    </fgdc-contacts>    <fgdc-time-period>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate/>                <begtime/>                <enddate/>                <endtime/>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current/>       </timeperd>    </fgdc-time-period>    <publisher>       <person-contact-info>          <name>Spallone, Regina L</name>          <address-type>MAILING</address-type>          <street-address>1315 East West Hwy, SSMC3, Room 13462</street-address>          <city>Silver Spring</city>          <state-prov>MD</state-prov>          <zip>20910-3282</zip>          <country>USA</country>          <email>regina.l.spallone@noaa.gov</email>          <phone>301-427-8568</phone>          <fax>301-713-1193</fax>       </person-contact-info>    </publisher> </catalog-item> ",
