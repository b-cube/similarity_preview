The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey in each of those years, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as the estimated mean length of linear features (hedgerows, walls, fences, banks, grass strips and tree lines) per 1km square within 45 different Land Class types based on the ITE Land Classification.  The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedgerows</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-10T14:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a384bdfb-0bf2-4c3e-80ab-e171f38d503d\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from transects within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, between 2010 and 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a384bdfb-0bf2-4c3e-80ab-e171f38d503d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, between 2010-2011. A long term landscape scale grassland restoration and re-creation project has been underway at the site since 2000). 200m long transects located in the centre of different grassland re-creation fields of different ages, arable land, chalk grassland fragments on slopes and on ancient burial mounds, and semi-improved pasture. Transects were surveyed on three occasions spread across the field season (June to September), and throughout the day and were selected ad-hoc for survey in order to minimise the effect that the time of year and day would have on results. During the survey, the transect was walked at a slow, steady pace allowing five minutes for each 20m section of transect and the number and species of Lepidoptera present 5m either side and ahead were recorded. If Lepidoptera were observed feeding, then the nectar plant species was also recorded. Habitat quality, defined in terms of vegetation characteristics and nectar resources, was quantified throughout each transect by sampling quadrats in each 20m segment of the transect. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae). The data were collected as part of a PhD project funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the National Trust.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>day flying moths</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grassland restoration</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wiltshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Stonehenge</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-30T09:12:02Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641\">     <title>Lepidoptera distribution and behaviour data from chalk grassland fragment boundaries within the Stonehenge landscape, UK, in 2011</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/61561232-3307-470a-b8dc-a923b25e1641</link>     <description>This dataset consists of behaviour and distribution data of Lepidoptera from chalk grassland fragments at the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, UK, in 2011. The landscape consists of small fragments of ancient chalk grassland on slopes and groups of burial mounds (barrows) which have retained many of the characteristic chalk grassland plant and butterfly species. Surveys were located at four of these chalk grassland fragments. At each chalk grassland fragment, four 20 m long survey boundaries, were set up on boundaries with adjacent land cover of either arable land or new grassland re-creation sown in the years 2009 or 2010. Control surveys were also carried out in areas of continuous habitat within the chalk grassland fragment and in the adjoining land cover type. Surveys of Lepidoptera behaviour were carried out from May to July between 10am and 4pm and effort was taken to survey the same site at different times of the day in order to minimise the effect of survey time on behaviour. Standing at the chalk grassland fragment edge the flight path of individual Lepidoptera was tracked in the survey area for up to three minutes. Measures of vegetation characteristics and nectar flower availability were recorded for each plot. Vegetation characteristics were measured as vegetation height and density and the percentage cover of bare ground and dead vegetation. Nectar resources were measured in terms of the number and percentage coverage of flowering units, the total number of nectar flowering units and of relevant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae).

The data were collected as part of Countryside Survey, a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978 by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. In addition to habitat areas, vegetation species data, soil data, linear habitat data, and freshwater habitat data are also gathered by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Broad Habitats</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T11:26:03Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7e2981e7-bd4c-4992-b7b0-1b1253bfd20d\">     <title>Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1990,1998 and 2007</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7e2981e7-bd4c-4992-b7b0-1b1253bfd20d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of change data for areas of Broad Habitats across Great Britain between 1990 and 1998, between 1990 and 2007, and between 1998 and 2007.

Tick sampling data (91 files, each representing a day of sampling) indicate tick abundance (distinguishing larvae, nymphs, adult males and adult females), vegetation height, soil moisture, temperature and relative humidity.  Static risk map files indicate modeled tick abundance: 251 landcover files for the three sites, as well as 36 ArcView map files.  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  Many people take pleasure from activities in forests and wild lands in the UK and others are being encouraged to participate. Unfortunately, there are risks and one of the most insidious is the possibility (albeit tiny) of acquiring a disease from wild animals; for example, ticks can be vectors of the bacterial infection leading to Lyme Disease. Both diagnosis and treatment can be problematic so prevention of acquiring such disease is highly desirable.  Surprisingly little is known about how best to warn countryside users about the potential for disease without scaring them away or spoiling their enjoyment. Answering such questions was the goal of this project, and required the integration of a diverse set of scientific skills, and an understanding of the views of those who manage countryside, those who have contracted zoonotic diseases and those who access the land.  This project combined knowledge from three strands of work, namely risk assessment, risk perception and communication, and scenario analysis. The study sites were selected to provide a range of environmental conditions and countryside use. Peri-urban parkland, accessible lowland forest and heath and remote upland forest were chosen as represented by Richmond Park on the fringe of Greater London, the New Forest in Southern England, and Exmoor in South West England.  The following additional data from this same research project are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6892 (see online resources): Lyme disease risk perception data resulting from tick imagery vignette experiments, Lyme disease patient interviews and surveys, residents and countryside staff focus groups, forest manager interviews, and multiple scoring procedures of animal social representation; as well as Lyme and tick risk communication data resulting from interviews with organisations and content analysis of risk warning information leaflets,  Further documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal and the project's ESRC funding award web page (see online resources).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Rick Stuart</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Human health and safety</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rural Economy and Land Use Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Assessing and communicating animal disease risks for countryside users</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>health risks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>leisure time activities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>lyme disease</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>national parks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>nature reserves</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tourism</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>zoonotic diseases</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDS</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-25T13:14:24Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
