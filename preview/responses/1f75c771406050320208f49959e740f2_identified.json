We investigated the effect of placement on the ability of dogs to reach on-body interfaces with their snouts. In our pilot study, seven placements along the front legs, rib cage, hip and chest are tested with six dogs. The results showed that the front leg placements are reachable with the least amount of training and are also the most invariant to small changes in location. With training, the lower half of the rib cage area had the fastest access times across subjects. We hope that these results may be useful in mapping the constraint space of placements for snout interactions.

Britt; Oppong, Joseph; Hoffmann, Joseph; Larsen, Elizabeth K.; Pluscht, Patrick While education in ethics and the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is widely acknowledged as an essential component of graduate education, particularly in the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and math), little consensus exists on how best to accomplish this goal. Recent years have witnessed a turn toward the use of games in this context. Drawing from two NSF-funded grants (one completed and one on-going), this paper takes a critical look at the use of games in ethics and RCR education. It does so by: (a) setting the development of research and engineering ethics games in wider historical and theoretical contexts, which highlights their promise to solve important pedagogical problems; (b) reporting on some initial results from our own efforts to develop a game; and (c) reflecting on the challenges that arise in using games for ethics education. In our discussion of the challenges, we draw out lessons to improve this nascent approach to ethics education in the STEM disciplines .

The integration of BIM and Geographic Information System (GIS) can offer substantial benefits to manage the planning process during the design and construction stages. Currently, building (and geospatial) data are shared between BIM software tools through a common data format, such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). Because of the diversity and complexity of domain knowledge across BIM and GIS systems, however, these syntactic approaches are not capable of overcoming semantic heterogeneity. This study uses semantic web technology to ensure the highest level of interoperability between existing BIM and GIS tools. The proposed approach is composed of three main steps; ontology construction, semantic integration through interoperable data formats and standards, and query of heterogeneous information sources. Because no application ontology is available to encompass all IFC classes with different attributes, we first develop an IFC-compliant ontology describing the hierarchy structure of BIM objects. Then, we can translate the building's elements and GIS data into semantic web standard formats. Once the information has been gathered from different sources and transformed into an appropriate semantic web format, the SPARQL query language is used in the last step to retrieve this information from a dataset. The completeness of the methodology is validated through a case study and two use case examples. </description> <dc:date>2014-08-14T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Parvaresh Karan, Ebrahim</dc:creator> <dc:description>As Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications become more sophisticated and used within other knowledge domains, the limitations of existing data exchange and sharing methods become apparent.
