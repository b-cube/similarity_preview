(I understand what you mean there, but at frist glance, the example show reader, the one prior tot he XOP is \"more efficiently serializing\".

To avoid requiring that all SOAP senders understand the HTTP caching mechanism, we recommend that all the data required by a processor that wants to act as a local cache needs to be carried along with the message. This includes the complete request/reply as well as the time the original HTTP request has been sent and the time the HTTP response has been received.  8. How are error conditions handled?  For example, what to do in the case of an HTTP 404?   </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2004Sep/0000.html\">email</a>] </description>   <proposal>   </proposal>   <resolution> <pre> The XMLP WG decided to close issue 503 by taking no action, with the  following rationale:  point 7: The processing model does not mandate knowning the HTTP caching mechanism,  the use of the enclosed representation is application depend. It may be  used like a local HTTP cache, and the example in <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/CR-soap12-rep-20040826/#rep-http-headers\">4.3.3</a> is actually  defining an extension to allow the application to use the enclosed  resource representation as a local cache.  point 8: It is up to the application to decide if the complete HTTP transaction (in  that case, indicating that it resulted in a 404) is required, and it will  then use an extension to carry that, or if the header will not be added. </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2004Sep/0004.html\">email</a>]   </resolution> </issue>  <issue>   <issue-num>502</issue-num>   <title>i18n issues - URI handling   </title>   <locus>Representation</locus>   <requirement>n/a</requirement>   <priority>Design</priority>   <topic>meta</topic>   <status>Closed</status>   <Accepted />   <originator><a href=\"mailto:andrea.vine@sun.com\">Andrea Vine</a></originator>   <responsible></responsible>   <description>   <pre> 5. The spec refers to URIs in several places. It is defined in the XMLSchema to be of type anyURI, so we take this to mean the same thing as the XMLSchema type anyURI. This type is actually more like an IRI and we think it might be advisable to reference IRI somewhere.  There should also be test cases for IRIs.  For example (assuming the actual document is encoded in UTF-8), the following should be legal:  &lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap='http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap-envelope'                 xmlns:rep='http://www.w3.org/2004/08/representation'                 xmlns:xmlmime='http://www.w3.org/2004/06/xmlmime'&gt;    &lt;soap:Header&gt;      &lt;rep:Representation resource='http://example.org/&#20889;&#30495;.png'&gt;        &lt;rep:Data xmlmime:contentType='image/png'&gt;/aWKKapGGyQ=&lt;/rep:Data&gt;      &lt;/rep:Representation&gt;    &lt;/soap:Header&gt;    &lt;soap:Body&gt;      &lt;x:MyData xmlns:x='http://example.org/mystuff'&gt;        &lt;x:name&gt;John Q. Public&lt;/x:name&gt;        &lt;x:img src='http://example.org/&#20889;&#30495;.png'/&gt;      &lt;/x:MyData&gt;    &lt;/soap:Body&gt; &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;  Also, the following should be legal:  &lt;soap:Envelope xmlns:soap='http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap-envelope'                 xmlns:rep='http://www.w3.org/2004/08/representation'                 xmlns:xmlmime='http://www.w3.org/2004/06/xmlmime'&gt;    &lt;soap:Header&gt;      &lt;rep:Representation resource='http://&#20363;.org/me.png'&gt;        &lt;rep:Data xmlmime:contentType='image/png'&gt;/aWKKapGGyQ=&lt;/rep:Data&gt;      &lt;/rep:Representation&gt;    &lt;/soap:Header&gt;    &lt;soap:Body&gt;      &lt;x:MyData xmlns:x='http://example.org/mystuff'&gt;        &lt;x:name&gt;John Q. Public&lt;/x:name&gt;        &lt;x:img src='http://&#20363;.org/me.png'/&gt;      &lt;/x:MyData&gt;    &lt;/soap:Body&gt; &lt;/soap:Envelope&gt;  6. How are the URIs matched?  For example, are they case-sensitive?  If you take the two URIs/IRIs in the example above, Representation-resource and img-src, then do the following pairs match? (here the image data is  actually taken from the data in the header, rather than reported as 'not  found'):  1) http://example.org/me.png         http://example.org/me.png 2) http://example.org/me.png         http://example.org/me.png 3) http://example.org/me.png         http://Example.org/me.png 4) http://example.org/me.png         http://example.org:80/me.png 5) http://example.org/~me.png        http://example.org/%7Eme.png 6) http://example.org/%7Eme.png      http://example.org/%7eme.png  These are only some of the simpler examples that are not clear at all. Namespaces say that only 1) matches. RDF does the same. When actually resolving, all of these will go to the same place on the same server. So what happens in the case of this spec?     </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2004Sep/0000.html\">email</a>] </description>   <proposal>   </proposal>   <resolution> <pre> [NOTE: the issue has been reclosed after clarification of the following email,  see below for further information]  point 5: The following text was added to section 4.2.2: &lt;&lt;&lt; The value of the resource attribute information SHOULD be a URI Reference  as defined in RFC 2396 including ammendments to that definition found in  RFC 2732. &gt;&gt;&gt;  point 6: The following text was added in section 4.1: &lt;&lt;&lt; URIs that are character for character identical MUST be considered equal  when using a representation header to resolve a web reference; URIs that  are considered equal according to the URI scheme of the URI SHOULD be  considered equal. &gt;&gt;&gt; Please note that the use of the Representation header does NOT mandate  that its content is the authoritative representation of the resource.

What happens when the resource in the rep:Data element has an xmlmime:contentType attribute for a textual type, such as text/* or application/*+xml?  The charset handling should be discussed here (unless text/*, application/*+xml and other text types are explicitly forbidden).  2. If text types are allowed, what does it mean to have and not have a charset attribute?  3. If text types are allowed, is base64 still a requirement?  What happens when you have the SOAP document in one charset and the SOAP RRH with a text document in another charset?  While we understand that requiring the base64 type simplifies processing and avoids unnecessary character encoding processing, it does introduce some additional opportunity for encoding mismatches to occur.  4. What heppens when the resource in question is available in multiple languages?  If the language negotiation is done by the resource host, how is that indicated to the receiving service?  There should be the possibility of xml:lang on the resource.    </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2004Sep/0000.html\">email</a>] </description>   <proposal>   </proposal>   <resolution> <pre>    We received your note [1] which raises a number of questions about our issue 501 [2].  This note deals primarily with your concern that:  \"We also believe that forcing base64 encoding on readable text is a mistake which will introduce a number of problems, not the least of which is masking the fact that the inline data needs to be tagged.  We feel it should be strongly discouraged, if not disallowed.\"  We think that perhaps the design point of XOP and MTOM may have been misunderstood.  The intended purpose of XOP and MTOM is to allow binary octet streams to be carried in XML documents in a manner that allows for good optimization of storage and networking formats.  Stated differently, the purpose of XOP and MTOM is to provide for tunnelling of binary data in an optimized way.    Like most filesystems and other systems that manage octet streams, we specifically avoid \"spying on\" the contents of that data or providing for special behavior according to the contents.  We don't provide special facilities for the case where the stream happens to be \"image/jpeg\" and we don't for \"text/*\" either.  While it's true that any system that supports octet streams can be used in the special case where the content happens to be encoded text, that is not the focus of XOP or MTOM, and we are reluctant to provide special mechanisms for dealing with text.   Indeed, where such special handling is desired, XOP and MTOM should not be used.  We think that users can make that decision according to their needs.  When XOP and MTOM are used, they should be viewed as a completely opaque tunnel;  the data should be treated as characters only before it is encoded or after it has been \"extracted\" from its encapsulated form.  You ask:  \"why base64Binary\" for text input streams?  As discussed above, we strongly believe that we should not treat text differently from other octet streams.  To reiterate why we use base64Binary for all such streams: XOP and MTOM do their jobs by establishing a correspondence between binary data stored in its \"native\" form as a \"part\" in MIME, and a corresponing character representation in an Infoset.  For this, base64Binary is provides a natural and standardized character representation.  It is a byproduct of this design that if a user choosesto tunnel character data as if it were binary, the representation will indeed seem somewhat more appropriate to binary content than to text.  In situations where this is not the desired behavior,  XOP and MTOM should not be used.  We note as an aside that if someone did decide to use MTOM with, say, an XHTML document encoded in BIG5, and if you looked at the corresponding XOP MIME part, you would find exactly the BIG5 stream not the base64Binary characters;  the base64Binary characters are an artifact defined by the specification, to be used only in the case where the application specifically needs a view of the data in the Infoset.  For example, one might compute a digital signature for the entire containing infoset, including the base64 characters corresponding to the nested document.  It is anticipated that realistic implementations will not in fact surface the base64 character form on the wire, in memory, or through APIs unless requested for some such purpose.  So, there is emphasis in practice on dealing directly with the BIG5, in this example, as opposed to the base64Binary encoding of the BIG5.  A related issue about which you ask is the means by which metadata about the nested or tunneled octet stream can be conveyed.  This is architecturally orthogonal to XOP and MTOM in our design.  For example, we recommend the use of the xmime:content-type attribute [3] with base64-encoded octet streams in any case where they correspond to MIME-typed documents, and regardless of whether such content is to be optimized with XOP or conveyed in a normal XML 1.0 or XML 1.1 character stream.  Conversely, other forms of description could be used without changing MTOM or XOP.   We have taken the trouble to define the one attribute, xmime:content-type that we feel will be of particularly general utility;  we invite you and other members of the XML community to define additional such attributes that may be necessary for purposes such as i18n. We also note that the working draft at [3] says of the xmime:content-type attribute:  \"The [normalized value] of the contentType attribute information item MUST be the name of a IANA media type token, e.g., \"image/png\", \"text/xml; charset=utf-16\"\"  which specifically illustrates the use of charset.   We generally decline to provide normative information in two places;  in this case, we think that it's appropriate that use of the charset specification is indeed documented with the normative recommendation for the xmime:content-type attribute and not in xop or mtom themselves.    We hope that this note clarifies the reasons for the decisions we have made. </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2004Oct/0004.html\">email</a>] <pre> [Point 1 clarification]    We received your note [1] which raises a number of questions about our issue 501 [2].

As this parameter is (optionally) supported, and may be  important for some implementations, it is important to have a consistent way  to describe how to set it.  During this week's WS-Desc telcon, we discussed a proposal to express the value of the action parameter in WSDL as a Property (per the SOAP 1.2/WSDL 1.2  feature/property extensibility model), in a very similar manner to Web-Method.  However, we noted that the HTTP binding should really expose this feature  explicitly, again, for exactly the same reasons we exposed web-method as a  property.  We therefore propose the following change to the SOAP 1.2 spec:  PROPOSAL:  Introduce an \"action\" feature with a single defined property  (\"http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap/features/action/Action\") which has the  behavior of setting the MIME action parameter in bindings.  The HTTP binding  would natively support this feature.  This is a fairly minor change to the spec, which would not change  implementations in any way.  However, it would make description languages  (WSDL) and other specifications easier to write, in line with the reasons  for the feature/property model in the first place.  Note that it is certainly possible to write implementations which set this  parameter using custom APIs, and other specs (including WSDL) which refer to  it in english, but this seems to be just the sort of thing which should be  expressed with the model.  Alternately, the same feature could be described and \"overlaid\" on top of the  HTTP binding in a separate note, but that would, to some extent, break the  clean encapsulation of bindings-as-feature-implementors.  In other words,  publishing a separate spec/note which says \"oh, by the way the normative HTTP  binding also supports this new feature here\" is no guarantee that all  implementations of the binding will recognize/refer to the correct property  values if they are referenced in WSDL descriptions or other specifications. </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Mar/0005.html\">email</a>] </description>   <proposal>   </proposal>   <resolution>   <pre> The XML Protocol WG has resolve this issue, and the editors have added a SOAP Action feature to Part 2 <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/xp/Group/2/06/LC/soap12-part2.html#ActionFeature\">[2]</a> along the lines of the proposal at <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2003Mar/0090.html\">[3]</a>.   </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Apr/0007.html\">email</a>]   </resolution> </issue>  <issue>   <issue-num>417</issue-num>   <title>RPC body spec slightly unclear?   </title>   <locus>spec</locus>   <requirement>n/a</requirement>   <priority>Design</priority>   <topic>meta</topic>   <status>Closed</status>   <Withdrawn />   <originator><a href=\"mailto:jacek@systinet.com\">Jacek Kopecky</a></originator>   <responsible></responsible>   <description>   <pre> It seems that the language in part 2 sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 [1] may be uclear to folks coming from SOAP 1.1 about the intent that when using SOAP RPC the SOAP:Body element only contains a single child element with the invocation or response.

To see one reason why, see the Mac IE screen shot at http://www.w3.org/2003/01/26-soap1.png. This rule also makes references markup fragile (doesn't apply to what you have right now).

If a \"Part\" could ever conceivably be updated without the others, I'd say it's three. XML Schema was treated as one spec though it has three parts. Then SOAP 1.2 \"specification(s)\" should match throughout the primer.  Decide whether to capitalize primer (Primer) or not and use that throughout.  This page shows how to link to Parts 1 and 2 from within Part 0. People reading from printouts need to know part and section numbers.  http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#linking-within  Words in the TOC and headings can be capitalized, for example, 2.2.2 Remote Procedure Calls and 4. Using Various Protocol Bindings.  Reword to avoid \"we\" (even if that means using the passive voice). For example, s/In section 2.2.1 we return to our example/Section 2.2.1 returns to the example/  http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#Translations http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-international/2000AprJun/0058  There are 151 occurrences of style=\"color: #000000\" that need to be cut.  In several places, style=\"color: #000000\" turns links from blue to black, for example:      &lt;a href=\"#L10309\" style=\"color: #000000\">section 4.1&lt;/a>  There are 13 empty &lt;span>s and one empty &lt;code> that can be cut.  The tables need summary attributes.  W3C uses en-US. You could replace the whilsts (chiefly British) with whiles.      http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=whilst  Also you could, in the first occurrence, do something like \"primer (pronounced &lt;em>prim&lt;/em>-er)\" as an aid to the reader. prime-er is chiefly British.       http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=primer      http://www.bartleby.com/61/wavs/87/P0558700.wav  \"The document is believed to be stable, and to encourage implementation by the developer community.\" needs re-writing to be a complete sentence.

For example, this needs a space after \"called\":           called&lt;a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/#encapsulation\">     header blocks&lt;/a>    (same for \"which is a role\", \"the ultimate SOAP receiver\", \"variety of       message exchange patterns\", \"sub-element, env:Node\")  The second occurrence of Interface Definition Language should be capitalized. Either that or establish (IDL) after the first occurrence and use that in the second.  In \"freestanding [XML 1.0]\" the reference link is missing.  This sentence is too long:        Furthermore, in the case when an RPC definition is such that all       parts of its method description can be described as       resource-identifying and hence the entire resource may be       identified by a URI, and the supplier of the resource can assure       that a retrieval request is safe, then SOAP Version 1.2 recommends       that the choice of the Web method property of GET and the use of       the SOAP Response message exchange pattern used as described in       section 4.1.1.  It could be two, something like:        When all parts of an RPC definition method description can be       described as resource-identifying, the entire resource may be       identified by a URI. In this case, if the supplier of the resource       can assure that a retrieval request is safe, then SOAP Version 1.2       recommends the Web method property of GET and the SOAP Response       message exchange pattern used as described in section 4.1.1.  This paragraph confused me:        SOAP Version 1.2 has a number of changes in syntax and provides       additional (or clarified) semantics from those described in [SOAP       1.1]. The following is a list of features where the two       specifications differ. The purpose of this list is to provide the       reader with a quick and easily accessible summary of the       differences between the two specifications. The following list has       been put in categories purely for ease of reference, and in some       cases, an item might equally well have been placed in one or       another category.  It could be shorter, something like:        SOAP Version 1.2 has a number of changes in syntax and provides       additional and clarified semantics from those in [SOAP 1.1]. The       following is a summary of features where the two specifications       differ. The categories are purely for ease of reference. In some       cases, an item might equally well have been placed in another       category.  Reference titles should point to the dated version. See:      http://www.w3.org/2001/06/manual/#References      \"If there is an institutionalized identifier (URI) for a document,      cite the most specific identifier. For example, link to      http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224 rather than to      http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/.\"  In References and throughout, you have \"[SOAP Part1]\" yet \"[XML Schema  Part 1]\". I would make the spacing match. Same for part 2.   Also in References, for [SMTP] you can link to those RFCs and treat  them like the other references. I think IETF recommends URIs like this:       http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfcNNNN.txt   </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jan/0023.html\">email</a>]   </description>   <proposal>   </proposal>   <resolution>   <pre> As editor, I was assigned to handle your editorial comments, which was assigned as CR Issue #405.

It is a cut-and-paste error from section 5.4.8.2.  Section 5.4.7.3 defines SOAP qname AII as it can appear on the SupportedEnvelope EII. Section 5.4.8.2 defines SOAP qname AII as it can appear on the NotUnderstood EII. But the text in both the sections is identical.  The following text in section 5.4.7.3:  \"Its value is the XML qualified name of a SOAP header block which the faulting node failed to understand.

We are aware that the XML Protocol WG, of which you are the chair, is using SQL/XML's \"escape sequence\" algorithm in your specifications.  We also believe that your use of that algorithm is by copy and not by reference, so we think that it is incumbent on us to notify you if we change our algorithm so that you can consider whether or not to change yours correspondingly.  Please circulate this to your Working Group as you feel appropriate.  The change that we have made is fairly simple, in fact.  As you will recall, we represent Unicode characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) either as their native character or as an escape sequence of the form  \"_xXXXX_\", where \"XXXX\" represents exactly four hexadecimal digits (hexits).  Unicode characters not on the BMP were formerly represented by an escape sequence of the form \"_xXXXXXXXX_\", using exactly eight hexits.  In order to better align with the Unicode Consortium's requirements and recommendations, we have agreed to change the non-BMP escape sequence to use exactly *six* hexits instead of eight: _xXXXXXX_  If you would like more information about this change, you might be interested to read the paper that proposes this change.

Section 2.7.4 states that \"All XML infoset properties of a message MUST  be preserved with the following exceptions: [long list]\" but doesn't  mention anything about the mustUnderstand, role and relay attributes.  However, in contradiction to this:  (i) Section 5.2.2 <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/#soaprole\">[2]</a> (SOAP role Attribute) states that 'If relaying the  message, a SOAP intermediary MAY omit a SOAP role  attribute  information item if its value is  \"http://www.w3.org/2002/12/soap-envelope/role/ultimateReceiver\"'.  (ii) Section 5.2.3 <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/#soapmu\">[3]</a> (SOAP mustUnderstand Attribute) states that 'If  relaying the message, a SOAP intermediary MAY substitute \"true\" for the  value \"1\", or \"false\" for \"0\". In addition, a SOAP intermediary MAY  omit a SOAP mustUnderstand  attribute information item if its value is  \"false\"'.  (iii) Section 5.2.4 <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part1-20021219/#soaprelay\">[4]</a> (SOAP relay Attribute) states that 'If relaying  the message, a SOAP intermediary MAY substitute \"true\" for the value  \"1\", or \"false\" for \"0\". In addition, a SOAP intermediary MAY omit a  SOAP relay attribute information item if its value is \"false\"'.  I think this was an oversight when section 2.7.4 was constructed and to  restore consistency I propose that we add three bullets to the list in  section 2.7.4 as follows:  19 SOAP role attribute information items that are present in the  [attributes] property of SOAP Header block element information items  may be transformed as described in 5.2.2 SOAP role Attribute.  20 SOAP mustUnderstand attribute information items that are present in  the [attributes] property of SOAP Header block element information  items may be transformed as described in 5.2.3 SOAP mustUnderstand  Attribute.  21 SOAP relay attribute information items that are present in the  [attributes] property of SOAP Header block element information items  may be transformed as described in 5.2.4 SOAP relay Attribute. </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2003Jan/0010.html\">email</a>]</description>   <proposal> See <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xml-dist-app/2003Jan/0011.html\">email</a>   </proposal>   <resolution>   <pre> Issue 401 was discussed on todays XMLP telcon and the fix suggested by  the issue originator was adopted as the issue resolution.     </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jan/0006.html\">email</a>] </resolution> </issue>   <issue>   <issue-num>400</issue-num>   <title>Editorial - part 2 - name of struct   </title>   <locus>spec-part2</locus>   <requirement>n/a</requirement>   <priority>Editorial</priority>   <topic>meta</topic>   <status>Closed</status>   <AcceptedSOAP />   <originator><a href=\"mailto:cunnings@lectrosonics.com\">Bob Cunnings</a></originator>   <responsible></responsible>   <description>   <pre> In Part 2 section 4.2.2 RPC Response <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/CR-soap12-part2-20021219/#rpcresponse\">[1]</a> the first bullet states that:  \"The response is represented by a single struct containing an outbound  edge for the return value and each [out] or [in/out] parameter.\"  Nothing is specified about the name of the struct.

Similar terminology is under consideration for inclusion in future  versions of [Namespaces in XML]. Should future versions of [Namespaces  in XML] adopt alternative terminology, we anticipate that corresponding  changes will be made to this recommendation in the form of an erratum,  or in conjunction with some other future revision.\"  (ii) Where appropriate, replace the term 'XML qualified name' with 'XML  expanded name' throughout part 1 and part 2.   </pre> [<a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jan/0010.html\">email</a>, modified by <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xmlp-comments/2003Jan/0016.html\">second resolution email</a>] </resolution> </issue>    <!-- Maintainers -->    <maintainer>      <initials>CB</initials>      <fullname>Carine Bournez</fullname>      <uri>http://www.w3.org/People/carine/</uri>    </maintainer>     <maintainer>      <initials>YL</initials>      <fullname>Yves Lafon</fullname>      <uri>http://www.w3.org/People/Lafon/</uri>    </maintainer>   </issues> ",
