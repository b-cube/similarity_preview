This is a speech written on behalf of the plaintiff, <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name>, who is suing his brother-in-law, <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name>.  <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name>, upon the death of his relative <name type=\"person\">Comon</name> (the family relationship is not specified), agreed with <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> to split the estate in half, each man keeping an equal share. The two men wrote articles of agreement and made oaths binding themselves to this pact (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 48\" n=\"Dem. 48.9\">Dem. 48.9</bibl>).  Their agreement held until it was discovered that a slave of <name type=\"person\">Comon</name>, <name type=\"person\">Moschion</name>, had stolen a portion of <name type=\"person\">Comon</name>&#8217;s money.  <name type=\"person\">Moschion</name> had been a trusted servant of <name type=\"person\">Comon</name>, but had taken advantage of <name type=\"person\">Comon</name>&#8217;s trust by stealing first 1000 drachmas (see also <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>) and later 70 minas.  According to their agreement, when it was discovered that some of the money was missing, <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> agreed to put the slave <name type=\"person\">Moschion</name> to torture, but he voluntarily admitted to the theft of 1000 drachmas.  He did not, however, mention the taking of the 70 minas.  <name type=\"person\">Moschion</name> was ordered to pay back the money that he had admitted to stealing; in total, he paid back about 600 drachmas (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 48\" n=\"Dem. 48.17\">Dem. 48.17</bibl>), which was divided equally between <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> according to their agreement.  Later, <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> actually placed the slave under torture, this time without the consent of <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name>.  While under torture, the slave <name type=\"person\">Moschion</name> admitted to the theft of the seventy minas.  He had not spent any of it and so he returned the entire sum to <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name>.  <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name>, though, kept all of the money that he recovered from <name type=\"person\">Moschion</name> without splitting it evenly with <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name>, as their agreement had required (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 48\" n=\"Dem. 48.19\">Dem. 48.19-20</bibl>).  At the same time that these events were taking place, a flurry of claimants to the estate of <name type=\"person\">Comon</name> appeared to press their claims in court.  <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name> went to court and lost the judgement and, consequently, the estate of <name type=\"person\">Comon</name> was awarded to other claimants.  They then decided to enter separate suits against the other claimants; <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> sued for the entire estate, <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name> for half.  The result of these lawsuits was that <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> was awarded the estate.  According to the original agreement between he and <name type=\"person\">Callistratus</name>, he was to split the estate in half (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 48\" n=\"Dem. 48.31\">Dem. 48.31</bibl>).  <name type=\"person\">Olympiodorus</name> refused to do this and the present lawsuit was the result of his refusal.  This speech, because it takes place during the archonship of <name type=\"person\">Pythodotus</name>, can be dated to <date value=\"-343\">343 BCE</date> (source for date: <bibl>A.T. Murray, <title>Demosthenes II</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1930] 349</bibl>).</p> <byline>Christopher Cotten</byline> </div0>              </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
