Getting enough of the right kind of food affects cellular function and energy acquisition, disease avoidance, mate attraction, trophic interactions and hence ecosystem structure. When nutritional needs are inadequately met, fecundity and survival can be adversely affected. However, the severity of these effects, and the importance of the particular life history stage when they were experienced, is incompletely understood. Understanding how and when nutritional conditions affect fitness is particularly important for the conservation of endangered species, especially when food supplementation is a key part of managing the few populations that remain. In this thesis, I explore the importance of nutrition during early- and adult-life for the hihi (Notiomystis cincta), a colourful, sexually dichromatic endangered New Zealand passerine.&#13; &#13; I begin by investigating the importance of nestling nutritional environment for the expression of colourful plumage in adulthood. By experimentally supplementing nestlings with alternative dietary treatments, I demonstrate that early life nutritional conditions have long-term consequences for the expression of both carotenoid-based and structurally produced plumage features. Next I investigate whether these colourful plumage traits are sexually selected. I show that different components of a male\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds colourful plumage, including yellow carotenoid-based, black melanin-based and white structurally-based colour, are relevant for different aspects of reproductive success. Using the dietary supplementation experiment, I also consider the impact of alternative supplementary foods on the growth and subsequent survival of hihi. I show that directly supplementing nestlings with protein has a negligible long-term survival benefit over supplementing carbohydrates, and present evidence that males and females have divergent nutritional needs during development \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd an important consideration for any supplementary feeding program. Finally, I consider whether moulting male hihi selectively forage for carotenoid-rich foods in the wild, as would be expected in a species that requires these pigments for sexual display. I present evidence that adult male hihi do indeed target carotenoid-rich foods during moult, which is consistent with the suggestion that dietary carotenoid access maintains signal honesty.&#13; &#13; In short, by addressing evolutionary questions from a nutritional perspective, I discover how and when investment in key life history traits is prioritised, how this differs between the sexes and show how this knowledge might be used in supplementary feeding programs to the benefit of endangered species. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246926\"> <title>Towards the identification of the loci of adaptive 2 evolution</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246926</link> <description>Towards the identification of the loci of adaptive 2 evolution Pardo-Diaz, Carolina; Salazar, Camilo; Jiggins, Chris D. Summary:&#13; 1: Establishing the genetic and molecular basis underlying adaptive traits is one of the major goals of evolutionary geneticists in order to understand the connection between genotype and phenotype and elucidate the mechanisms of evolutionary change. Despite considerable effort to address this question, there remain relatively few systems in which the genes shaping adaptations have been identified.&#13; 2: Here, we review the experimental tools that have been applied to document the molecular basis underlying evolution in several natural systems, in order to highlight their benefits, limitations and suitability. In most cases, a combination of DNA, RNA and functional methodologies with field experiments will be needed to uncover the genes and mechanisms shaping adaptation in nature.

RNA interference (RNAi) is a widespread and widely exploited phenomenon. Here, we show that changing inositol 1,4,5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtrisphosphate (IP3) signalling alters RNAi sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Reducing IP3 signalling enhances sensitivity to RNAi in a broad range of genes and tissues. Conversely up\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdregulating IP3 signalling decreases sensitivity. Tissue\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdspecific rescue experiments suggest IP3 functions in the intestine. We also exploit IP3 signalling mutants to further enhance the sensitivity of RNAi hypersensitive strains. These results demonstrate that conserved cell signalling pathways can modify RNAi responses, implying that RNAi responses may be influenced by an animal's physiology or environment.
