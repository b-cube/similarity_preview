The inundation maps, which can be accessed through the USGS Flood Inundation Mapping Science Web site at http://water.usgs.gov/osw/flood_inundation/, depict estimates of the areal extent and depth of flooding corresponding to selected water levels (stages) at the USGS streamgage at [STATION NAME]  (sta. no. XX-XXXXXX).  Current conditions at the USGS streamgage may be obtained on the Internet.   In addition, the information has been provided to the National Weather Service (NWS) for incorporation into their Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) flood warning system (http:/water.weather.gov/ahps/).  The NWS forecasts flood hydrographs at many places that are often collocated at USGS streamgages.  The forecasted peak-stage information, also available on the Internet, may be used in conjunction with the maps developed in this study to show predicted areas of flood inundation.  (include this paragraph if applicable)     In this study, flood profiles were computed for the stream reach by means of a one-dimensional step-backwater model.  The model was calibrated using the most current stage-discharge relations at the [STATION NAME] gage and documented high-water marks from recent floods (if available).  The hydraulic model was then used to determine XX water-surface profiles for flood stages at XX-ft intervals referenced to the streamgage datum and ranging from bankfull to approximately the highest recorded water level at the streamgage.  The flood-peak inundation area was modeled in a GIS by combining [high-water mark data, and/or steady-state hydraulic modeling] and available [Lidar] digital elevation model (DEM) data as part of the U.S. Geological Survey study of the flood of [Month Year] in [City, State].  Information about the study, floods, and methods used can be found in the USGS Scientific Investigations Map XXXX.  http://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/XXXX</abstract>    <purpose>This dataset was created to support the development of flood-peak inundation maps for documenting the extent of the [MONTH YEAR] flood along a reach of the XXX River in [CITY, STATE].</purpose>    <langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata><supplinf>A GIS application was used to produce a plane representing the flood-peak water surface. The application duplicates the [high-water-mark elevation data points, and/or water-surface-elevation data from cross-section points] across the flood plain perpendicular to the direction of the flood flow.  Elevations between [high-water marks, or water-surface points on the cross-sections] are proportional interpolations of the water-surface-elevation data and were positioned to generate a flood surface sloping with the water flow. A raster surface was created with the data points using a spline interpolation method, forming the estimated flood surface. A flood-depth grid was made by subtracting the DEM from the flood surface. The flood-peak inundation areas are available in a GIS format, polyline shapefile, that provides extent of the flood peak for each stage level. This format allows the GIS data to be overlain on maps and aerial photographs, and to be used for various GIS applications, such as FEMA's Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazards (HAZUS-MH) program (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2010b) to estimate flood damages.

The flood boundaries shown were estimated based on water stages/streamflows at the USGS streamflow-gaging station XXXXXXXX, [STATION NAME], steady-state hydraulic modeling (assuming unobstructed flow), and a digital elevation model. The hydraulic model reflects the land-cover characteristics and any bridge, dam, levee, or other hydraulic structures existing on [MONTH, YEAR].  Unique meteorological factors (timing and distribution of storm) could cause actual streamflows along the modeled reach to vary from those assumed during a flood, which may lead to deviations from the water surface elevations and inundation boundaries shown here.  Additional areas may be flooded due to unanticipated backwater from major tributaries along the main stem or from localized debris- or ice-jams.

If this series of flood inundation maps will be used in conjunction with National Weather Service (NWS) river forecasts, the user should be aware of additional uncertainties which may be inherent or factored into NWS forecast procedures.  The NWS uses river forecast models to estimate the quantity and timing of water flowing through selected river reaches in the United States.  These forecast models (1) estimate the amount of runoff generated by a precipitation event, (2) compute how the water will move downstream, and (3) predict the flow and stage (water surface elevation) for the river at a given location (AHPS forecast point) throughout the forecast period (every six hours and 3 to 5 days out in many locations).
