The central focus of this study was an in-depth assessment of the similarities and differences in parenting practices, parent-child relationships, child psychological adjustment and parental social experiences in British-born Indian, Pakistani and non-immigrant White mothers with 5-7 year old children living in culturally diverse areas of the UK. This is the first in-depth comparative study focusing on normative second generation families rather than disadvantaged samples.&#13; In total, 90 mothers participated, and the study employed a multi-method approach. A range of measurement techniques including standardised interviews, questionnaires, observations of parent-child interaction and a child test were used. The study was organised according to two aspects of family life. A quantitative approach was used to investigate parenting and child adjustment. A mixed-methods approach, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses was used to examine the broader social environment of the mother and child, exploring family life in relation to surrounding cultural and contextual factors in the three ethnic groups.&#13; The children showed positive levels of adjustment, with no differences between groups. In terms of parenting, similarities were found between family types for some aspects of parenting as assessed by interview, including maternal warmth, mother-child interaction and maternal control. The differences that were identified generally reflected differences between the Pakistani and White mothers, with the Indian mothers lying between the two. For example, the British Pakistani group showed higher levels of child supervision, child-centredness, and overt discipline compared to White mothers. They were also more likely to be in an arranged marriage and less likely to confide in their partner. Regarding the observational measure of mother-child interaction, there was no difference between family types for the overall construct of mutuality.&#13; In relation to cultural and contextual factors, Pakistani mothers were more religious, compared with Indian and White mothers. Overall, both second generation Indian and Pakistani mothers showed a more bicultural identity. Qualitative analysis revealed that a range of ethnic-racial socialisation techniques for discussing race and ethnicity with children were used by mothers from all groups. Pakistani mothers remained more traditional and were most likely to use religio-cultural socialisation whereas Indian and White mothers used&#13; egalitarianism more, i.e. teaching children the importance of individual qualities as opposed to membership in their ethnic group. Indian mothers were the most positive about multiculturalism and seemed to face fewer challenges associated with diversity. Both Pakistani and White mothers experienced discrimination. White mothers felt they were still trying to adapt to increased diversity, some believing that their culture was being sidelined and under threat.&#13; It was concluded that there were many similarities in parenting practices and family life between British Indian, British Pakistani and non-immigrant White groups, with children from each group showing positive adjustment. However, although all mothers were born and raised in Britain, differences still existed indicating that ethnicity was an influential factor in parenting. The study increases understanding of the extent to which the parenting processes that have been found to be most significant for positive child development can be generalised to other ethnic groups. It also provides information on acculturation patterns in the host society and what it means to be born to second generation parents and live in a multicultural environment in the UK today. The findings have implications for theory and policy development regarding family life in different ethnic groups. </description> <dc:date>2012-11-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245142\"> <title>Neurocognitive risk and protective factors in addictive disorders</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245142</link> <description>Neurocognitive risk and protective factors in addictive disorders Smith, Dana Cognitive impairments and changes in the structure and function of related brain regions, namely the prefrontal cortex and striatum, have long been implicated in drug addiction. However, it is unknown whether these abnormalities predate substance abuse, potentially serving as risk factors for dependence, or if they are the consequence of protracted use. To address this question, endophenotype research using stimulant-dependent individuals\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd biological siblings has been used to investigate traits implicated in the pathology of addiction. Impairments present in both groups suggest an underlying risk-state for dependence, while additional abnormalities present only in stimulant-dependent individuals reflect potential effects of the drugs themselves. Contrastingly, there are also individuals who use stimulant drugs in a controlled manner without developing dependence. These \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrecreational users\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd may lack the underlying traits that comprise a greater risk for dependence, or they might maintain additional protective factors against the development of addiction. Experiments in the first half of this dissertation used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neurocognitive similarities and differences between dependent stimulant users, their non-dependent siblings, recreational users of cocaine, and unrelated healthy control volunteers. In Chapter 2, performance on a colour-word Stroop task was impaired in both stimulant-dependent individuals and their siblings, suggesting an endophenotype of cognitive inefficiency. However, neural activity significantly differed between the groups, indicating additional changes specific to the use of stimulant drugs. In Chapter 3, dependent users showed significant attentional bias to salient stimuli on a cocaine-word Stroop task, with a concurrent increase in prefrontal activation. Conversely, recreational users showed resilience in the face of cocaine cues and a decrease in arousal. Finally, Chapter 4 explored differences in reward sensitivity to both generic and drug-specific reinforcers, comparing the effects of personal and family history of stimulant exposure on a monetary incentive delay task. &#13; It is also under debate whether the neurocognitive differences seen in stimulant-dependent individuals are unique to substance abuse, or if parallel changes in behaviour and neurobiology are present in similar addiction-spectrum disorders, such as binge eating leading to obesity. In Chapter 5, stimulant-dependent and obese individuals with binge-eating behaviours showed differences in their substance-specific and general reward responsivity on a novel reward-valuation task. However, in Chapter 6 a similar decline in orbitofrontal cortex grey matter volume in relation to both years of stimulant use and body mass index was identified, implicating an overlap in this area between both conditions. These findings are integrated in Chapter 7, discussing the neurocognitive risk and protective factors that underlie an individual\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds vulnerability for addiction, not only to stimulant drugs, but also potentially for other addictive behaviours. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245082\"> <title>The meanings of menopause:  identifying the bio-psycho-social predictors of the propensity for treatment at menopause</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245082</link> <description>The meanings of menopause:  identifying the bio-psycho-social predictors of the propensity for treatment at menopause Rubinstein, Helena All women will experience menopause by the time they have reached mid life. So it is surprising that, in comparison with other female reproductive experiences such as menarche, pregnancy and childbirth, there is relatively little research from a psychological perspective.&#13; The main aims of this study were to explore how women make sense of the menopause, to assess which factors predict symptom severity and treatment utilisation and to explore how women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds beliefs about menopause are located within their social context &#13; The study comprised three stages. Study 1 was a quantitative study with 149 women to develop new measures to assess women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds beliefs. The new belief scales were incorporated into study 2 which was a larger study with 344 women recruited from the general population and from specialist menopause clinics. This study sought to identify the factors that predict symptom severity and treatment utilisation. The main analysis was with 295 women who were peri- and postmenopause. A range of validated scales were used and a treatment utilisation scale was created. Hierarchical multiple regression and structural equation modelling were used to identify predictors of symptom severity and treatment utilisation.  A sub-sample of 30 women from study 2 went on to participate in study 3 which was a qualitative study designed to explore how beliefs about menopause influence symptom perception and decisions about treatment in the context of women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds daily lives. Diaries were completed and used in interviews in study 3 to enable more accurate recall of the social context of menopause events. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. &#13; Ninety one percent of the women in this study had sought treatment for menopause symptoms and the main predictors of treatment utilisation was symptom severity and the belief that menopause was a pathological illness. A key finding was that four social constructions of menopause were prevalent in this sample: menopause renders women invisible and unvalued, menopause is an illness that changes women, menopause is amenable to treatment with hormone therapy, and menopause is a temporary phase after which there is recovery. These four beliefs were significantly predictive of perceptions of symptom severity and of treatment utilisation. Furthermore, the social constructions mediated between symptom severity and different categories of treatment utilisation. Qualitative analysis revealed that women have inadequate knowledge of menopause and can be surprised and distressed by its onset, menopause is little talked of and is still \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtaboo, menopause is regarded by women as a significant phenomenon that changes them but this is not often acknowledged publicly, women and clinicians have difficulty in making attributions to menopause and neither women nor clinicians are able to define \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnormality\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd at menopause. &#13; These findings have major implications for how women interpret their symptoms, for how to manage the expectations of women in their 40s and 50s, and for how clinicians advise women at this stage of their life. </description> <dc:date>2013-11-12T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/244266\"> <title>Chinese parenting and children's compliance to adults: a cross-cultural comparative study</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/244266</link> <description>Chinese parenting and children's compliance to adults: a cross-cultural comparative study Huang, Ching-Yu Soar The current study examined the parenting beliefs and practices of Taiwanese, Chinese&#13; immigrant (all first-generation immigrants in the UK) and English mothers, and the&#13; compliance of their young children (aged 5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd7), in order to elucidate the effects of child&#13; temperament, culture and acculturation strategies on reported parenting beliefs and practices,&#13; observed parental behaviour, child behaviour, mother\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdchild interaction dynamics and&#13; children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds compliance.&#13; The data were collected from a total of 90 families with 5- to 7-year-old children in&#13; Taiwan and the UK. Child temperament, parenting beliefs and practices and acculturation&#13; were assessed using questionnaires, and parental behaviour, child behaviour, dyadic&#13; interaction dynamics and child compliance were assessed using observation in two tasks&#13; (Etch-A-Sketch and clean-up). Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with the&#13; Chinese immigrant parents to gather more information regarding their acculturation and&#13; parenting.&#13; Cultural differences were found between groups in reported as well as observed&#13; parenting and children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds compliance. The Taiwanese mothers reported greater use of&#13; Chinese-specific parenting and physical coercion and were observed to use more (gentle and&#13; assertive) physical intervention than both the Chinese immigrant and English mothers. The&#13; Chinese immigrant mothers reported a higher degree of child autonomy than the Taiwanese&#13; and English mothers, and also reported cultivation of their children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds independence. The&#13; stronger the Chinese immigrant mothers' affiliation with Chinese culture, the more they&#13; reported adopting the Chinese-specific parenting style; the longer they had been in the UK,&#13; the less they reported authoritarian parenting. The English mothers were rated as more&#13; responsive and less negatively controlling than the Chinese immigrant mothers; they also&#13; showed more positive affect than both the Chinese immigrant and Taiwanese mothers. There&#13; were few cultural differences between groups in the children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds behaviour, although Taiwanese&#13; children showed more situational compliance than Chinese immigrant children.&#13; Further regression analyses showed that child characteristics, such as child age and&#13; temperament, affected the parents\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds behaviour as well as dyadic interactional&#13; dynamics. Committed compliance, situational compliance and opposition were associated&#13; with different predictors, suggesting that they are qualitatively different and are associated&#13; with different developmental processes. Committed compliance may develop as children&#13; grow older, mediated by surgency; situational compliance, on the other hand, was associated&#13; with authoritarian parenting and mothers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd use of negative control, which varied by culture.&#13; Child opposition was predicted by neither child characteristics nor parenting.&#13; These findings provide valuable insights into parenting and children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds compliance in&#13; different cultural contexts. The results underscore the importance of looking at human&#13; development from a holistic perspective. The active role that children play in shaping their&#13; developmental process, their parents\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd parenting and the culture they live in should all be taken&#13; into account when attempting to understand their development. </description> <dc:date>2013-02-05T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
