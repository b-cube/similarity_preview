In this contribution we discuss the hypothesis that the thin-film morphology in the&#13; active layer of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is dictated by the state of the&#13; polymer in the coating solution, and that tuning aggregation of the active&#13; material in solution via its structure, or via processing additives, leads to&#13; a predictable morphology in thin films. We have synthesized and characterized&#13; the optoelectronic properties of a family of poly(terthiophene-alt-isoindigo)&#13; P(T3-iI) with varying side chains. Through this structural modification we&#13; are able to control polymer solubility, and intermolecular interactions among&#13; polymer chains leading to increased mobilities in OFETs and increased&#13; short-circuit currents in blends with fullerene derivatives for OPVs.&#13; Alternatively, processing additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane are shown to&#13; lead to drastic changes in the morphology and OPV device parameters.&#13; Characterization of polymer aggregation in solution is compared to the&#13; thin-film morphology observed by AFM with smaller domain sizes achieved with&#13; a wide range of additive structures, which leads to 6.5% power conversion&#13; efficiency in OPV devices using P(T3-iI):PC71BM blends.; Nabil Kleinhez, a graduate student in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, presents \"Employing Liquid Crystal Phases for Enhanced Semiconducting Polymer Morphologies for Organic Solar Cell and Transistor Applications\".  Polymer-based&#13; electronic devices including organic field-effect transistors (OFET) and&#13; organic photovoltaics (OPV) are attractive due to their potentially low cost,&#13; light-weight, large area and flexible nature. In order to improve device&#13; performance, processes must be developed to enhance the degree of&#13; intermolecular ordering between polymer chains in order to facilitate hopping&#13; of charges through the material. We have studied poly(3-hexylthiophene)&#13; (P3HT) as a model \\ufffd\\ufffd-conjugated semiconducting polymer and have investigated&#13; the emergence of a lyotropic liquid crystalline phase that could serve as a&#13; means of intermolecular ordering in solution and as a potential precursor to&#13; well-ordered thin films of P3HT for device applications. As P3HT dissolved in&#13; trichlorobenzene ages, the polymers self-assemble into nano-rods which are&#13; subsequently aligned when filled into capillary tubes. Using polarized&#13; optical microscopy, we have observed long range order as evidenced by near&#13; monodomain-like orientation behavior and other birefringent textures&#13; indicating the presence of a liquid crystalline phase under certain solution&#13; conditions. Raman spectroscopy performed on capillaries of these solutions&#13; allows quantification of the degree of ordering in the aligned P3HT, and we&#13; have observed an orientational order parameter that increases with solution&#13; aging time. UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and cryogenic&#13; transmission electron microscopy were employed to characterize the formation&#13; of P3HT nanostructures that give rise to ordering in the fluid state which&#13; can be transferred to the solid state for device applications.; Keith Knauer, a graduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering, presents \"The Operational Lifetime of Inverted Top-Emitting Organic Light-Emitting Diodes\".  Recent research results focused on inverted top-emitting organic&#13; light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) of both the single-unit and stacked varieties&#13; are presented. An OLED is an electroluminescent device consisting of organic&#13; semiconductor material placed between two electrodes, an anode and a cathode.&#13; When a voltage is applied across the device, current is injected and light is&#13; emitted. OLEDs are of growing interest in the application areas of full-color&#13; high definition displays and solid-state white lighting.&#13; &#13; Inverted top-emitting OLEDs have many advantages over conventional&#13; bottom-emitting OLEDs. Inverted OLEDs are more convenient to integrate with&#13; the n-type driving electronics used in active-matrix displays and&#13; top-emitting OLEDs can be fabricated on opaque substrates and can lead to a&#13; maximized pixel aperature ratio when fabricated on the driving electronics in&#13; active-matrix displays. Furthermore, these inverted top-emitting OLEDs can be stacked vertically leading to devices with enhanced operational lifetime,&#13; higher efficiency, and simpler color-mixing schemes than single-unit OLEDs.

Compared with inorganic semiconductors, polymer semiconductors have relatively low carrier mobilities and therefore carrier transport is considered a limiting factor determining the performance of a polymer solar cell. In addition to carrier mobility, carrier lifetime in the polymer:fullerene blends is another important parameter determining the cell efficiency. We have extensively studied the carrier transport and recombination properties of several donor-acceptor conjugated polymers. We found that while low mobilities in polymers lead to charge imbalance, high mobilities do not always lead to high power conversion efficiencies. In this presentation, we will present our device results based on dioctyldithieno silole (DTS) polymers with a wide-absorption band and excellent transport properties. Even though the DTS polymers have a high hole mobility, the power conversion efficiency of the resulting solar cells is limited by the low fill factor. In order to study the loss mechanism of the photo-current, we carried out transient photo-voltage (TPV) measurements to probe the bimolecular recombination of photo-carriers under open circuit condition. Based on our photo-CELIV (carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage) data, we found that the carrier recombination rate is strongly related to the energetic disorder of the semiconductor polymers. Finally, we will report on our recent progress of high efficiency polymer solar cells based on a low band-gap polymer having an alternating dithienogermole-thienopyrrolodione repeat unit (PDTG-TPD).

In 1993, white-light-emitting OLEDs were developed for the first time. Since then, the performance of white OLEDs has steadily improved and, today, they are considered to be the light source of the next generation. OLED displays based on white OLEDs have also been developed and large-size displays have been commercialized. Recently, high quantum efficiencies (QEs) are obtained by using phosphorescent emitters such as iridium complexes. External QE of 25-30% was achieved for blue, green and red OLEDs, which correspond to the internal QE of nearly 100%. Device lifetime at high luminance levels, which is required for general lighting, is significantly improved by using the multiphoton structure. By combining the above techniques, OLEDs can be extremely efficient and possess an extremely long life, even at high luminance level. In 2010, Lumiotec Inc. started a small-scale production of white OLED panels in Yonezawa, and luminaires using their panels have been commercialized.

The talk will illustrate some of the recent results on soft structures based on metal complexes able to aggregate in fibers, gels and soft mechanochromic materials. The use of platinum complexes as building block for luminescent reversible piezochromic and mechanochromic materials will be illustrated. The emission of the compounds can be tuned by an appropriate choice of the coordinated ligands as well as of their aggregation in different structures. The formation of soft assemblies allows the tuning of the emission color, by pressure and temperature leading to a new class of materials possessing reversible properties. Functional systems can also be created using inert or active nanocontainers such as microporous and mesoporous silica based nanoparticles. In particular examples using the crystalline allumino silicates, zeolite L, and mesoporous organosilicates will be discussed since these materials can act as nanocontainers and due to their biocompatibility used for biomedical applications. The different functionalization of their surface will be discussed, in particular with the aim to show that the particles can be decorated with different functional groups including biocompatible molecules and are able to perfom drug and DNA or RNA delivery inside the cell. The delivery can be probed by a kinetic analyses after the nanoparticles internalization. In particular using confocal fluorescent microscopy it is possible to follow the release of each single component as well as the positioning of the nanocontainers in real time and space. Such achievement allows us to study the fate of the different units and their release time. Also it will be shown how the molecules entrapped in the ordered channels can become active components. The alignment of electroactive molecules inside the narrow channels of a zeolite L, resulted in the formation of molecular wires. The molecular wire length is tunable between 30 and 100 nm and electrical measurements on the 1D assemblies were performed. Finally an ultra-high (&gt; 2000%) room-temperature magnetoresistance was observed applying only a few mT.
