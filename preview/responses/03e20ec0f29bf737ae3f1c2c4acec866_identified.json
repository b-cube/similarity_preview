This is a speech that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> wrote for a man named <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name>, who was suing his half-brother <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name>. In <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, a man was known by his given name (e.g. <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name>), plus either his father&#8217;s name (e.g. <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> son of <name type=\"person\">Mantias</name>), and the name of his deme, his local district in <placeName key=\"Attica\">Attica</placeName> (e.g. <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> son of <name type=\"person\">Mantias</name> from <placeName key=\"Thoricus\">Thoricus</placeName>). In the case for which this speech was written, <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> is suing his half-brother <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name> because, the plaintiff claims, <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name> has tried to assume the name <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> himself. Needless to say, if both plaintiff and defendant use the same given name, and both have the same father and both come from the same deme, great confusion is likely to result. The plaintiff here claims that he was his father&#8217;s legitimate son and was registered in the deme&#8217;s roll under the name <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name>, thus having claim to the name. Despite the fact that the plaintiff&#8217;s case seems clear-cut, it is almost certain that the plaintiff lost the case&#8212;in <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 40\" n=\"Dem. 40\">Dem. 40</bibl>, this same <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> is suing this same <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name> over a different matter, and at <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 40\" n=\"Dem. 40.18\">Dem. 40.18</bibl> we find that the suit was officially lodged against <soCalled><name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name></soCalled>, suggesting that after the first trial, <soCalled><name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name></soCalled> was allowed to continue using the name <soCalled><name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name></soCalled>. This case should serve as a reminder of the possible problems with using speeches as evidence; in the case of <name type=\"person\">Mantitheus</name> vs. <name type=\"person\">Boeotus</name>, there were two sides to the argument, and the one we have seems to have been the worse one. The speech was probably written in <date value=\"-348\">348 BCE</date> (Source for date: <bibl>R. Sealey, <title>Demosthenes and his Time: a study in defeat</title> [Oxford, 1993] 144</bibl>) </p> <byline>Christopher Blackwell</byline> </div0>    </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
