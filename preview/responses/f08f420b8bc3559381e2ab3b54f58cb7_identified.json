SSTs are provided as monthly averages on a 1 degree longitude/latitude global  grid and cover the period from 1st January 1997 to 31st December 2011. Equivalent data for Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (SSTA), relative to climatology, are also available.&#13; The dataset is derived from the data products of the ATSR Reprocessing for Climate: Sea Surface Temperature (ARC-SST_ project (Merchant et al, 2012). These are daily SST estimates on a 0.1 degree longitude/latitude grid and the methods used to derive the monthly 1 degree dataset are described in the accompanying technical note (tosTechNote_ATSR_L3_ARC-v1.1.1_199701_201112.pdf).&#13; The ARC-SST source data from which this dataset is derived is available at: &#13; http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/neodc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__DE_3abf8c96-a7d6-11e0-9cb8-00e081470265  &#13; Reference: Merchant, C.

Accurate reconstruction of the fluvial domain is fundamental to understanding runoff generation, storm hydrology, biogeochemical cycling and landscape evolution. Many methods have been proposed for predicting channel head locations using topographic data, yet none have been tested against a robust field dataset of mapped channel heads across multiple landscapes.  In this study, four methods of channel head prediction were tested against field data from four sites with high-resolution DEMs: slope-area scaling relationships; GeoNet 2.0; a contour curvature technique proposed by Pelletier [2013]; and a new method presented here, which identifies the change from channel to hillslope topography along a profile using a transformed longitudinal coordinate system. Our method requires only two user-defined parameters, determined via independent statistical analysis. Slope-area plots are traditionally used to identify the fluvial-hillslope transition, but we observe no clear relationship between this transition and the field-mapped channel heads. Of the four methods assessed, Pelletier\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds [2013] tangential curvature method and our new method most accurately reproduce the measured channel heads in all four field sites (Feather River CA, Mid Bailey Run OH, Indian Creek OH, Piedmont VA), with mean errors of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd11, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd7, 5 and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd24 meters and 34, 3, 12 and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd58 meters respectively.  Negative values indicate channel heads located upslope of those mapped in the field.  Importantly, these two independent methods produce mutually consistent estimates, providing two tests of channel head locations based on independent topographic signatures. </description> <dc:date>2014-02-10T12:50:04Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/384\"> <title>ARC-Lake v2.0 - Per-Lake</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/384</link> <description>ARC-Lake v2.0 - Per-Lake ARC-Lake v2.0 - Per-Lake contains data products on a lake-by-lake basis.

The Consistent Areas Through Time (CATTs, Exeter, Boyle et al. 2005) were used to provide a consistent geography between the 1981, 1991 and 2001 censuses, for ease of comparison.  Specifically the CATT2 small area geography was use, giving 10,058 individual areas with an average population in 2001 of approximately 500 persons.&#13; &#13; Carstairs deprivation scores were unavailable for the CATT2 geography, therefore were calculated from raw census data.  This also enabled a second set of scores to be calculated without the car ownership component (called Adjusted Carstairs hereafter), as car ownership is more of a necessity in rural areas compared with urban areas and can bias deprivation scores (Christie and Fonea 2003).  Although unadjusted Carstairs scores have been used for national studies this was considered a useful opportunity to investigate how the car ownership component affected scores in rural areas.  &#13; &#13; The Carstairs score is constructed from four components that have been shown to measure deprivation well (Carstairs and Morris 1989):&#13; 1. Overcrowding: the percentage of all persons living in private households with a density of more than one person per room.&#13; 2. Male Unemployment: the percentage of economically active males seeking or waiting to start work&#13; 3. Low Social Class: the percentage of all persons in private households with an economically active head with head of household in social class IV or V. &#13; 4. No Car: the percentage of all persons in private households which do not own a car. </description> <dc:date>2009-03-16T17:38:27Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/17\"> <title>Refractive indices (500-3500 cm-) and emissivity (600-3350 cm-1) of pure water and seawater</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/17</link> <description>Refractive indices (500-3500 cm-) and emissivity (600-3350 cm-1) of pure water and seawater Tables of infrared refractive indices have been compiled and calculations made of emissivity for pure water and seawater (35 PSU), suitable for radiative transfer simulation of observations of thermal imagers, such as the series of Along Track Scanning Radiometers.
