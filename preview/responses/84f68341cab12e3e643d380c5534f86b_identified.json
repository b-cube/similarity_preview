Topics covered include the national economy, nuclear arms treaties between the United States and the Soviet Union, spending on space exploration, the shuttle program, federal spending on the military and defense programs, aid to the contras in Nicaragua, and whether certain aspects of a politician's personal life such as a serious medical condition or cheating on income taxes should be public knowledge. In addition, respondents were queried about their views on the candidates for the 1988 presidential election. Respondents were asked whether they had a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the various candidates, whom their party should nominate for president, whether the Republicans or the Democrats had a better group of candidates, and which candidate cared most about the needs of people like the respondent. Respondents who supported Gary Hart for the Democratic presidential nomination were telephoned again and asked an additional series of questions to determine whether disclosures by the media regarding improprieties in Hart's financing of his 1984 presidential campaign had changed their minds at all. Background information on individuals includes party affiliation, age, marital status, income, sex, religious preference, education, and race.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                     <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adults aged 18 and over in the United States.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Stratified random digit dialing.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          telephone interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
