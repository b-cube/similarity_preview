Additional areas of non-habitat, such as paved highways, municipal boundaries, water bodies etc., were also removed. However, the map extent for sage-grouse key habitat and potential restoration areas should be considered provisional, contingent on the final outcome of additional analyses currently underway in association with the national Greater Sage-grouse Conservation Strategy.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This data set contains simple, landscape-scale greater sage-grouse habitat types for Idaho and constitutes a current approximation of sage-grouse habitat in the state. The data can be used for general conservation and restoration planning purposes, but additional data or field verification are needed for applications at finer scales. The habitat types include: (1) key sage-grouse habitat areas and (2) four habitat restoration types: (a) R1 - perennial native and non-native grasslands with high restoration potential; (b) R2 - annual grass dominated areas (either shrubland or grassland) with low restoration potential; (c) R3 - conifer encroachment areas with high restoration potential and (d) RB - areas that have recently burned and the type of habitat that is coming back and its restoration potential has not yet been determined. A new data set will be developed annually to update the planning map and chart landscape-level changes in sage-grouse habitat over time. Edits may also document refinements discovered through inventory, monitoring and modeleing. This data covers all of Idaho and a small area in Nevada that is managed by Idaho BLM. Intended scale of use is 1:100,000. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This dataset is not synonomous with BLM's \"Preliminary Prioirty Hbitat\" or \"Preliminary General Habitat\" mapping efforts, as those incorporate additional habitat and sage-grouse population data or models.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;</idAbs><idPurp>Concerns about sage-grouse habitat trends in Idaho have increased in recent years, particularly after the wildfires in eastern and south central Idaho since the latter 1990s. Sagebrush steppe vegetation mapping efforts have occurred in many areas but techniques, scales, timeframes, and resolution vary. Idaho Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and conservation partners have an ongoing need for a spatial portrayal of existing and potentially restorable sage-grouse habitat for a variety of planning purposes. At a broad scale, the Idaho BLM Greater Sage-Grouse Planning Maps and data are intended to: 1. Identify key sage-grouse habitat areas for Idaho BLM that need to be conserved. 2. Identify areas of restoration potential that should be considered during restoration planning. 3. Be a tool for land use and fire planning at the Field Office, District, and State Office levels. 4. Graphically portray the degree of sage-grouse habitat fragmentation or recovery as it changes over time. 5. Assist field staff in identifying areas where sage-grouse habitat conservation or restoration will be a primary concern and those areas where sage-grouse will not be a management emphasis. 6. Serve as an educational tool for conservation planning and public outreach.  </idPurp><idCredit>Idaho Department of Fish and Game, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Department of Energy Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho Sage-grouse Local Working Groups, and other cooperators/contributors</idCredit><idStatus><ProgCd value=\"001\" /></idStatus><idPoC><rpIndName>Paul Makela</rpIndName><rpOrgName>U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Idaho State Office, Resources and Sciences</rpOrgName><rpPosName>Wildlife Biologist/Sage-grouse Lead</rpPosName><rpCntInfo><cntPhone><voiceNum tddtty=\"\">(208) 373-3800</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntAddress addressType=\"both\"><delPoint>1387 South Vinnell Way</delPoint><city>Boise</city><adminArea>ID</adminArea><postCode>83709-1657</postCode><country>UNITED STATES</country><eMailAdd>id_so_information@blm.gov</eMailAdd></cntAddress><cntHours>7:45 A.M. - 4:15 P.M., Mountain Time, Monday - Friday</cntHours></rpCntInfo><role><RoleCd value=\"007\" /></role></idPoC><resMaint><maintFreq><MaintFreqCd value=\"008\" /></maintFreq><maintNote>This dataset is a snapshot in time.

Direction from Wildlife Biologists and ESR. 2. All polygons that had been called RB in 2012, were changed to R1 except for the Stout Fire, which was changed to R2.  Direction from ESR. 3. The USFS submitted new habitat as a shapefile (Wildlife Biologist Scott Bodle).  Two out of the 3 polygons were added, one near the Cayuse Creek/Menneke Creek drainages and one near Wilson Flat.  The other polygon was duplicated by an area added by Crudeen which is located just north of Anderson Ranch Reservoir.  Since Crudeen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds polygon appeared more refined, the decision was made to keep this polygon.  The two new polygons from Scott Bodle were coded as RB since they were part of the Pony/Elk fires. 4. 2012 Drill seeding polygons were used to change R2 habitat to R1.   Direction from ESR. 5. Consulted with the Four Rivers Wildlife Biologist about the GIS layer for croplands that fall within habitat.  Even though there were a couple areas with significant crops that were irrigated, he opted to keep these areas in the habitat layer.  First, the sage-grouse telemetry layer shows birds moving through these areas to access leks.  Also, there is a possibility that these lands could be rested or put into CRP lands which would make them more desirable to wildlife. 6. Upper Castle Creek Juniper Cut \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd used polygon to change R3 to Key.  Direction from Fuels NEPA team. </stepDesc><stepDateTm>2014-01-17T00:00:00</stepDateTm><stepProc><rpIndName>Christa Braun</rpIndName><rpOrgName>U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Boise District</rpOrgName><rpPosName>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Specialist</rpPosName><role><RoleCd value=\"009\" /></role><rpCntInfo><cntAddress addressType=\"both\"><delPoint>3948 Development Avenue</delPoint><city>Boise</city><adminArea>Idaho</adminArea><postCode>83705</postCode><country>UNITED STATES</country></cntAddress><cntPhone><voiceNum tddtty=\"\">208-384-3300</voiceNum></cntPhone><cntHours>8:00 A.M. - 4:30 P.M., Mountain Time, Monday - Friday</cntHours></rpCntInfo></stepProc></prcStep><prcStep xmlns=\"\"><stepDesc>Idaho field offices added to and edited this data to reflect changes to habitat that occurred in 2013 or resulting from field reconnaissance.

Key habitat may or may not provide adequate nesting, early brood-rearing, and winter cover due to elevation, snow depth, lack of early season forbs, limited herbaceous cover, or small sagebrush patch size.  Note: In some cases, biologists may suspect sage grouse occupancy but documentation is lacking.  Local biologists should use professional judgement in determining the extent of the habitat polygons, with an explicit goal of conserving occupied and potentially occupied sage grouse habitat.  Restoration Habitats:  Restoration Type I (R1): Perennial Grasslands. Sagebrush-limited areas characterized by perennial grass species composition and/or structure that should provide suitable potential nesting habitat in the future, once sufficient sagebrush cover is re-established. Includes native and/or introduced perennial bunchgrasses. These sites have the potential to be restored to good ecological condition for sage grouse through natural recovery or by seeding/planting sagebrush. These areas need to be protected from future wildfires to facilitate recovery. Sage grouse may use these sites during summer, late brood-rearing, or fall, depending on forb and sagebrush availability.  After restoration or recovery of sagebrush (&gt;=10% canopy cover), these sites may become key habitat, and may also help to link or reconnect isolated sage grouse populations. Note: Such areas are often a result of  wildfires or seedings.  Restoration Type II (R2): Annual Grass Understories. Areas dominated or strongly influenced by invasive annuals such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum), medusahead rye (Taeniatherum caputmedusae) or similar species. Areas with sagebrush may be present, but, in general, understories are not suitable for sage grouse. R2 habitats may be re-classified as R1 once a restoration seeding has been determined to be successful based on local evaluation. Note: These areas often result initially from the expansion of invasive exotic herbaceous species into native or marginal seeded rangelands, and are then exacerbated and eventually maintained  by frequent wildfire. Lack of direct management intervention will likely lead  to perpetual dominance by the invasive species,  a shortening of fire return intervals, and loss of shrubs, depending on the site.  Restoration Type III (R3): Conifer Encroachment. Areas where junipers and/or other conifer species are encroaching into sage grouse habitat areas. Opportunities exist for improving habitat through appropriate fire management, prescribed fire, chemical, or mechanical methods. R3 habitats may be re-classified as R1, R2 or key as appropriate once conifer control efforts have been completed. Note: Some sage grouse habitats occurring at or near the sagebrush-steppe-conifer woodland interface are at risk to conifer encroachment or have already been rendered unsuitable for sage grouse due to conifer expansion.  Retarding juniper expansion in such situations, with a goal of shrub-steppe restoration, may be advisable.  Recent Burn (RB): Areas recently burned in a fire or fires and the habitat class is pending verification. </eaover></overview></eainfo><mdHrLvName Sync=\"TRUE\">dataset</mdHrLvName><refSysInfo><RefSystem><refSysID><identCode code=\"102605\" Sync=\"TRUE\" value=\"102605\" /><idCodeSpace Sync=\"TRUE\">ESRI</idCodeSpace><idVersion Sync=\"TRUE\">10.2.1</idVersion></refSysID></RefSystem></refSysInfo><spatRepInfo><VectSpatRep><geometObjs Name=\"WLDLFE_SageGrouseHabitat_Dissolved_PUB_100K_POLY_2013\"><geoObjTyp><GeoObjTypCd value=\"002\" Sync=\"TRUE\" /></geoObjTyp><geoObjCnt Sync=\"TRUE\">5</geoObjCnt></geometObjs><topLvl><TopoLevCd value=\"001\" Sync=\"TRUE\" /></topLvl></VectSpatRep></spatRepInfo><spdoinfo><ptvctinf><esriterm Name=\"WLDLFE_SageGrouseHabitat_Dissolved_PUB_100K_POLY_2013\"><efeatyp Sync=\"TRUE\">Simple</efeatyp><efeageom code=\"4\" Sync=\"TRUE\" /><esritopo Sync=\"TRUE\">FALSE</esritopo><efeacnt Sync=\"TRUE\">5</efeacnt><spindex Sync=\"TRUE\">FALSE</spindex><linrefer Sync=\"TRUE\">FALSE</linrefer></esriterm></ptvctinf></spdoinfo></metadata>",
