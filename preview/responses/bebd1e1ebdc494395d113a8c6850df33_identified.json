While some work was published on architectures and decentralized P2P-based mechanisms for such clouds, yet no complete system has been presented which implements such cloud systems without important limitations. We present the community home gateway, a computer system attached to a wireless community network router, able to host platform and application services. Different to current home gateways and other low-end systems, the community home gateway offers resource virtualization, and can thus be used as cloud resource. The community home gateway removes the lack of a system open for service contributions and therefore constitutes an important step towards building P2P clouds with low-end devices. While we present the community home gateway as being part of a P2P community cloud, the applications scenarios of the system that can be imagined go beyond community networks.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:publisher/><dc:date>2013-09-11</dc:date><dc:source>http://zenodo.org/record/8461</dc:source><dc:doi>10.1109/P2P.2013.6688732</dc:doi><dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8461</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8461</dc:identifier></dc:dc>   </collection>",
