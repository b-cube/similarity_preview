These data are stratified by year and month of admission, county of residence, age group, race/ethnicity and gender. Crude, age-adjusted, and modeled rates and confidence intervals are included.</abstract> <purpose>To provide data on the California Environmental Public Health Tracking Network consistent with the National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The guidance for creating asthma and myocardial infarction inpatient hospitalization Nationally Consistent Data and Measures (NCDMs) were developed by funded tracking states. &#13;  </purpose> <supplinf>Data has been de-identified to protect patient confidentiality.  Asthma and myocardial infarction hospitalizations are selected based on primary discharge diagnosis coding.&#13; &#13; The California EPHT Program receives calendar year inpatient hospitalization data annually from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).  Further information on OSHPD is located at: http://www.oshpd.ca.gov.&#13; &#13; All state licensed hospitals in California are required by California Health and Safety Code to report to OSHPD data elements for each inpatient discharged from the hospital.  The facilities submit their data semiannually via the Medical information Reporting for California (MIRCal), an on-line data transmission method.  Additional fields are computed by OSHPD, such as, length of stay, etc.  The patient&apos;s Social Security Number is encrypted to create a unique 9-digit record linkage number, which can be used to link records for the same patient.     &#13; &#13; </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20080510</caldate> <time/> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.5</westbc> <eastbc>-114.1</eastbc> <northbc>42.0</northbc> <southbc>32.5</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ICD-9-CM</themekt> <themekey>Asthma, Myocardial Infarction, MI, 493, 410</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst> Restricted (secure) data will only be released to external users after the California EPHT Program and representatives from OSHPD have reviewed the request.

These data are based only on primary discharge diagnosis codes (ICD9-CM).</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc> Since 1986, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) has been responsible for routinely collecting data on hospital discharges from every licensed acute care hospital in California, excluding federal hospitals.  Each year, OSHPD compiles the data from all hospitals to create the Patient Discharge Database (PDD).   &#13;&#13; Each year, CEHTP obtains the PDD dataset from OSHPD and creates datasets to be used for public health surveillance, while maintaining confidentiality.   &#13;&#13; This dataset on the CEHTP portal includes hospitalizations due to asthma and myocardial infarctions (heart attacks) for the years 2000 to 2005.  Each hospitalization event is identified by looking at principal discharge diagnosis based on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM).  A principal diagnostic ICD-9-CM code of 493 indicates a patient was admitted to a hospital because of asthma.  An ICD-9-CM code of 410 indicates a patient was admitted to a hospital because of a heart attack.  Each hospitalization event is identified based on date of admission into the hospital, rather than date of discharge. &#13;&#13; Counts, rates, and confidence intervals were calculated by county, age-group, gender, and race/ethnicity. &#13;&#13; To calculate rates, we use population data from the California Department of Finance (DOF).  DOF uses year 2000 population data collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and takes into account survival rates, migration patterns, and fertility rates for California to project the California population by county, race/ethnicity, age, and gender for 2000-2050 (State of California, Department of Finance, Population Projections for California and Its Counties 2000-2050, Sacramento, California, July 2007). &#13;&#13; Confidence intervals for rates of hospitalizations are calculated using the modified Wilson's score method (Croarkin C and Tobias P, Sect 7.2.4.1: Confidence Intervals. From NIST/SEMATECH Engineering Statistics Handbook, http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/prc/section2/prc241.htm ). &#13;&#13; Modeled rates are calculated for rates of hospitalizations through the use of a Hierarchical Bayesian model following the method of Besag, et al (Ann. Inst. Statist. Math 1991;43:1-59); medians from each posterior distribution are taken as point estimates for the geographic unit in question. &#13;&#13; For more information on how the data is calculated and accompanying limitations, see the methods section:   http://www.ehib.org/page.jsp?page_key=23#asthma_datasources_hosp </procdesc> <procdate>20081031</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>This data contains the following fields:&#13; Cnty_FIPS &#13; Start_Date &#13; End_Date   &#13; Measure_ID  &#13; Measure_VA &#13; &#13; Case counts are aggregated according to health outcome by admission year, admission month, county, age group, race/ethnicity and gender.&#13; </eaover> <eadetcit/> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>CEHTP Science Team</cntper> <cntorg>CDPH/EHIB</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos/> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>850 Marina Bay Parkway, Bldg P, 3rd Floor&#13; &#13; </address> <city>Richmond</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>94804</postal> <country>United States Of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(510)620-3620</cntvoice> <cnttdd/> <cntfax>(510)620-3720</cntfax> <cntemail>data@cehtp.org</cntemail> <hours/> <cntinst/> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc/> <distliab>Persons or entities given access to restricted data are liable for compliance with conditions set forth in the data use agreement.
