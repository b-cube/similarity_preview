The CollegesUniversities layer is sourced to the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS), National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education.  Data is provided via IPEDS as it is reported by each institution.  In a significant number of instances, IPEDS contains only one record for an institution when there exists one or more branch campuses for the institution.  The MultiCampus layer attempts to capture these additional PUBLIC Post Secondary Education campuses of colleges and universities associated with a single campus listed in the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS).  NCES provides enrollment and other information for one college or university (IPEDSID) and the data, in many cases, actually represents more than one campus. The coverage for the MultiCampus layer is the continental US, AK, HI, and PR.  However, the following states yielded no records within this layer even though all public colleges and universities were reviewed for unreported campuses as provided by NCES: District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, North Dakota, and PR. This layer attempts to identify the other campuses associated with the main, or NCES identified campus to more accurately distribute the enrollment population. Included are Doctoral/Research Universities, Masters Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges, Associates Colleges, Theological seminaries, Medical Schools and other health care professions, Schools of engineering and technology, business and management, art, music, design, Law schools, Teachers colleges, Tribal colleges, and other specialized institutions.   DISTRIBUTION OF ENROLLMENT AND FTE FROM THE PARENT IPEDS RECORD TO THE BRANCH/SATELLITE CAMPUSES IS AN ESTIMATE ONLY AND VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.   The following process was followed for this first version of MultiCampus:  Several enrollments were found through the public university websites and assigned to the appropriate records.  For those records without enrollment, the enrollment from the main campus was spatially distributed to all campuses linked to the main campus based on the area.  The area was determined by polygons outlining the campuses containing more than one building.  An enrollment was assigned to the campuses that only contained one building.  FTE was calculated as a percentage of the enrollment.    ANY RESULTS OR CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE ENROLLMENT AND FTE VALUES CONTAINED IN THIS LAYER SHOULD BE VERIFIED.]]></Abstract> <CRS>CRS:84</CRS> <CRS>EPSG:4326</CRS> <EX_GeographicBoundingBox><westBoundLongitude>-162.582935</westBoundLongitude><eastBoundLongitude>-68.802817</eastBoundLongitude><southBoundLatitude>25.474938</southBoundLatitude><northBoundLatitude>66.900559</northBoundLatitude></EX_GeographicBoundingBox> <BoundingBox CRS=\"CRS:84\" minx=\"-162.582935\" miny=\"25.474938\" maxx=\"-68.802817\" maxy=\"66.900559\"/> <BoundingBox CRS=\"EPSG:4326\" minx=\"25.474938\" miny=\"-162.582935\" maxx=\"66.900559\" maxy=\"-68.802817\"/>         <Style>           <Name>default</Name>           <Title>3</Title>           <LegendURL width=\"16\" height=\"17\">             <Format>image/png</Format>             <OnlineResource xlink:href=\"http://geodata.epa.gov/arcgis/services/OEI/ORNL_Education/MapServer/WmsServer?request=GetLegendGraphic%26version=1.3.0%26format=image/png%26layer=3\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" />           </LegendURL>         </Style>         <MaxScaleDenominator>944940.476190</MaxScaleDenominator>       </Layer>       <Layer queryable=\"1\">         <Name>4</Name>         <Title><![CDATA[Colleges and Universities]]></Title>         <Abstract><![CDATA[<a id=\"{9C49AE4B-F175-43D0-BCC6-A928FF54C329}\" href=\"https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B9C49AE4B-F175-43D0-BCC6-A928FF54C329%7D\">Full Metadata</a> Colleges and Universities: The colleges and university dataset is composed of all Post Secondary Education facilities as defined by the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS), National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education.

The CollegesUniversities layer is sourced to the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS), National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education.  Data is provided via IPEDS as it is reported by each institution. In a significant number of instances, IPEDS contains only one record for an institution when there exists one or more branch campuses for the institution. The MultiCampus layer attempts to capture these additional PUBLIC Post Secondary Education campuses of colleges and universities associated with a single campus listed in the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS).  NCES provides enrollment and other information for one college or university (IPEDSID) and the data, in many cases, actually represents more than one campus.   The coverage for the MultiCampus layer is the continental US, AK, HI, and PR.  However, the following states yielded no records within this layer even though all public colleges and universities were reviewed for unreported campuses as provided by NCES: District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, North Dakota, and PR. This layer attempts to identify the other campuses associated with the main, or NCES identified campus to more accurately distribute the enrollment population. Included are Doctoral/Research Universities, Masters Colleges and Universities, Baccalaureate Colleges, Associates Colleges, Theological seminaries, Medical Schools and other health care professions, Schools of engineering and technology, business and management, art, music, design, Law schools, Teachers colleges, Tribal colleges, and other specialized institutions.     DISTRIBUTION OF ENROLLMENT AND FTE FROM THE PARENT IPEDS RECORD TO THE BRANCH/SATELLITE CAMPUSES IS AN ESTIMATE ONLY AND VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS.   The following process was followed for this first version of MultiCampus:  Several enrollments were found through the public university websites and assigned to the appropriate records.  For those records without enrollment, the enrollment from the main campus was spatially distributed to all campuses linked to the main campus based on the area.  The area was determined by polygons outlining the campuses containing more than one building.  An enrollment was assigned to the campuses that only contained one building.  FTE was calculated as a percentage of the enrollment. ANY RESULTS OR CONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE ENROLLMENT AND FTE VALUES CONTAINED IN THIS LAYER SHOULD BE VERIFIED.]]></Abstract> <CRS>CRS:84</CRS> <CRS>EPSG:4326</CRS> <EX_GeographicBoundingBox><westBoundLongitude>-162.582935</westBoundLongitude><eastBoundLongitude>-68.802817</eastBoundLongitude><southBoundLatitude>25.474938</southBoundLatitude><northBoundLatitude>66.900559</northBoundLatitude></EX_GeographicBoundingBox> <BoundingBox CRS=\"CRS:84\" minx=\"-162.582935\" miny=\"25.474938\" maxx=\"-68.802817\" maxy=\"66.900559\"/> <BoundingBox CRS=\"EPSG:4326\" minx=\"25.474938\" miny=\"-162.582935\" maxx=\"66.900559\" maxy=\"-68.802817\"/>         <Style>           <Name>default</Name>           <Title>8</Title>           <LegendURL width=\"16\" height=\"16\">             <Format>image/png</Format>             <OnlineResource xlink:href=\"http://geodata.epa.gov/arcgis/services/OEI/ORNL_Education/MapServer/WmsServer?request=GetLegendGraphic%26version=1.3.0%26format=image/png%26layer=8\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" />           </LegendURL>         </Style>         <MaxScaleDenominator>94494.047619</MaxScaleDenominator>       </Layer>       <Layer queryable=\"1\">         <Name>9</Name>         <Title><![CDATA[Colleges and Universities Labels]]></Title>         <Abstract><![CDATA[<a id=\"{9C49AE4B-F175-43D0-BCC6-A928FF54C329}\" href=\"https://edg.epa.gov/metadata/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B9C49AE4B-F175-43D0-BCC6-A928FF54C329%7D\">Full Metadata</a> Colleges and Universities: The colleges and university dataset is composed of all Post Secondary Education facilities as defined by the Integrated Post Secondary Education System (IPEDS), National Center for Education Statistics, US Department of Education.
