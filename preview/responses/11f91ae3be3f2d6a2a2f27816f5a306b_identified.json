Depletions were simulated by the Phase-Two Elkhorn-Loup Model (ELM), constructed using MODFLOW-2005 (Harbaugh, 2005) with the Groundwater Vistas, version 5, software (Environmental Simulations, Inc., 2009). Each polygon represents one model grid cell. All values are estimates and approximations.  The Phase-Two ELM simulated the High Plains aquifer in north-central Nebraska from predevelopment (pre-1895) through 2055 (Stanton and others, 2010). The simulation was calibrated using an automated parameter-estimation method to optimize the fit of simulation outputs to three sets of calibration targets: estimated 1939 groundwater levels and base flows (representing pre-1940 conditions), 1945-through-2005 decadal groundwater-level changes, and 1940-through-2005 annual base flows. The calibrated simulation was used to estimate volumetric ratios of the reductions in base flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater storage to the total volume of water pumped from a hypothetical well for a 50-year future time period. Ratios were then multiplied by 100 to obtain percentages. The 50-year period was selected because base-flow depletion percentages for 40- to 50-year periods are the basis of groundwater and surface-water management decisions in Nebraska.</abstract>    <purpose>The purpose of this data set is to map the percentage of pumpage from a hypothetical well that causes reductions to base flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater storage in the Elkhorn and Loup River Basins during the 2006 through 2055 period. This data set also was published to facilitate replicability of the Phase-Two Elkhorn-Loup Model.</purpose>    <supplinf>Irrigated agriculture is vital to the livelihood of communities in the Elkhorn and Loup River Basins in Nebraska, and groundwater is the largest source of water used to irrigate cropland. Concerns about the sustainability of groundwater and surface-water resources have prompted State and regional agencies to evaluate the cumulative effects of groundwater irrigation in this area. Thus, in 2006, the U.S. Geological Survey, the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources, the University of Nebraska's Conservation and Survey Division, and the Lewis and Clark, Lower Elkhorn, Lower Loup, Lower Niobrara, Lower Platte North, Middle Niobrara, Upper Elkhorn, and Upper Loup Natural Resources Districts agreed to cooperatively study the water resources of these basins and to develop the ELM.   The initial part of that study, hereinafter referred to as \"phase one\", was a first step toward understanding long-term average conditions of the stream-aquifer system and developing strategies for management of hydrologically connected groundwater and surface-water supplies in the study area. Phase one, documented by Peterson and others (2008), mainly was limited to pre-existing data to develop a regional groundwater-flow simulation and predict the effects of groundwater irrigation on stream base flow in the Elkhorn and Loup River Basins.   Continuation of the study into a second phase was part of a larger, ongoing effort to enhance the knowledge of hydrogeologic characteristics, improve the understanding of stream-aquifer interactions, and compile reliable data describing groundwater system budget components such as groundwater recharge, groundwater pumpage for irrigation, and groundwater discharge to evapotranspiration in the study area. The phase-two study included updates to the groundwater-flow simulation using newly collected data and supporting analyses completed in 2007 and 2008 and advanced simulation calibration methods.  The newly collected data include revisions to the base-of-aquifer map based on test-hole drilling and surface and borehole geophysics (McGuire and Peterson, 2008), synoptic base-flow measurements along stream reaches (Peterson and Strauch, 2007), estimates of long-term recharge based on a runoff-recharge watershed model (Strauch and Linard, 2009), and geophysical mapping of resistivity patterns beneath canals (Teeple and others, 2009).   In addition to improving the data used for the simulations, advanced parameter-estimation techniques were used for phase-two simulation calibration, providing a more robust calibration. Other enhancements to the simulations included refining the grid discretization, using time-variable estimates of recharge from precipitation, time-variable base-flow estimates, improved estimates of groundwater withdrawals for irrigation, and refined delineation of areas where groundwater was actively evapotranspired.   For the phase-two study, a calibrated simulation described the stream-aquifer system from predevelopment through 2005, including predevelopment (pre-1895), early development (1895-1940), and historical development (1940 through 2005) conditions. The predevelopment-through-2005 simulation was calibrated using an automated parameter-estimation method to optimize the fit of simulated water levels and base flows to estimated 1939 groundwater levels and base flows (representing pre-1940 conditions), 1945- through-2005 decadal groundwater-level changes, and 1940-through-2005 annual base flows.   The calibrated simulation was used to estimate the percentage of hypothetically pumped volumes that would cause corresponding base-flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater-storage depletions over a 50-year future time period. Base-flow depletion percentages are of interest because they are used to guide the integrated management of surface water and groundwater in Nebraska. Mapped results of the base-flow depletion analysis conducted for most of the study area indicated that simulated pumpage of one additional hypothetical well over a future 50-year period generally would result in more than 80 percent of pumpage causing base-flow depletion when the well was located close to the stream, except in areas where base-flow depletions were partly offset by reduced groundwater discharge to evapotranspiration or reduced groundwater storage (lower water-table elevations). In many areas, base-flow depletion for the 50-year future period composed greater than 10 percent of the pumped water volume for a hypothetical well placed less than about 10 miles from the stream, though considerable variations existed because of the natural heterogeneity of the system represented by the simulation.   For a few streams, future simulated base flows declined substantially. For several small streams, simulated base flows in 2055 were absent. No further base-flow depletion occurred once simulated base flow was absent; therefore, base-flow depletion as a percentage of the volume pumped over 50 years declined from the time the simulated stream went dry until the end of the analysis period. Additional base-flow depletion as a percentage of pumping would be expected if base flow was present through 2055.

All calculations appeared accurate at time of publication. Estimated accuracy of the calculations is within 2 percent. Assumptions and uncertainties associated with the ELM contribute an unknown amount of error.</attraccr>   </attracc>   <logic>Each polygon represents a model cell and contains values indicating the estimated percentage of hypothetical volumetric well pumpage causing depletions to stream base flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater storage. All polygons were checked for closure errors. Values were checked to ensure they matched values in the utility program, were in proper format, and within acceptable ranges. The range of depletion values is 0.0 to 100.0 percent.   When a well begins to pump water, the source of that water is initially from storage. As pumping continues, the 3-dimensional zone of effect of the pumping well can expand, potentially causing increased inflow to the aquifer (such as from streamflow) and decreased outflow from the aquifer (such as to evapotranspiration or stream base flow). Base-flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater-storage depletions as a percentage of hypothetical pumpage were summed to verify that they did not exceed 100.0 percent. 4,973 grid cells were larger than 100.0 percent. The maximum value was 101.7 percent. Values greater than 100.0 percent are likely an outcome of compiling large amounts of rounded data. In addition, some depletion values near the edge of the ELM area could be affected by zero-flow boundary cells. The sum of base-flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater-storage depletions near the edges or outside of the Elkhorn and Loup Basins will be smaller than 100.0 percent because pumpage causes depletion to features located outside of the Elkhorn and Loup Basins. The sum also can be less than 100.0 percent near fixed-head boundary cells if the boundary cells are supplying water to the hypothetical well. Depletion values were not reported where calculations indicated that fixed-head boundary cells supplied 10 percent or more of the hypothetical pumpage volume.</logic>   <complete> This data set contains estimated base-flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater-storage depletions caused by pumping a hypothetical well in 22,208 grid cells within the ELM area, during the 2006 through 2055 simulation period only. This data set was produced from one of several simulated outputs for the ELM area.

Each cell was given a unique identifier that was the combination of its row and column location. The active simulation area, which is smaller than the extent of the model domain, encompasses 29,707 square miles and includes areas with an estimated aquifer saturated thickness of at least 10 feet.

Future pumpage and additional recharge applied to irrigated-cropland areas were estimated using 2005 land-use data and locations of irrigation wells registered with the Nebraska Department of Natural Resources during 2006, 2007, and 2008. Because future recharge from precipitation rates were unknown, recharge was held constant from 2006 through 2055 at the average 1940-through-2005 rates of recharge from precipitation, as determined during the calibration process.

Depletion values are reported for 21,911 grid cells.</procdesc>     <procdate>2009</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Calculated depletion values in the Access database were joined to the polygon shapefile of model grid cell centers in ArcMap, using an attribute join on the unique cell identifier.</procdesc>     <procdate>2009</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Data were re-projected to Nebraska State Plane Coordinates, with units of feet.</procdesc>     <procdate>2009</procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>   <direct>Vector</direct>   <ptvctinf>    <sdtsterm>     <sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype>     <ptvctcnt>21911</ptvctcnt>    </sdtsterm>   </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <planar>     <gridsys>      <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System 1983</gridsysn>      <spcs>       <spcszone>2600</spcszone>       <lambertc>        <stdparll>40.000000</stdparll>        <stdparll>43.000000</stdparll>        <longcm>-100.000000</longcm>        <latprjo>39.833333</latprjo>        <feast>1640416.666667</feast>        <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth>       </lambertc>      </spcs>     </gridsys>     <planci>      <plance>coordinate pair</plance>      <coordrep>       <absres>0.0010000</absres>       <ordres>0.0010000</ordres>      </coordrep>      <plandu>survey feet</plandu>     </planci>    </planar>    <geodetic>     <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>     <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips>     <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis>     <denflat>298.257222</denflat>    </geodetic>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <detailed>    <enttyp>     <enttypl> sir10-5149_FutDep</enttypl>     <enttypd>Percentage of hypothetical well pumpage causing depletions to simulated base flow, evapotranspiration, and groundwater storage in the Elkhorn and Loup River Basins for 2006-55, for 1-mile square model grid cells</enttypd>     <enttypds>U.S. Geological Survey</enttypds>    </enttyp>    <attr>     <attrlabl>FID</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef>     <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef>     <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>row</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Grid-cell row numbers locating the features in the model grid</attrdef>     <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey MODFLOW-2005</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <rdom>       <rdommin>15</rdommin>       <rdommax>149</rdommax>      </rdom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>column</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Grid-cell column numbers locating the features in the model grid</attrdef>     <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey MODFLOW-2005</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <rdom>       <rdommin>8</rdommin>       <rdommax>246</rdommax>      </rdom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>StrDep</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Base-flow depletion percentage for the 2006 through 2055 period caused by simulated pumpage of a hypothetical well in the respective model grid cell</attrdef>     <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <rdom>       <rdommin>0.0</rdommin>       <rdommax>100.0</rdommax>       <attrunit>percent</attrunit>      </rdom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>ETDep</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Evapotranspiration depletion percentage for the 2006 through 2055 period caused by simulated pumpage of a hypothetical well in the respective model grid cell</attrdef>     <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <rdom>       <rdommin>0.0</rdommin>       <rdommax>92.1</rdommax>       <attrunit>percent</attrunit>      </rdom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>StorDep</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Groundwater storage depletion percentage for the 2006 through 2055 period caused by simulated pumpage of a hypothetical well in the respective model grid cell</attrdef>     <attrdefs>U.S. Geological Survey</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <rdom>       <rdommin>0.0</rdommin>       <rdommax>97.8</rdommax>       <attrunit>percent</attrunit>      </rdom>     </attrdomv>    </attr>   </detailed>  </eainfo>  <distinfo>   <distrib>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>     </cntorgp>     <cntpos>Ask USGS -
