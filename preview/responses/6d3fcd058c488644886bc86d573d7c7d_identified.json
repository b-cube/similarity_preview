This partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states protects more than one million acres of estuarine land and water, which provides essential habitat for wildlife; offers educational opportunities for students, teachers and the public; and serves as living laboratories for scientists. NOAA provides funding, national guidance, and technical assistance. Each reserve is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university, with input from local partners. NERR System Wide Monitoring Project (SWMP) The National Estuarine Research Reserve System-wide Monitoring Program tracks short-term variability and long-term changes in estuarine waters to understand how human activities and natural events can change ecosystems. It provides valuable long-term data on water quality, water nutrient levels, and weather at frequent time intervals. Coastal managers use this monitoring data to make informed decisions on local and regional issues, such as \\ufffd\\ufffdno-discharge\\ufffd\\ufffd zones for boats and measuring the success of restoration projects. The reserve system currently measures physical and chemical water quality indicators, nutrients and the impacts of weather on estuaries. As the program expands, plans include adding a biological monitoring component and tracking changes in land use through remote sensing. North Inlet \\ufffd\\ufffd Winyah Bay Reserve\\ufffd\\ufffds Weather Monitoring Program The North Inlet Estuary and the adjacent lower northeastern section of Winyah Bay Estuary were designated as part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System in 1992. The North Inlet - Winyah Bay (NIW) Reserve is managed/hosted by the University of South Carolina, Belle W. Baruch Institute for Marine and Coastal Sciences, at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory. Its environmental monitoring program began running under the auspices of the NERR program in June 1993. In 1995, the NERR program began a System-Wide Monitoring Program that set protocols for monitoring the estuarine environment, starting with water quality. Collection protocols for weather data were being developed and implemented in 1997, at which time the NIW reserve\\ufffd\\ufffds data collection procedures changed to follow these new guidelines. Official SWMP weather protocols were implemented in 2001. Weather data collected under the NERR program are a continuation of the Baruch Institute\\ufffd\\ufffds long-term meteorological data set, which began in 1982, with rainfall data extending back into 1978. The NIW NERR weather station is located at the end of the Oyster Landing pier. The station includes sensors for air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active solar radiation (PAR, collected by a LiCor Quantum sensor), barometric pressure, wind speed, wind direction, solar radiation (Eppley black and white pyranometer, wavelengths between 280 and 2800 nm), and precipitation. All sensors are located on an aluminum tower at a height of approximately 3.5 meters (with the exception of the rain gauge, which is adjacent to the boardwalk) and are wired into a Campbell Scientific CR10X data logger. The data logger program, provided by the NERR Centralized Data Management Office (CDMO), determines and implements the data collection schedule. Readings are taken every 5 seconds continuously throughout the year and various average, instantaneous, and total data are reported for 15-minute, hourly, and 24-hour time intervals. Over the course of this database, there were protocol changes in data collection and reporting.
