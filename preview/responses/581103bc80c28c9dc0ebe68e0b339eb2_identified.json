CFRP parts may be molded to near net-shape geometry; however, machining operations are often necessary to provide final shape.  Edge trimming by the milling process is commonly employed to provide required surface finish and dimensional accuracy and can be performed wet or dry.  CFRP does not machine similar to ductile metals as the chip formation mechanism consists mostly of a series of brittle factures by shearing of the fibers and matrix where ductile metals produce a uniform chip through plastic deformation.  In dry machining, CFRP produces powder like chips or dust which are electrically conductive and currently classified as a nuisance particulate.  Further machining challenges of CRFP include delamination, fuzzing, fiber pullout, and short tool life due to the inhomogeneity of the material and abrasive nature of the fibers. In this work, experimental studies were performed to determine methods best suited to analyze dust particles generated from machining of composite materials.  Data was initially collected using cascade impactors where mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) was found to be .12 \\ufffd\\ufffdm - .35 \\ufffd\\ufffdm when machining at 0o to 135o of fiber direction without using local exhaust ventilation.  Real-time particle analysis instruments were introduced into the test protocol which demonstrated the ability to reduce sampling times from greater than 6 minutes to as short as 30 seconds without the need of an additional 48 hours of filter conditioning.  Dust profiles where found consistent between six real-time instruments evaluated for this application including four used in a unique isokinetic configuration designed specifically for dust analysis of particle producing manufacturing processes. A major development from this research is a process to safely and completely analyze all dust produced from machining of carbon fiber laminates using isokinetic sampling of particles as they travel from the work piece to a dust collection system with short sample times.  This is a significant improvement over existing methods which involve open air sampling or recovering dust from vacuum filters.  Dust was analyzed using both cascade impactors and with parallel use of real-time instruments.  Dust concentrations from typical edge trimming conditions were found to exceed permissible limits of 5 mg/m3 for nuisance dust at the source, thus meriting the use of fully self-contained systems for collection and analysis.  Supporting analysis tools were developed that enable comparison of dust concentrations reported by different instruments and measured gravimetrically. A method to determine cutting force at the cutting edge and cutting coefficients used in a mechanistic model for cutting force prediction of multi-directional composite laminates was also demonstrated.  In this method milling force cutting coefficients are empirically determined for all cutting orientations using a series of milled semi-circular slots that incorporate the effects of fiber orientation in unidirectional laminates.  In limited testing, linearity was found with a correlation coefficient greater than .99 using tangential forces from a rotating dynamometer for determination of tangential and edge milling coefficients and an average of .77 using radial force for radial and edge coefficients.

The work described herein includes the development of two software toolkits: one that implements functions for anatomical modeling based on distance fields, and one for registration of 3D (volumetric) medical imaging with 2D imaging (including stereo pairs). In both cases, the general aim of the research effort was to provide practical support for creating and simulating anatomical models with greater accuracy and efficiency; the specific goals involved applications of interest of a research group focused on understanding the biomechanics of the human foot. Thus, the distance-based tools were employed for purposes such as enhancing an existing finite-element model of the foot by identifying appropriate locations for cartilage elements that cannot be reliably resolved from typical imaging studies. The primary application described for the 2D-3D registration toolkit involves high-accuracy markerless tracking of the kinematics of the bones in the foot during walking gait. In both cases, GPU-based parallelism was found to have a significant impact on software execution time for data-intense applications and succeeded in realizing gains in computational efficiency of 10- to 150-fold over traditional CPU-based computing. The ramifications of such a radical increase in raw computing power are many, but possibly one of the most important outcomes for the group is the ability to rapidly and accurately quantify bone motion in the human foot during gait. Moreover, this research will deepen our understanding of foot bone motion as it relates to subjects exhibiting both normal and abnormal (i.e., deformities) foot conditions. Previous attempts at engaging in studies involving a large subject pool were stifled by prohibitively long software execution times; however, the GPU-based image processing tools developed in this dissertation will enable our group to revisit the once impractical investigation. While the human foot is the anatomical region of choice for studies described in this dissertation, the tools presented can be adapted to other anatomical localities in the body, such as the knee, hip, hand or shoulder. Additionally, this toolbox need not be limited to the human anatomy, opening the door to efficient exploration of animal models. Simulation of anatomically correct models can help investigators to more accurately predict physiological function, diagnose disease, and analyze environmental impact, which may lead to higher success rates during treatment and recovery. The GPU-based tools presented in this dissertation will provide the foundation for future work in the field of computational biomechanics by arming investigators with resources that encompass particularly relevant parallel computing tools. The intent is to provide an intuitive and interactive environment for efficiently modeling and manipulating highly complex biological geometry.

Unlike the current SHM system, the proposed SHM system has only a sensor unit and a drive unit, a low-power source to operate the system, and requires no heavy weight memory unit to record data. For the ferroelectric-film-based sensor unit, a polarization fatigue measurement system is developed and a numerous sets of polarization fatigue tests on ferroelectric films with millions of repetitions are conducted. The polarization fatigue data of the ferroelectric thin films provide the reduction of their polarization under a certain number of cyclic electric fields. For the drive unit, a bulk piezoelectric ceramic is mounted on a structural component sending out voltage, which is induced by the deformation on the structural component. By electrically connecting the drive unit to the sensor unit and an interface circuit in between, we utilize the polarization fatigue data of ferroelectric-film-based sensor unit to record only a critical number of cycles of a dynamic load history of larger magnitudes. The proposed SHM system is verified by a numerous sets of random-amplitude dynamic tests, which demonstrate that the proposed SHM system performs reliable accuracy for counting cycles, whose amplitude is larger than a specific value. To protect the fragile piezoelectric ceramic based drive unit, we analyze the reduction of stress if the piezoelectric patch is mounted on a structural component with an adhesive layer in between. We develop a theoretical model to analyze the elastic and viscoelastic behaviors of the load transfer design statically as well as dynamically. Finite element analysis is conducted to verify the accuracy of the theoretical model.

Mean velocity, turbulence intensity, coherent turbulent kinetic energy, and Reynolds shear stresses are used to identify regions of turbulence and mixing. The shear layer between the turbine wake and bypass flow resembles a rectangular ring near the turbine which grows into a larger oval downstream. Mixing allows the wake to recover to roughly 70% of the free stream velocity at five diameters downstream. The results of this study gives future researchers a map to locate areas of interest for more in depth research. Thesis (Master's)--University of Washington, 2014 </summary> </entry> </feed> ",
