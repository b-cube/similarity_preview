FIRMs also provide a basis for establishing flood insurance coverage premium rates offered through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  These maps were published as paper documents, which have been scanned into image files (TIFF) as part of FEMA&apos;s FIRM modernization process. This is one of three scanned maps for the Seaside-Gearhart area - 410030 0001 D, 410032 0001 C, and 410032 0002 C - that were georeferenced for the probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment project.</abstract> <purpose> This data set is one of a collection of digital files of a geographic information system of spatially referenced data related to the Seaside, Oregon, Tsunami Pilot Study.  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Federal Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) guidelines do not currently exist for conducting and incorporating tsunami hazard assessments that reflect the substantial advances in tsunami research achieved in the last two decades (Tsunami Pilot Study Working Group, 2006). Therefore, as part of FEMAs Modernization Program, a Tsunami Pilot Study was carried out in the Seaside/Gearhart, Oregon, area to provide information from which tsunami mapping guidelines could be developed. This area was chosen because it is typical of coastal communities in the section of the Pacific Coast from Cape Mendocino to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. There was also considerable interest shown by state agencies and local stakeholders in mapping the tsunami threat to this area. The study was an interagency effort by scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the University of Southern California, and the Middle East Technical University. We present the GIS data from that report in this publication.  These data are intended for science researchers, students, policy makers, and the general public.  The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information. </purpose> <supplinf> The following explanatory text was transcribed from Flood Insurance Rate Map 410027 0019 B,  Clatsop County (Unincorporated Areas), revised June 16, 1999 (FEMA, 1999).  Elevations referenced to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD29).  Zone A: Areas of 100-year flood; base flood elevations and flood hazard factors not determined.  Zone A0: Areas of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet; average depths of inundation are shown, but no flood hazard factors are determined.  Zone AH: Areas of 100-year shallow flooding where depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet; base flood elevations are shown, but no flood hazard factors are determined.  Zone A1-A30: Areas of 100-year flood; base flood elevations and flood hazard factors determined.  Zone A99: Areas of 100-year flood to be protected by flood protection system under construction; base flood elevations and flood hazard factors not determined.  Zone B: Areas between limits of the 100-year flood and 500-year flood; or certain areas subject to 100-year flooding with average depths less than one (1) foot or where the contributing drainage area is less than one square mile; or areas protected by levees from the base flood. (Medium shading)  Zone C: Areas of minimal flooding. (No shading)  Zone D: Areas of undetermined, but possible, flood hazards.  Zone V: Areas of 100-year coastal flood with velocity (wave action); base flood elevations and flood hazard factors not determined.  Zone V1-V30: Areas of 100-year coastal flood with velocity (wave action); base flood elevations and flood hazard factors determined. </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1981</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-123.941049</westbc> <eastbc>-123.918417</eastbc> <northbc>45.981637</northbc> <southbc>45.948457</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>none</themekt> <themekey>probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment</themekey> <themekey>tsunamis</themekey> <themekey>coastal geology</themekey> <themekey>PTHA</themekey> <themekey>tsunami probability</themekey> <themekey>tsunami hazard</themekey> <themekey>FEMA FIRM flood insurance rate map</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>environment</themekey> <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey> <themekey>oceans</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>Geographic Names Information System</placekt> <placekey>Seaside, Oregon</placekey> <placekey>Gearhart, Oregon</placekey> <placekey>Oregon</placekey> <placekey>USA</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>GEOnet Names Server</placekt> <placekey>north Pacific Ocean</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None.</accconst> <useconst> The data, digital results, GIS layers, and map products in this database have been created specifically as part of a pilot study for FEMA&apos;s modernization of Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) project. The results of the pilot study are intended to help FEMA draft new guidelines related to tsunami flooding for Coastal Flood Hazard Analysis and Mapping for the Pacific Coast of the United States.  The results are intrinsically probabilistic and designed according to FEMA flood zone specifications: annual probabilities of exceedance of 1% and 0.2%.  The data, digital results, GIS layers, and map products are not intended for other uses.  In particular, the 1% and 0.2% annual exceedance probability tsunami flood maps are not to be used for emergency planning, evacuation, or other insurance purposes.
