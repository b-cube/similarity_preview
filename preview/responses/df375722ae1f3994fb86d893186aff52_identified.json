The datasets in this series represent the following component polygon layers: Hydrometric Areas with Coastline, Hydrometric Areas without Coastline, Groups, Sections, and Catchments. Each layer represents a different level of spatial detail. The coarsest level, Hydrometric Areas, is provided in two versions to meet differing user needs. Each Hydrometric Area is made up of one or more Groups. Each Group carries a name constructed from names of the major river flowing through the Group, the major river flowing into the Group, the major river into which the Group flows, and in some cases also from local county names. Each Group is made up of smaller units called Sections. A Section is the drainage area of a watercourse between two confluences. Only confluences of named watercourses were considered. Similarly to Groups, each Section carries a name constructed from names of the major river flowing through the Section, the major river flowing into the Section, and the major river into which the Section flows. Catchments represent the full area upstream from an outlet of every Section. Polygons within each layer do not have gaps and, with the exception of Catchments, polygons within one layer do not overlap. Identifiers and attributes have been calculated so that direct upstream and direct downstream units within the same layer and also related units across layers can be easily selected. The Hydrometric Areas with Coastline layer covers Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but all other layers currently cover Great Britain only as no dataset with river geometries and names with suitable detail is available for Northern Ireland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>watershed</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>section</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>group</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometric area</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-05T15:15:20Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/10d419c8-8f65-4b85-a78a-3d6e0485fa1f\">     <title>Integrated Hydrological Units of the United Kingdom: Catchments</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/10d419c8-8f65-4b85-a78a-3d6e0485fa1f</link>     <description>This dataset is part of Integrated Hydrological Units (IHU) of the UK, a set of geographical reference units for hydrological purposes including river flow measurement and hydrometric data collection.

Hydrometric Areas are the coarsest units of the IHU in terms of spatial resolution. This dataset represents the same entities as the Hydrometric Areas with Coastline. The coastline of Hydrometric Areas without Coastline follows the boundaries of the CEH Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model, from which IHU were derived, while the coastline used in Hydrometric Areas with Coastline was derived from Ordnance Survey data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>catchment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>watershed</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-30T13:26:30Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5ff7f210-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (1km percentage target class, GB) Web Map Service v1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5ff7f210-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>This view shows a 1km resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Great Britain.

The series of LCM2007 products includes vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-15T14:54:22Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5d324260-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (1km percentage aggregate class, GB) Web Map Service v1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5d324260-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>This is a web map service (WMS) for the Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007), percentage cover at 1km for aggregate classes. Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom. The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors.  It also covers Northern Ireland and incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets. LCM2007 was classified using a hierarchical nomenclature corresponding to Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompasses the entire range of UK habitats. In addition, it recorded further detail where possible , incorporating land cover classes sought by other users. LCM2007 is produced in both vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.  This WMS is for Great Britain only.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-15T13:40:21Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/987544e0-22d8-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (25m raster, GB) web map service V1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/987544e0-22d8-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>This view service shows the 25m resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Great Britain.

The strata were created from the multivariate analysis of 75 environmental variables, including climatic data, topographic data, human geographical features and geology data.  The Land Classification has provided a stratification for successive ecological surveys (the Countryside Survey of Great Britain), the results of which have characterised the classes in terms of botanical, zoological and landscape features.  Additionally, the Land Classification can be used to stratify a wide range of ecological and biogeographical surveys to improve the efficiency of collection, analysis and presentation of information derived from a sample.  There are three versions of the Classification available. 1. The 1990 version containing 32 classes, which was the first to classify all 240,000km squares in Great Britain (building on an earlier 1978 version based on a sample of squares only).  2. A 1998 version, when the Land Classification was adjusted to 40 classes as a consequence of the need to provide National Estimates (from Countryside Survey 2000) for habitats for Scotland in addition to GB as a whole. 3. In 2007, the Land Classification was adjusted once again, to 45 classes, as a consequence of the need to provide Wales-only estimates in addition to those for Scotland and GB as a whole (from Countryside Survey 2007).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Bio-geographical regions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land classification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ITE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Institute of Terrestrial Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-05T13:34:37Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/362bff26-d2ca-4700-b1f0-22072f4bc0cc\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1984  mapped estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/362bff26-d2ca-4700-b1f0-22072f4bc0cc</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1984 in a vector format. The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 384 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths per 1km square for 7 different feature categories within 45 different land class types, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.  The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-04T14:14:07Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/271d398c-29de-4ff9-ba68-1b8e0621c6ee\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1984 estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/271d398c-29de-4ff9-ba68-1b8e0621c6ee</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1984.
