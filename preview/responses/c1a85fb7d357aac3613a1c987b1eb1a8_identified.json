Iodine-131 was measurable in grass samples across the country with activity concentrations ranging from 10 to 55 Bq per kg dry matter. Concentrations were similar to those reported in other European countries.  Rainwater and some foodstuffs were also analysed from a limited number of sites. Of these, I-131 was only detectable in sheep's milk (c. 2 Bq/kg). Caesium-134, which can be attributed to releases from the Fukushima reactors, was detectable in six of the grass samples (4-8 Bq/kg dry matter); 137Cs was detected in a larger number of grass samples although previous release sources (atmospheric weapons test and the 1986 Chernobyl and 1957 Windscale accidents) are likely to have contributed to this.  All data and information for this sampling are available from this record. The data result from collaboration between CEH and the University of Stirling.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>March-May 2011</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Fukushima</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Japan</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC04023</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>foodstuffs</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>I-131</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>caesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-04T15:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
