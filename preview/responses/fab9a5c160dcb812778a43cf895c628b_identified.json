Abstract: The thesis describes a programme of research work to develop and apply knowledge mapping and knowledge management techniques to effectively assess and enhance sustainability within urban redevelopment projects. The research programme was initiated in collaboration with Dundee City Council to support sustainable&#xD; development in a major programme of urban redevelopment. There is limited&#xD; evidence that the body of knowledge arising from research in sustainable urban&#xD; development is being holistically integrated within real life decision making practices to operationalise sustainability. Sustainability assessment has the potential to influence decision making and consequently by improving sustainability assessment&#xD; practice project decision making should be enhanced. In addition, closer integration&#xD; between assessment and decision making may not only lead to improve decisions,&#xD; but also to the improved learning of those involved. This can be greatly facilitated by&#xD; knowledge management, which can be used to understand and then facilitate greater&#xD; learning amongst stakeholders.&#xD; A theoretical framework for the assessment, monitoring and enhancement of&#xD; sustainability was developed and applied in two parts to a case study, a monitoring&#xD; component and an enhancement component. As a result of the case study a&#xD; sustainability assessment and monitoring framework was successfully established for&#xD; Dundee Waterfront in line with the assessment component of the theoretical&#xD; framework. The indicators are now used by Dundee City Council at project and&#xD; departmental level, providing the link across policies, programmes and projects. The&#xD; key challenge addressed in developing the benchmark indicators was establishing&#xD; robust governance for the monitoring framework. An enhancement framework was&#xD; successfully established for Dundee Waterfront in line with the enhancement&#xD; component of the theoretical framework. Decision mapping and knowledge&#xD; elicitation techniques were successfully developed and applied to the case study to identify, key points in decision process, the information decision makers' need and&#xD; which knowledge objects are being used in decision making.&#xD; It is concluded that the knowledge elicitation and mapping approaches applied were&#xD; effective at identifying both existing processes and knowledge objects used in&#xD; infrastructure provision. This allowed a Knowledge Map for Sustainability to be&#xD; developed to identify what information is currently used to influence sustainability and&#xD; identify future opportunities to enhance practise. The map was effective in capturing&#xD; the role of each stage in the process towards translating the sustainability vision as&#xD; proved by user verification. The Map showed for the first time the aspects of&#xD; sustainability in infrastructure provision and can be used to systematically&#xD; operationalise sustainable development. However, the use of the map to embed&#xD; sustainability into learning process could not be verified by practise in the currency of&#xD; the thesis. A limitation of the case study application is that the integrated&#xD; sustainability assessment and enhancement framework has been applied in a&#xD; Scottish local authority context, to an organisation with a Quality Management&#xD; System and outcome based indicators. These factors have been identified as&#xD; contributing factors to the success of the sustainability assessment and&#xD; enhancement framework as applied in the case study. This has the potential to limit&#xD; the exportability of any findings. However, whilst considering the monitoring&#xD; component it is recognised that similar outcome based indicators may exist at other&#xD; local authorities and private organisations. In addition, the knowledge elicitation and&#xD; mapping technique is an adaptive framework and as such is designed to respond to&#xD; other organisation structures. Therefore by its nature it should be exportable to other&#xD; applications. However three main questions remain to be addressed prior to the&#xD; research question being answered in full. Firstly, uncertainty related to governance&#xD; and long term use of the framework. Secondly, testing how the Knowledge Map for&#xD; Sustainability is used in practice and thirdly the exportability of findings from the case study. It is recommended that these limitations be addressed in future work.</description>     <dc:date>2014-03-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10373/1941\">     <title>The interaction of fingermark deposits on metal surfaces and potential ways for visualisation</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10373/1941</link>     <description>Title: The interaction of fingermark deposits on metal surfaces and potential ways for visualisation Authors: Wightman, Graham; Emery, F.; Austin, C.; Andersson, I.; Harcus, L.; Arju, G.; Steven, C. Abstract: The interaction of fingermark deposits on metals has been examined by a variety of techniques. Visualisation by film growth has been the main area of investigation through: thermal oxidation, anodising, peroxide solution, and the interaction with vapour of iodine and ammonium sulphide. Corrosion of the underlying metal has also been examined as an alternative means of visualisation.&#xD; &#xD; Confocal microscopy was used to look at the film thickness and corrosion products around the prints. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersion of X-rays (SEM-EDX) examined a number of metal samples to investigate film growth and the elemental distribution. The observations suggest that differential oxidation was occurring as well as corrosion into the metal. Fingermark deposits on metals can corrode into the metal depending on the reactivity of the metal and leave a recoverable mark. However, fingermark deposits can also alter the rate of chemical reaction of the substrate metal by oxidation. In some cases organic matter can inhibit reaction, both when forming an oxide layer and when corroding the metal. However, signs of third level detail from pore contact may also be visible and the monovalent ions from salts could also influence film growth.&#xD; &#xD; Whilst further work would need to be carried out to decide whether any of these techniques may have application in fingermark recovery, this study does suggest that fingermarks on metals may be recoverable after incidents such as fires or immersion in water.</description>     <dc:date>2015-04-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10373/1940\">     <title>An investigation into using neuro-evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) for short term load forecasting (STFL)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10373/1940</link>     <description>Title: An investigation into using neuro-evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) for short term load forecasting (STFL) Authors: \\ufffd\\ufffdzveren, C\\ufffd\\ufffdneyt S\\ufffd\\ufffdheyl; Sapeluk, Andrew; Birch, Alan Abstract: Different ANN architectures using back propagation can forecast the electricity demand at half-hourly intervals for up to 24 hours ahead with various degrees of success that is highly dependent on mainly trial and error heuristic tailoring of the architecture and the various learning parameters to cover the solution space. This paper presents the results of an investigation of an approach in the neuro-evolution technique to the short term electricity forecasting (STFL) problem. This algorithm is called Neuro-Evolution through Augmenting Topologies (NEAT). We have chosen the methodology in the paper to be a simple, generic, adaptive, robust, and easy to implement approach, requiring modest computing resources, for the prediction of the electricity demand.</description>     <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10373/1939\">     <title>A multi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcentre study of adults with learning disabilities referred to services for antisocial or offending behaviour: demographic, individual, offending and service characteristics</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10373/1939</link>     <description>Title: A multi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcentre study of adults with learning disabilities referred to services for antisocial or offending behaviour: demographic, individual, offending and service characteristics Authors: O'Brien, Gregory; Taylor, John; Lindsay, William R.; Holland, Anthony; Carson, Derek; Steptoe, Lesley; Price, Karen; Middleton, Claire; Wheeler, Jessica Abstract: This study was carried out as part of a larger study commissioned by the UK Department of Health to investigate the service pathways for offenders with learning disabilities (LD). The study covered three health regions in the UK and included 477 people with LD referred to services because of antisocial or offending behaviour during a 12\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmonth period. Data were collected concerning demographic, individual, offending behaviour and service characteristics. The findings of the study are broadly consistent with contemporary research concerning this population, particularly in relation to the nature and frequency of offending, history of offending, psychopathology, age and gender distribution. However, very few of those referred had any form of structured care plan, despite having significant offending histories, and this may have compromised early identification of their needs and communication between the health, social and other services involved.</description>     <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
