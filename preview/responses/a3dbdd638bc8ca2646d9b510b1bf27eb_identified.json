We are committed to the furtherance of English as a subject and to fostering the highest standards in its teaching and learning.</p> <p><strong>What are our concerns?</strong> We believe that good English teaching is under threat for a number of reasons. The pace of change in education in recent years has been considerable and seems set to continue. Much teaching and learning is at present being driven chiefly by what can be assessed and is distorted by the pressures of accountability, rather than being shaped by what is educationally desirable for pupils.</p> <p>At <strong>Primary</strong> level there is widespread concern among teachers that the phonics and grammar tests for 7 and 11 year-olds are inefficient and imprecise ways of assessing children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds literacy standards, to the extent of being positively harmful to our youngest childrens\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experiences of reading. The tests which 11 year olds are required to take continue to have a negative effect in the English curriculum, particularly in Year 6 where \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdteaching to the test\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd inevitably takes place.</p> <p>At <strong>Secondary</strong> level the recent reforms to GCSE examination introduced in the name of making both assessment and demand more rigorous are leading to an unforeseen and undesirable narrowing of the curriculum as early as KS3. As schools begin to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdteach to the test\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd as early as Year 9 or even before, there will be an impoverishment in pupils\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experience of both reading and writing. The study of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcanonical\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd texts is important, but its new prominence devalues other forms of literary and linguistic experience. Pupils will have much less time for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdreading for pleasure\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and they will thereby be deprived of access to the range of high-quality writing which exists for children and young adults. The exclusion of media and multi-modal texts, and the reduced emphasis on speaking and listening threaten to deprive pupils of skills and knowledge which are vital in the contemporary world. The absence of any kind of coursework assessment at GCSE also restricts pupils\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd opportunities for the independent work, personal research and extended writing, which are essential to undergraduate study and future employability.</p> <p>At <strong>Advanced</strong> level, the decoupling of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdA\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAS\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd poses acute logistical problems for schools and colleges. Whilst Cambridge University has issued advice to schools advocating the retention of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdAS\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd for all, the new system is not designed to serve this purpose. The full ramifications of the current reforms have been so far inadequately understood.</p> <p>In the<strong> training and recruitment of teachers</strong>, there is currently a shortage of graduates with a specialist qualification in English. Recently introduced arrangements surrounding the training of teachers are fundamentally incoherent, involving different routes, sometimes leading to different qualifications, and embodying different aims and different experiences. The application process is complex and confusing. The current situation needs rationalisation.</p> <p>In short, initiatives have been introduced quickly. They have involved major upheavals and are now issuing in unforeseen consequences. We think that at this time there is need for policy-makers to develop a coherent overview of the position of English in schools and universities. Fresh policy for any new government needs to be based on a full awareness of all the issues involved either in the further implementation or in the halting of these reforms.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>hl11</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-19T14:51:54Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/march/fields-of-flowers-2013-a-visit-to-western-sichuan-china\">     <title>'Fields of flowers \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd a visit to western Sichuan, China'</title>     <link>http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/march/fields-of-flowers-2013-a-visit-to-western-sichuan-china</link>     <description>Knoll House in the Botanic Garden - 25 Mar 2015, 10:30AM - 11:30AM</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Some of the great plant hunters of the 19th and 20th centuries travelled in China and in particular in Western Sichuan, from where they brought back to Europe a range of exciting new plants.\\ufffd\\ufffd This illustrated talk will show a variety of plants in their native habitats, high in the mountains, in a region adjacent to Tibet.\\ufffd\\ufffd This proximity to Tibet means that many of the people share the Tibetan culture and this is shown in the appearance of their houses and religious buildings.</p> <p>To be given by Dr Mary Walmsley on Wednesday 25 March at 10.30am at the Knoll House in the Botanic Garden.</p> <p>Please park on Glebe Road, and enter the Knoll through the main door  off the driveway.

While science does not recognize national boundaries, the seismological work that has been undertaken in the UK since at least the time of Robert Hooke and the founding of the Royal Society is peculiarly amenable to presentation at an Institute of Physics History of Physics Group sponsored meeting.</p> <p>The meeting has been divided into four sessions; Earthquakes, Instruments and Institutions, Controlled Source Seismology and Crustal Studies, and Passive Seismology. To ensure the content is not just a reflection of science past, the sessions include topics that highlight outstanding current work, and speakers have been asked to consider future trends in their particular field.</p> <p>Twenty-two speakers will cover such varied topics as Early British Thinking on Earthquakes, Prediction, Quiet Earthquakes, Test-ban Verification, Schools\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Seismology, Seismic Investigations of the Ocean Floor, Seismology and the Oil and Gas Industry, Tomography and the Outer Earth, Anisotropy, Interferometry and Seismic Noise, Helioseismology, and more.</p> <p>The meeting will take place over two days, posters being displayed throughout.

The Jamaican government recognises that reggae is something they need to support, but much of this is nothing more than rhetoric.\"</p> <p>Harper's roots lie in the reggae music industry. The founder of Jamstar Productions, an entertainment marketing firm that has worked with some of Jamaica\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds premier artists, Harper has worked across the world supporting names such as the Skatalites, Chakademus &amp; Pliers, Diana King, Nadine Sutherland, Patra and Lady Saw.</p> <p>The\\ufffd\\ufffddocumentary will have a Birmingham dimension as the city\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds own reggae star Yaz Alexander is helping him with research material.
