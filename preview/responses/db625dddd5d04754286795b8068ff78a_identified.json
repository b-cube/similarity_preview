In summary, data were collected through face to face interviews with respondents who had previously answered the FRS and who had agreed to be followed up. Separate surveys were run in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  The sampling details for each are provided below.  Sampling Procedures Great Britain The PSE sample consists of respondents who participated in the 2010/11 Family Resources Survey (FRS) and gave permission to be re-contacted for further research.  FRS 2010/11 was conducted between April 2010 and March 2011 (although some interviewing will have been conducted up to June 2011 given that each month a field period of around 8 weeks operated).  The FRS was used as a follow-up sample for PSE so that the information collected on both studies could be used in combination.  The FRS provides a wealth of information about living standards and has the benefit of drawing on detailed factual information on income and other topics such as employment, health, childcare, informal care.  PSE questionnaire content which focuses on attitudes about living standards thus adds to the information collected on FRS.  Analysing FRS in combination with PSE provides a large amount of data without the need to re-collect full income in time-consuming detail.  This cost-effective approach also had the benefit of allowing PSE content to focus on the aims of the study without over-burdening the respondent with an exceptionally long interview, should it have been necessary to re-collect the FRS questionnaire content afresh.   The 2010/11 FRS survey year was chosen because it was the study which would be completed and available as a final dataset at the point at which PSE fieldwork would finish.   The FRS also provided a large amount of information on non-respondents to the follow-up PSE survey which facilitated accurate non-response re-weighting of the final data.   As PSE was following up FRS respondents it was possible to select a sample on the basis of known characteristics.  The sample was selected to take account of differences in income and to allow analysis which compares differences between ethnic groups and between rural and urban areas.  It was possible to boost the sample in Scotland and Northern Ireland to ensure that national comparisons within the United Kingdom could be made.  As there were insufficient Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) in Wales in a single year\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds FRS it was not possible to boost the sample for Wales.  FRS fieldwork is conducted by NatCen and the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  Sample was selected from NatCen data sources for the majority of cases and ONS sample was used primarily for ensuring the boost sample (for ethnicity and rural Scotland) cases were sufficiently enumerated.  A selection of FRS households was made based on the Household Reference Person or Partner in each household having agreed to be re-contacted for a follow-up study.    Northern Ireland  PSE (NI) 2012 involved re-contacting people who took part in the NI Family Resources Survey (FRS) between January 2010 and March 2011 and who gave permission to be contacted again regarding a follow-up study. Of the 2484 households who took part in the NI FRS between January 2010 and March 2011, 1702 included households where at least one adult member of the main Benefit Unit (either the Household Reference Person or their partner, where applicable) gave permission at the FRS interview to be contacted regarding a follow-up study. These 1,702 households then formed the sample for PSE (NI) 2012.  The aim of the study was to achieve an interview in person with all adults (i.e. those aged 18 and over) in the household. We went back to respondents from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) because PSE (NI) 2012 will be used in combination with FRS data. This will provide a wealth of information about living standards and has the benefit of drawing on the detailed income information and other employment, health, childcare, informal care and other background information collected on FRS without the need to re-collect these details. To account for changes in respondents\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd circumstances since they were last interviewed on FRS, the respondent was asked, in the PSE (NI) 2012 study, whether certain circumstances had changed. This will allow this household\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds information to be updated when the FRS data and PSE (NI) 2012 are combined. The focus of the questions asked in the PSE (NI) 2012 study will then be on the respondent\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds assessment of their living standards and can explore a range of other issues relating to deprivation and social exclusion, including physical and mental health, crime and social harm, education, school exclusion, experience of employment, access to services, social and civic participation and social networks. </collMode>         <sources />       </dataColl>     </method>     <dataAccs>       <setAvail>         <accsPlac>UK Data Service</accsPlac>       </setAvail>       <useStmt>         <contact>&lt;a href=\"mailto:dave.gordon@bristol.ac.uk\"&gt;David Gordon, &lt;/a&gt;</contact>       </useStmt>     </dataAccs>     <othrStdyMat />   </stdyDscr> </codeBook>",
