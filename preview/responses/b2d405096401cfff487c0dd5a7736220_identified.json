All these were aspects of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdstorage structures\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that enabled social and nutritional value to be&#13; saved, accumulated and later mobilised. In addition, there were investments in the land, landesque&#13; capital, which secured future food surpluses and so provided an alternative to food storage, in a region&#13; where the staple foods were mostly perishable, yams excepted, and food preservation was difficult.&#13; Landesque capital included such long-term improvements to productivity as terraces, mounds, irrigation&#13; channels, drainage ditches, soil structural changes and tree planting. These investments provided an&#13; effective alternative to food storage and made possible surplus production for exchange purposes. As an&#13; example, in the New Georgia group of the western Solomon Islands irrigated terraces, termed ruta, were&#13; constructed for growing the root crop taro (Colocasia esculenta). Surplus taro from ruta enabled inland&#13; groups to participate in regional exchange networks and so obtain the shell valuables that were produced&#13; by coastal groups. In this paper, we reconstruct how this exchange system worked in New Georgia using&#13; ethno-archaeological evidence, we chart its prehistoric rise and post-colonial fall, and we outline the&#13; factors that constrained its long-term expansion.

The delivery of ecosystems services and conservation of biodiversity relies on the control of rural land for the provision of public benefits. Much has been written about the progress of neoliberalisation, typically implying that land management decisions are increasingly being left to market forces. However, less has been made of the areas in which the state has extended its control over land or where freehold rights have been attenuated. At the same time, there are intimations that the neoliberal hegemony may be waning. This paper explores approaches to the governance of rural land beyond the neoliberal agenda, drawing particularly on two cases: the proposals for the privatisation of the Public Forest Estate in England and the subsequent recommendations of an Independent Panel on Forestry, and the emergence of Large Conservation Area initiatives introduced by non-governmental organisations. It is important to recognise that the crafting of institutions determines the mix of private and public values of land and the incentives for management. We focus particularly on three important elements of governance. Institutional blending relates to the ways in which property rights area spread amongst different interested parties. These arrangements identify the residual claimant that bears the risk and final return from land holding. Ultimate oversight of property use requires public trust to be identified. Research is needed on the operation of these institutions in practice. Governments will need to develop approaches to be able to define and promote public values in rural land uses.

This paper analyzes the politics and struggles ongoing within wildlife management areas&#13; (WMAs) in Tanzania to discuss the dynamics of neoliberalization of the wildlife sector.&#13; We discuss neoliberalization as a new political-economic context within which the&#13; ongoing politics of natural resource management are played out, and focus on green&#13; grabbing as an expression of these politics. We discuss how local-level actors are&#13; engaged in these processes, often in strategic ways, to negotiate their roles within&#13; WMAs and address green grabbing by the state. Secondly, we discuss an example of&#13; the politics of land control and local-level actors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd enactment of accumulation by&#13; dispossession within a WMA.

S.; Sutherland, William J.; Vickery, Juliet A. The Sahel in West Africa is a major wintering area for many western Palearctic migrants.&#13; The breeding populations of many of these have declined over the past 50 years. However, there&#13; have been few intensive field studies on migrant ecology in the Sahel and these were generally&#13; within a very restricted area. Consequently our knowledge of the distribution of species within&#13; this extensive area and the habitat associations of these species is limited. Understanding these&#13; habitat associations is essential for the effective conservation management of populations. We brought&#13; together a group of experts and consulted a wider group by email to assess the main Sahelian&#13; habitat types used by 68 African-Eurasian migrant bird species. Those species that showed strongest&#13; declines during 1970\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1990 were associated with more open habitats than those newly declining&#13; during 1990\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2000, when declining species were associated with habitats with more shrubs and&#13; trees. Populations of species that winter in the Sahel are generally stable or increasing now as&#13; rainfall has increased and is now near the long-term average for the Sahel. Those which use the&#13; Sahel only as a staging area are, in many cases, in rapid decline at present.
