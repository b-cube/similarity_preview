The authors also briefly discuss how the microeconomic evidence and a number of aggregation and composition problems might help explain the ambiguous results in this literature.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                     <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Bermuda Islands</geogCover>             <geogCover>Canada</geogCover>             <geogCover>Czech Republic</geogCover>             <geogCover>Estonia</geogCover>             <geogCover>Finland</geogCover>             <geogCover>France</geogCover>             <geogCover>Germany</geogCover>             <geogCover>Hungary</geogCover>             <geogCover>Japan</geogCover>             <geogCover>Luxembourg</geogCover>             <geogCover>Mexico</geogCover>             <geogCover>Netherlands</geogCover>             <geogCover>Norway</geogCover>             <geogCover>Spain</geogCover>             <geogCover>Sweden</geogCover>             <geogCover>Switzerland</geogCover>             <geogCover>United Kingdom</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                            </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>                    </dataColl>       <notes>                 The zipped package contains a Microsoft Excel file that includes data, tables, and figures corresponding to the published article.         </notes>                  <notes>                 These data are part of ICPSR's Publication-Related Archive and are distributed exactly as they arrived from the data depositor.
