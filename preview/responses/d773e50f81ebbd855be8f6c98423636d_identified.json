The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a 7.5&#45;minute quadrangle format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties. </abstract>    <purpose>SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.</purpose>    <langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata></descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>1998</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>publication date</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>In work</progress>    <update>As needed</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>&#45;102.5</westbc>     <eastbc>&#45;94.6</eastbc>     <northbc>40.0</northbc>     <southbc>37.0</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>geoscientificInformation</themekey>     <themekey>soil survey</themekey><themekey>Soil Survey Geographic</themekey><themekey>SSURGO</themekey></theme>   </keywords>   <accconst>none</accconst>   <useconst> The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source. This is public information and may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps for purposes related solely to state or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data. </useconst>   <ptcontac>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service</cntorg>     </cntorgp>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>      <address>760 South Broadway</address>      <city>Salina</city>      <state>KS</state>      <postal>67401&#45;4642</postal>      <country>USA</country>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>785&#45;823&#45;4558</cntvoice>    </cntinfo>   </ptcontac>   <native>Arc/Info</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>   <logic> Datasets delivered to the Data Access and Support Center are quality assurance tested for major   documentation and topological errors using macros.  The databases are evaluated based on questions similar to the following: Does the database's documentation properly explain the dataset? Does the data import properly into its native dataset environment? Is consistent methodology used throughout the data? Are all of the database's fields and values legitimate compared to the documentation? Is the database's topology free of errors that could impair the functionality of the data?  Once the data is tested a report is written describing the evaluation.  A copy of the report is then forwarded to the data originator for his/her review.  If errors are found, the data originator is expected to make any necessary corrections and then provide those corrected coverages.  After these steps have been taken data is considered archivable and made available for distribution.  Data that is archived by DASC has been tested and corrected. </logic>   <lineage>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>See specific soils survey metadata.</origin>       <pubdate>See specific soils survey metadata.</pubdate>       <title>See specific soils survey metadata.</title>      </citeinfo>     </srccite>     <srcscale>See specific soils survey metadata.</srcscale>     <typesrc>See specific soils survey metadata.</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <sngdate>        <caldate>See specific soils survey metadata.</caldate>       </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>See specific soils survey metadata.</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea>See specific soils survey metadata.</srccitea>     <srccontr>See specific soils survey metadata.</srccontr>    </srcinfo>    <procstep>     <procdesc>See specific soils survey metadata.</procdesc>     <procdate>See specific soils survey metadata.</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep><procdesc Sync=\"TRUE\">Metadata imported.</procdesc><srcused Sync=\"TRUE\">C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\battles\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\xml14A8.tmp</srcused><date Sync=\"TRUE\">20040413</date><time Sync=\"TRUE\">15421700</time></procstep></lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>   <direct>Vector</direct>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <planar>     <planci>      <plance>coordinate pair</plance>      <coordrep>       <absres>0.61</absres>       <ordres>0.61</ordres>      </coordrep>      <plandu>Meters</plandu>     </planci>     <gridsys><gridsysn>Universal Transverse Mercator</gridsysn></gridsys></planar>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover>See specific soil survey metadata.</eaover>    <eadetcit>See specific soil survey metadata.</eadetcit>   </overview>  </eainfo>  <distinfo>   <distrib>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>Data Access and Support Center</cntorg>     </cntorgp>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>      <address> University of Kansas 1930 Constant Avenue, West Campus </address>      <city>Lawrence</city>      <state>KS</state>      <postal>66047&#45;3726</postal>      <country>USA</country>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>785&#45;864&#45;3965</cntvoice>     <cntfax>785&#45;864&#45;5317</cntfax>     <cntemail>dasc@kgs.ku.edu</cntemail>     <hours>0800&#45;1700</hours>    </cntinfo>   </distrib>   <distliab> The State of Kansas Geographic Information Systems Core Database's digital data have been tested and their documentation carefully reviewed.
