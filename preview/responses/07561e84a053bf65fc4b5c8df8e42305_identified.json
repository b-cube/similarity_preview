As the earth has cooled and warmed, ice fields have advanced and</p>       <p begin=\"00:00:30.00\" end=\"00:00:40.05\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">receded.  During warming periods, ice melts and water expands, causing <br/>sea-level rise.</p>       <p begin=\"00:00:40.05\" end=\"00:00:45.06\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Scientists are studying how sea-level rise may affect coastal wetlands. A</p>       <p begin=\"00:00:45.06\" end=\"00:00:50.13\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">key study site is The Mississippi River Delta, which is experiencing high</p>       <p begin=\"00:00:50.13\" end=\"00:00:58.26\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">rates of relative sea-level rise due to rapid land subsidence.</p>       <p begin=\"00:00:58.26\" end=\"00:01:02.26\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">What is subsidence and how does it relate to sea-level rise?</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:02.26\" end=\"00:01:06.53\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: Subsidence is the process of sinking to a lower level. Sediment</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:06.53\" end=\"00:01:10.79\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">deposited by the river undergoes subsidence due to compaction and</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:10.79\" end=\"00:01:15.41\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">dewatering. As water and gases are squeezed out of spaces between soil</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:15.41\" end=\"00:01:21.06\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">particles, soft sediment compacts. As the sediment compacts, subsidence</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:21.06\" end=\"00:01:26.72\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">occurs and the land gradually sinks.  Buildings and other structures also</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:26.72\" end=\"00:01:33.61\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">sink along with the soil surface. The other process contributing to land</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:33.61\" end=\"00:01:37.07\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">loss is sea-level rise. As global temperatures rise and land based ice</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:37.07\" end=\"00:01:44.47\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">melts, oceans expand. As ocean volume expands, sea level rises globally.</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:44.47\" end=\"00:01:50.05\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">This is known as eustatic sea-level rise. Relative sea-level rise is the</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:50.05\" end=\"00:01:54.97\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">combination of eustatic rise in sea level and land movement and is unique</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:54.97\" end=\"00:01:59.73\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">for each location. The combination of the two processes determines the</p>       <p begin=\"00:01:59.73\" end=\"00:02:02.51\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">rate of submergence in each coastal area.</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:02.51\" end=\"00:02:06.51\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Why is the Mississippi River Delta subsiding?</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:06.51\" end=\"00:02:10.67\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: The Louisiana coast is a dynamic system, built in part by the</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:10.67\" end=\"00:02:17.37\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">action of the Mississippi River.  To understand how subsidence affects</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:17.37\" end=\"00:02:22.93\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">the Mississippi River Delta and its wetlands, we first have to go back a <br/>few thousand years.</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:22.93\" end=\"00:02:27.29\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Because glaciers were melting 8,000 years ago, sea levels were higher at</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:27.29\" end=\"00:02:32.80\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">that time, so much of the present day coast was under water.  Where New</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:32.80\" end=\"00:02:37.38\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Orleans is located today was also under the sea.  Sea level continued</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:37.38\" end=\"00:02:43.82\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">rising forming a bay that would ultimately become Lake Pontchartrain.</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:43.82\" end=\"00:02:47.66\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Sea-level rise then slowed and the river began building up sediments</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:47.66\" end=\"00:02:53.01\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">along the coast.  Scientists call these deposits, delta lobes. Additional</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:53.01\" end=\"00:02:56.93\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">delta lobes were formed as the river switched from east to west and back</p>       <p begin=\"00:02:56.93\" end=\"00:03:01.25\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">again.  When the river switched to a new course, the abandoned lobe began</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:01.25\" end=\"00:03:06.36\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">to deteriorate-a process that caused formation of barrier islands.  The</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:06.36\" end=\"00:03:10.31\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">last area to form is what is now the modern delta.</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:10.31\" end=\"00:03:14.52\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">This cycle of land building followed by deterioration and rebuilding is a</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:14.52\" end=\"00:03:18.78\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">natural part of the delta cycle, which has created a vast expanse of</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:18.78\" end=\"00:03:23.29\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">marshes, swamps, and barrier islands.</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:23.29\" end=\"00:03:27.21\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">The river periodically overflowed its banks each spring delivering</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:27.21\" end=\"00:03:31.53\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">sediments to the coastal marshes and swamps. Then, Europeans arrived on</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:31.53\" end=\"00:03:36.28\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">the scene and established New Orleans in a bend of the Mississippi River.</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:36.28\" end=\"00:03:43.03\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">To prevent flooding of New Orleans, levees were built.  And these were extended as the city grew.</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:43.03\" end=\"00:03:46.45\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Then in the 1920s, there were catastrophic floods such as the great flood</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:46.45\" end=\"00:03:53.38\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">of 1927.  Disastrous flooding prompted the construction of levees, which</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:53.38\" end=\"00:03:58.10\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">eventually extended the entire length of the lower part of the river.</p>       <p begin=\"00:03:58.10\" end=\"00:04:02.77\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Levees prevented natural sediment delivery to wetlands in the delta.</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:02.77\" end=\"00:04:07.77\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Instead, sediment was shunted offshore into deep water and the wetlands,</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:07.77\" end=\"00:04:11.95\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">sitting atop compacting sediment, began deteriorating.</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:11.95\" end=\"00:04:16.42\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">What other factors have caused wetland loss?</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:16.42\" end=\"00:04:19.73\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: Scientists attribute a portion of wetland loss to direct and</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:19.73\" end=\"00:04:23.54\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">indirect effects of canals, which were built for navigation as well as</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:23.54\" end=\"00:04:28.37\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">for access to oil and gas wells.  Material was dredged from the wetland</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:28.37\" end=\"00:04:33.94\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">and deposited in spoil banks along the canals. These spoil banks acted</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:33.94\" end=\"00:04:38.26\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">like levees blocking natural tides and currents and generally altered the</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:38.26\" end=\"00:04:43.45\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">hydrology, increasing the depth and duration of flooding.</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:43.45\" end=\"00:04:51.07\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">How does flooding affect wetland plants?</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:51.07\" end=\"00:04:54.37\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: Wetland plants must tolerate periodic flooding.  When a plant</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:54.37\" end=\"00:04:58.68\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">establishes in a well-drained soil, the pore spaces between soil</p>       <p begin=\"00:04:58.68\" end=\"00:05:04.78\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">particles are filled with oxygen.  Upon flooding, however, soil pores</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:04.78\" end=\"00:05:09.51\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">become filled with water, and respiration of microorganisms uses up</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:09.51\" end=\"00:05:14.92\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">oxygen faster than it can be replaced.  Thus, flooded soils have little</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:14.92\" end=\"00:05:19.89\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">or no oxygen.  Plants tolerate such low-oxygen conditions by developing</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:19.89\" end=\"00:05:23.64\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">special air-space tissue inside the roots called aerenchyma, which</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:23.64\" end=\"00:05:27.85\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">creates an internal aeration pathway that allows oxygen in the atmosphere</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:27.85\" end=\"00:05:36.04\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">to reach the roots.  This is one mechanism that allows plants to survive</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:36.04\" end=\"00:05:39.17\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Although wetland plants are adapted for growth in flooded soils,</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:39.17\" end=\"00:05:43.26\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">excessive flooding causes stress and lowered productivity.  Over time,</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:43.26\" end=\"00:05:48.85\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">the vegetation thins and dies out, leaving ponds that coalesce forming</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:48.85\" end=\"00:05:55.14\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">open water behind the spoil banks, which ultimately subside and disappear.</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:55.14\" end=\"00:05:59.91\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Don't hurricanes destroy wetlands?</p>       <p begin=\"00:05:59.91\" end=\"00:06:03.30\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: Storms and hurricanes can also damage wetlands, causing</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:03.30\" end=\"00:06:08.61\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">shoreline erosion, burial with wrack, which smothers vegetation, and</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:08.61\" end=\"00:06:14.17\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">other impacts.  However, hurricanes may also deliver nourishing sediment</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:14.17\" end=\"00:06:18.69\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">that counterbalances subsidence.  Hurricane Katrina, for example,</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:18.69\" end=\"00:06:22.61\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">delivered several centimeters of sediment to coastal marshes, raising</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:22.61\" end=\"00:06:28.41\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">soil elevations and re-invigorating marshes.</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:29.21\" end=\"00:06:33.87\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Evidence of sedimentation from prehistoric hurricanes can be seen in</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:33.87\" end=\"00:06:37.94\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">cores collected from coastal marshes, indicating that storm sediments</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:37.94\" end=\"00:06:42.14\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">have also contributed to accretion in the past.</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:42.14\" end=\"00:06:46.75\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">What about saltwater intrusion?</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:46.75\" end=\"00:06:50.74\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: Rising sea level can also bring saltwater farther inland. A</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:50.74\" end=\"00:06:54.52\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">common misconception, however, is that all wetland plants are harmed by</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:54.52\" end=\"00:06:59.49\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">saltwater.  In fact several coastal plant species are tolerant of sea-</p>       <p begin=\"00:06:59.49\" end=\"00:07:03.32\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">strength salinity due to special morphological and physiological</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:03.32\" end=\"00:07:08.79\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">adaptations.  For example, the extensive salt marshes in the coastal zone</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:08.79\" end=\"00:07:12.27\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">are dominated by a plant, which grows well in saltwater, called smooth</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:12.27\" end=\"00:07:17.11\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">cordgrass.   Another species common to the coastal fringe is the black</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:17.11\" end=\"00:07:21.44\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">mangrove.  These species have salt glands in their leaves, which excrete</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:21.44\" end=\"00:07:42.20\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">salts onto the leaf surface where they crystallize.</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:42.20\" end=\"00:07:46.21\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">This is just one of several special mechanisms allowing such species,</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:46.21\" end=\"00:07:50.25\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">known as halophytes, to thrive in saltwater.</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:50.25\" end=\"00:07:54.10\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Other species common to coastal marshes have lower tolerances of</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:54.10\" end=\"00:07:58.09\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">saltwater-these are found in intermediate and brackish habitats where</p>       <p begin=\"00:07:58.09\" end=\"00:08:02.33\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">they grow well under low to moderate salinity levels.</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:02.33\" end=\"00:08:05.79\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">The most sensitive plants are found in freshwater wetlands.  The species</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:05.79\" end=\"00:08:10.35\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">here can be killed by sudden pulses of saltwater.  However, depending on</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:10.35\" end=\"00:08:14.80\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">the duration of exposure and other factors, the community may recover</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:14.80\" end=\"00:08:17.62\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">from seeds contained in the seed bank.</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:17.62\" end=\"00:08:22.08\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">What, then, is the cause of wetland loss?</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:22.08\" end=\"00:08:25.92\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Narrator: The causes of wetland loss are complex and not the result of a</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:25.92\" end=\"00:08:30.48\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">single factor.  Instead, wetland loss is the consequence of multiple</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:30.48\" end=\"00:08:35.16\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">interacting natural and human-induced factors such as subsidence</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:35.16\" end=\"00:08:38.54\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">associated with the deltaic cycle and the leveeing of the Mississippi</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:38.54\" end=\"00:08:43.57\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">River, in combination with regional and global changes such as sea-level</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:43.57\" end=\"00:08:47.74\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">rise and climate change.  One thing is certain. The Mississippi River</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:47.74\" end=\"00:08:52.24\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">Delta is a dynamic system that has undergone dramatic changes over its</p>       <p begin=\"00:08:52.24\" end=\"00:08:58.24\" tts:textAlign=\"center\">geologic history and will likely continue to change in the future.</p>     </div>   </body> </tt> ",
