It is the fourth year running that the zoo has been the most popular paid-for attraction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo enjoyed record visitor figures with the last four months of 2014 all being record-breakers. January and February this year have continued the theme smashing previous visitor records.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s managing director, Jamie Christon, said:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;2014 ended on a real high with the busiest year in our history and we&amp;rsquo;re off to a flying start in 2015. Time and again the zoo excels in delivering a great day out for its visitors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This year is a ground-breaking year for the zoo too with the opening of our new development Islands. It&amp;rsquo;s the biggest zoo development of its kind in Europe providing a window on the world of conservation in South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/islands\"&gt;Islands&lt;/a&gt;, which opens in June, will recreate habitats from six areas in South East Asia - Panay, Papua, Bali, Sumatra, Sumba and Sulawesi - and provide a home for a number of animals classed as critically endangered in the wild, including Sumatran tigers, Sumatran orangutans and Visayan warty pigs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jamie added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islands will drive visitor figures up even further and bring the zoo to a whole new audience. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more pleased with where we are at today and have a lot to look forward to this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About Islands at Chester Zoo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Islands is the biggest and most ambitious zoo project in UK history &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Work began in August 2013 &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; It is set to open in June 2015 &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; It is currently one of the biggest construction sites in the UK &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Visitors will move through recreations of habitats from Panay, Papua, Bali, Sumatra, Sumba and Sulawesi, walking through different levels, travelling in boats and seeing buildings just like the real thing. It will create the feeling of an expedition and make visitors feel like they&amp;rsquo;re following in the footsteps of the great explorers &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The Lazy River Boat Journey will feature 14 boats, carrying 238 visitors at any one time, on a 15-minute-long trip&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; 42,000 plants will be used to recreate the environments of the six different islands &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The flagship indoor building that will be part of Islands will be called the Monsoon Forest &amp;ndash; the largest indoor zoo exhibit in the UK. It will be totally unique in this country and will feature free flight birds, Sumatran orangutans, macaques and Sunda gharial crocodiles &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Other animals include anoa, banteng, babirusa, Bali starling, cassowary, Indonesian wrinkled hornbill, lorikeet, Sumatran tiger and the Visayan warty pig &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The zoo hopes that by showcasing animals like this then visitors seeing animals in an even more naturalistic setting than ever before will make more of an emotional connection with them.

They&amp;rsquo;re one of the rarest pig species on the planet and so our new little arrival is a significant addition to the world&amp;rsquo;s population.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Years of planning and preparation have gone into us being able to successfully breed babirusa here. Matano is important for the future of the species and so we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to bits with her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; We hope that, one day, Matano will grow up to become a vital part of the international breeding programme which is working to safeguard the species by ensuring there&amp;rsquo;s a healthy, viable back-up population in the event that they disappear from the wild.     &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Babirusa piglet Matano - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/babirusa/Babirusa piglet Matano (10).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Matano was born in early December and, in the weeks and months since, keepers have kept a watchful eye on her and mum in a special behind-the-scenes area.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, however, the proud mum and playful youngster are ready to make their first public appearances.    &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Rowlands added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Babirusa are a sensitive species and we needed to give mum and baby plenty of quiet time to bond. Majene is a great, experienced mother &amp;ndash; very protective and extremely watchful over her piglet. Little Matano doesn&amp;rsquo;t leave her side. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of the zoo&amp;rsquo;s five babirusa will move to a brand new exhibit when Islands, the biggest and most ambitious expansion project in UK zoo history, opens in June.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islands will recreate habitats in the Philippines, Bali, Sulawesi, Papua, Sumba and Sumatra and see visitors set off on their own conservation expedition. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Babirusa piglet Matano at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/babirusa/Babirusa piglet Matano (8).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Babirusa facts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Babirusa piglet Matano was born on 2/12/2014, following a 161 day pregnancy for her mum, Majene &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Dad is called Sausu   &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Chester Zoo is one of only a handful of zoos in the whole of Europe which has successfully bred the distinctive animals &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The species is endemic to the Sulawesi rainforests of Indonesia &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Babirusa are highly threatened and one of the rarest pig species on the planet &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; They are classed by conservationists as vulnerable to extinction in the wild &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; In the wild, the species has seen numbers plummet largely because of habitat loss through logging and hunting for their meat &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; They are members of the pig family but in Indonesia the name babirusa means pig deer after their unusual appearance, especially the males with their big curling tusks &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Babirusa feed on fruit, seeds, nuts, insects and fungi &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; In June 2015, the zoo&amp;rsquo;s babirusa will move to a brand new exhibit when Islands, the biggest development in UK zoo history, opens. Islands will recreate habitats from Panay, Papua, Bali, Sumatra, Sumba and Sulawesi and showcase species such Sumatran orangutans, cassowary, Sumatran tigers and Sunda gharial crocodiles, as well as babirusa. Unlike anything else in the UK, it will show animals in an even more naturalistic setting than ever before, which the zoo hopes will see visitors make more of an emotional connection with them.

We got a &amp;lsquo;maternity suite&amp;rsquo; ready for her with deep sandy floors and beds of hay but ultimately she chose her own spot.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The footage has enabled us to witness this really special moment and both mum and youngster are doing really, really well. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every birth is cause for great celebration but given that Eastern black rhino face a real threat of extinction our new arrival is even more significant. The calf is super important to the breeding programme in Europe and her arrival is another step towards sustaining a black rhino population which, in the wild, is being ravaged by poachers on an almost daily basis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the wild there are thought to be less than 650 Eastern black rhinos remaining, pushing the species perilously close to extinction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numbers in Africa are plummeting as a result of a dramatic surge in illegal poaching, fuelled by a global increase in demand for rhino horn to supply the traditional Asian medicine market. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The problem is being driven by the astonishing street value of rhino horn, which is currently worth more per gram than gold and cocaine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Baby rhino born at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/horses-and-rhinos/black-rhino/calf/DTrhino7.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Rowlands added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We put great effort into protecting black rhinos in the wild, supporting a number of sanctuaries across Africa. However, as the demand for rhino horn intensifies, poaching continues to become a bigger and bigger problem. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope that, one day, we can put an end to this crisis once and for all. But in the meantime we need to ensure we have an insurance population and that&amp;rsquo;s why this arrival is such brilliant news. This means there&amp;rsquo;s a very happy team of keepers, vets and conservationists here at Chester Zoo today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All being well, &lt;em&gt;Fara&lt;/em&gt; will also one day play her own breeding role in a programme, which, in some cases, has already seen some black rhinos return to Africa to help boost numbers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the time being though she is forging very important early bonds with mum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The calf is the latest in a long-line of arrivals at the zoo in the last two years, following &lt;em&gt;Chanua&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dakima&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Embu&lt;/em&gt;. She brings the total number of Eastern black rhinos at the zoo to 11.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Baby rhino with mum at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/horses-and-rhinos/black-rhino/calf/DTrhino6.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Baby rhino at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/horses-and-rhinos/black-rhino/calf/DTrhino5.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Black rhino notes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Kitani was born at Chester Zoo on 16/06/1997. She is 17-years-old&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Dad Sammy, 15, moved to Chester Zoo from Osaka in Japan in 2002. He currently lives at Port Lympne&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The female calf, which keepers have named Fara, is a second for Kitani who had Asani in 2008 &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Eastern black rhinos are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the conservation of Nature (IUCN)&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The number of black rhinos in Kenya plummeted from about 20,000 in 1970 to 597 (as at December 2010) &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo is one of the main organisations fighting for the survival of eastern black rhino and has long supported conservation efforts in the wild to try and protect black rhinos and continues to pump money, and provide expertise, to numerous sanctuaries in Africa&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The Chester ZooBlack Rhino Programmestarted in1999, in partnership with Save the Rhino, providing substantial financial support to Kenya Wildlife Service to enable the translocation of 20 black rhinos to wildlife reserves in the Tsavo region of Kenya&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;More recently we have also provided support for the rhinos in Chyula Hills National Park and Laikipia District in Kenya and Mkomazi in Tanzania&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Helping to ensure an insurance population exists in the event that black rhino become extinct in the wild; Chester Zoo has been successful in breeding a number of critically endangered black rhinos and plays a vital part in the international breeding programme&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Ground-breaking science by a team at Chester Zoo team has contributed to the zoo&amp;rsquo;s successful black rhino breeding programme. Zoo researchers have spent several years carefully monitoring the hormone levels of their resident female rhinos in a bid to discover the best time to introduce them to a potential partner. These hormone levels are monitored by analysing rhino dung. Tracking hormones gives an insight into what is going on inside the animals. It can help tell things like whether or not an animal is a seasonal breeder, whether it has reached puberty, whether it&amp;rsquo;s cycling on a regular basis or not and when the optimum time to introduce a male to a female is, as well as diagnose pregnancies and estimate when an animal will give birth.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{43B07126-0B1E-4B3A-9FE2-BA455BD17027}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/truckloads-south-east-asian-artefacts</link><title>Truckloads of South East Asian artefacts arrive at Chester Zoo</title><description>&lt;p&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTreasure trove\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of long boats, tuk-tuks and market stalls unloaded ahead of opening of biggest ever UK zoo development&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Islands artefacts being loaded\" src=\"/~/media/news/2015/islands-artefacts/IMG_0127.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of original South East Asian artefacts &amp;ndash; including long boats and tuk-tuks &amp;ndash; have arrived at Chester Zoo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Canoes, stall frontages, ploughs, mopeds and tools, sourced from all over South East Asia, are amongst the items to have been shipped from ports in Indonesia as the zoo prepares to unveil its new &amp;pound;30m Islands development in June.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islands, billed as the biggest building project in UK zoo history, will recreate habitats from Panay, Papua, Bali, Sumatra, Sumba and Sulawesi.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Tuk tuk \" src=\"/~/media/news/2015/WP_20150204_11_12_17_Pro.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Dr Maggie Esson and Kim Halliday\" src=\"/~/media/news/2015/islands-artefacts/IslandsShipment1-63.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Education programmes manager at Chester Zoo, Dr Maggie Esson, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a home delivery unlike any other. It&amp;rsquo;s a very special shopping list indeed - a real treasure trove of unusual bits and pieces all the way from South East Asia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of these amazing artefacts are destined for our new zone, Islands, which is about transporting people to another place &amp;ndash; making them feel like, for a few hours at least, they&amp;rsquo;ve stepped into South East Asia and are exploring that most incredible part of the planet. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re making it as authentic as we possibly can and that&amp;rsquo;s why we&amp;rsquo;ve done our shopping in places like Indonesia. As well as the animals, the landscaping and the architecture, it&amp;rsquo;s all of these details that will bring the place alive and create a truly authentic snapshot of the region.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The genuine old boats, tools, market stalls, fabrics and tuk-tuks will help us to tell the stories of what happens on these remarkable islands, including our vital field conservation work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A host of items, including three, three-tonne boats, were purchased directly from families in South East Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Longboat for Islands\" src=\"/~/media/news/2015/islands-artefacts/IslandsShipment1-60.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Esson added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of these items have a fascinating back-story. The boats, for example, used to belong to fishermen from Java in Indonesia. They&amp;rsquo;d use the boats daily, in good weather, fishing for skipjack, yellow fin tuna, snapper, king mackerel and sardines.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the money they&amp;rsquo;ve received for the boats they&amp;rsquo;ve now been able to buy better replacements to help improve the size of their catch and help them earn a better wage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islands will provide a home for a number of animals classed as critically endangered in the wild, including Sumatran tigers, Sumatran orangutans and Visayan warty pigs as well as over 50 other species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;About Islands at Chester Zoo&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Islands is a &amp;pound;30 million development project - the biggest and most ambitious zoo project in UK history&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Work on Islands began in August 2013&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;It is set to open in June 2015&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Currently one of the biggest construction sites in the UK&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Visitors will move through recreations of habitats from Panay, Papua, Bali, Sumatra, Sumba and Sulawesi, walking through different levels, travelling in boats and seeing buildings just like the real thing.

Thousands of animals, many of them endangered, are part of the compulsory count which is required by law as part of the zoo&amp;rsquo;s licence. The vital details of each and every individual are noted down so that the zoo can help worldwide breeding programmes. And as Chester prepares to open the biggest development in UK zoo history in spring, it has been a particularly busy year and a host of new exotic species need to be added to the records.

But, as the zoo prepares to unveil a &amp;pound;30m expansion in 2015, staff have their work cut out this time around with a whole host of exotic new arrivals to add to the records.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=\"video\"&gt;   &lt;iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Aw-_DNBT9bk?rel=0\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__top\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__right\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__bottom\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__left\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new development, called &lt;em&gt;Islands&lt;/em&gt;, is the biggest in UK zoo history and will recreate habitats from the Phillipines, Bali, Sulawesi, Papua, Sumba and Sumatra. Thousands of animals &amp;ndash; including bizarre species like dead leaf mantids, Javan humphead lizards and tentacled snakes - have already arrived at the zoo ahead of its opening next spring.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Aquarium team manager Andrea Swatman with one of Chester Zoo's tentacled snakes \" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/Aquarium team manager Andrea Swatman with one of Chester Zoos tentacled snakes 2.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Aquarium team manager Andrea Swatman with one of Chester Zoo's tentacled snakes&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herpetology keeper Heather Prince said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tallying up our new super-sized Asian forest turtles doesn't provide us with too much of a headache but trying to count the hundreds of stick insects or dozens of mantids is a bit more of challenge!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo&amp;rsquo;s records coordinator Liz Ball, responsible for compiling the data, added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Records at the zoo are regularly updated to allow for any births, deaths, departures and arrivals - with every animal having a 'passport' detailing exactly who it is, where it was born and who its ancestors are - ensuring the best possible management of vital worldwide conservation-breeding programmes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But it's all hands on deck as keepers help double check the data with a full head-count - a process which zoos must go through by law in order to comply with the Zoo Licensing Act 1981.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With so many new animals coming in to take up residence in our new Islands development, we&amp;rsquo;ve got an even bigger challenge than usual. Dozens of new species have arrived well in advance of its opening in spring 2015 and they&amp;rsquo;re already breeding well. It means there are a heck of a lot of new heads to count &amp;ndash; with the hundreds of weird and wonderful bugs being the trickiest!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an incredibly exciting time for the zoo though and, even though there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of extra work, it&amp;rsquo;s really nice to be able to add all of the wonderful new arrivals to the count.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The count is a process that zoos have to go through by law in order to comply with the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 and utilise the keeping staff to help in the process&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;2013 was the first year in which Chester Zoo added all of its insects to the count&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"A vampire crab waits to be counted\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/A vampire crab waits to be counted.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;A vampire crab waits to be counted&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"All that counting is a little tiring for one of Chester Zoo's Asiatic lionesses\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/All that counting is a little tiring for one of Chester Zoos Asiatic lionesses.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;All that counting is a little tiring for one of Chester Zoo's Asiatic lionesses&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Chester Zoo's curator of lower vertebrates and invertebrates, Dr Gerardo Garcia, with an Asian forest turtle\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/Chester Zoos curator of lower vertebrates and invertebrates Dr Gerardo Garcia with an Asian forest turtle.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Chester Zoo's curator of lower vertebrates and invertebrates, Dr Gerardo Garcia, with an Asian forest turtle&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Herpetology keeper Heather Prince with a male Hercules beetle\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/Herpetology keeper Heather Prince with a male Hercules beetle (1).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Herpetology keeper Heather Prince with a male Hercules beetle&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Herpetology keeper Philippa Carter-Jones with a one-week-old Borneo eared frog\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/Herpetology keeper Philippa Carter-Jones with a one-week-old Borneo eared frog (10).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Herpetology keeper Philippa Carter-Jones with a one-week-old Borneo eared frog&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/stocktake/Keeper Hayley compares the number of meerkats to the previous year at Chester Zoos annual animal count 1.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Keeper Hayley compares the number of meerkats to the previous year at Chester Zoo's annual animal count&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Keeper Karen Neech counts Chester Zoo's Humboldt penguins.

This operation will dramatically improve things for her, make her much more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;May&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tripa - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/year-in-pics/Tripa the baby Sumatran orangutan at Chester Zoo.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Primate experts at the zoo&lt;a href=\"/global/press-and-media/press-releases/dental-health-study-helps-wild-orangutans\"&gt; began a study on their orangutans' teeth&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to help conservation projects thousands of miles away in Malaysia and Indonesia, where the animals often need to be moved if they come into conflict with humans, or their habitat is threatened by deforestation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To decide if they can move the animals safely, conservationists need to know if they're old enough to live independently. Young orangutans are dependent on their mother for eight to nine years - longer than any other animal apart from humans. However it&amp;rsquo;s very difficult to tell the age of an orangutan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why keepers at the zoo started gathering new information on the emergence of teeth in their young orangutans &amp;ndash; to help improve age estimations of orangutans observed in the wild and orphaned orangutans in rehabilitation facilities in South East Asia, whose dates of birth are usually unknown.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rare that any zoo animals travel between Europe and the USA but Bernardo&amp;rsquo;s move brought important new blood to the European population of spectacled bears &amp;ndash; a species classed by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being vulnerable to extinction in the wild. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;July&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Python - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/year-in-pics/Python-17.ashx\" /&gt;

&amp;ndash; including using ultrasound to scan its heart.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reticulated pythons are the longest species of snake in the world so it took a team of 12 people to examine it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The huge reptile - named JF - is thought to be one of the largest of her kind in Europe weighing in at around 60kgs. &lt;/p&gt;

a rare species which is protected in the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project, in which each individual dormouse is microchipped, is providing important information on dormouse habitat use, life expectancy, population size and breeding behaviour which is helping to guide more effective dormouse conservation in the UK.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project has been running for 10 years making it the biggest study of its type to be carried out on a small mammal species in the UK. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;December&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure /&gt;

But we&amp;rsquo;re happy to report that our new, not-so-little, youngster is doing well and is already confident on her long legs.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Everyone at the zoo is thrilled with &lt;em&gt;Zahra&lt;/em&gt; and she has really added to our Christmas and New Year celebrations.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Giraffe-8.ashx?h=1202&amp;amp;w=800\" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The zoo now has a herd of eight Rothschild giraffes. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mr Rowlands added: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s great that we have a nice herd here, in the wild this species really is under threat. Numbers are declining at a worrying rate due to a massive upsurge in poaching for their meat.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;So when people come here and see the likes of &lt;em&gt;Zahra&lt;/em&gt; and see what magnificent animals Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s giraffes are, we really want them to stop and think about the plight of the species in the wild. Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s giraffes are of high conservation priority and the need for a concerted conservation effort has never been more urgent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On top of its successful breeding record, Chester Zoo has supported important projects in the wild, including the first ever scientific review of the Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s giraffe. Its aim is to develop a long-term conservation strategy for the species in Africa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rothschild giraffe facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Mum Aiofe was born on 1 March 1998. She is 16 years old&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Dad is called Meru&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The baby &amp;ndash; a female named Zahra - was born at around 3am on Dec 22. She is Aiofe&amp;rsquo;s second calf. &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Zahra means &amp;lsquo;flower&amp;rsquo; in Swahili&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s giraffe are named after zoologist Lord Walter Rothschild, founder of the National History Museum in Tring, Hertfordshire&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are also known as the baringo or Ugandan giraffe&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The species is identified by its broader dividing white lines and has no spots beneath the knees&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Giraffe population figures are declining across Africa&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s &amp;nbsp;giraffes are classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with current population estimates suggesting less than 1,100 remain in the wild&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;With less than 1,100 individuals remaining in the wild the Rothschild's giraffe is more endangered than species such as African elephants and giant pandas&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Roughly one-third of the surviving population of Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s giraffes live in zoos where carefully co-ordinated breeding programmes are creating a safety-net population for the species&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Once wide-ranging across Kenya, Uganda and Sudan, the Rothschild&amp;rsquo;s giraffe has been almost totally eliminated from much of its former range and now only survives in a few small, isolated populations in Kenya and Uganda&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The main threat to the species now is loss of habitat and poaching for meat and hides&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;In the past, giraffes were hunted for their tails, which were used as good-luck charms, sewing thread and even fly swats&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The species is one of the most endangered of the nine sub-species of giraffe&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo now has eight Rothschild giraffes &amp;ndash; &lt;em&gt;Meru, Aoife, Dagma, Orla, Tula, Kanzi, Millie&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Zahra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{F9165D53-4BEB-4256-8B7D-79764471F4E1}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/top-10-zoo-babies-2014</link><title>Chester Zoo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds top 10 babies of 2014</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo has seen a host of important animal births in 2014 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd including several \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdzoo firsts\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The zoo says careful planning, excellent husbandry, expert keeping staff, top facilities, a detailed animal nutrition programme and scientific underpinning are factors that have all come together to achieve their breeding bonanza.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the zoo&amp;rsquo;s list of the top 10 baby animal success stories of the year&amp;hellip;  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. Merida the Grevy&amp;rsquo;s zebra foal&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Zebra - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Zebra-3.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A rare Grevy&amp;rsquo;s zebra foal, a female named Merida, was born in February &amp;ndash; the first of its kind to be born at the zoo for over 30 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curator of mammals, Tim Rowlands, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since our female zebras arrived a few years ago we have worked very hard to breed this highly endangered species and the arrival of this foal is not only a really good achievement for us but also good news for the species as a whole.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo is part of a European breeding programme for the species which is the largest of all zebras and distinctive from its cousins given that it has the narrowest stripes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Jake the Viysayan warty pig&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Warty pig - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/WartyPig-12.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; An extremely rare piglet was born in May. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Given that the species boasts spiky, almost mohawk-like hair style on their heads, mum Viv and dad Sid were named after punk rockers Vivienne Westwood and Sid Vicious. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; And their new charge was given a title to follow suit &amp;ndash; Jake, after Jake Burns from the band Stiff Little Fingers.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Only 200 Visayan warty pigs are thought to be left in their native habitat in the Philippines &amp;ndash; making them the rarest of all wild pigs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Keeper Lucy Edwards said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Visayan warty pigs are critically endangered and face an extremely high risk of becoming extinct in the wild. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; They&amp;rsquo;ve suffered a drastic population crash in recent times with widespread commercial logging, illegal logging and agricultural expansion devastating vast amounts of their natural habitat. They&amp;rsquo;re also being over-hunted and their meat can often command at least double the price of domestic pork in local markets and some restaurants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; It really is a battle against time to save them.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Chester Zoo was the first in the UK to welcome Visayan warty pigs, a species that gets its name from three pairs of fleshy warts on the boar's face. The warts protect them from rival pigs' tusks during a fight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; 3. World Cup penguin chicks &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Penguins - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Penguins-12.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; When four Humboldt penguin chicks hatched in April a real poser for keepers was what to call them. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lead penguin keeper Karen Neech said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Choosing names for the chicks is always tricky but with one eye on this summer&amp;rsquo;s World Cup in Brazil, we decided to kick off this year&amp;rsquo;s football campaign with some stars of our own. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Footballers have very strict diets and things are just the same for our new arrivals. But whereas footballers can look forward to a protein shake ours grow strong on a diet of regurgitated &amp;lsquo;fish smoothie&amp;rsquo; provided by their parents. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step forward Rooney (named after England forward Wayne), Gerrard (after current England captain Steven), Banks (after 1966 World Cup winning goalkeeper Gordon) and Moore (after 1966 World Cup winning captain Bobby). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt; 4. The zoo&amp;rsquo;s first warthogs &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Warthog - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Warthogs-9 (2).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; In May, two warthogs also became the first of their kind to be born at the zoo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The piglets, who at the time stood at just 30cm tall, arrived to first time parents Tamzin and Magnum.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Curator of mammals, Tim Rowlands, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the zoo&amp;rsquo;s first ever warthog family and so of course we&amp;rsquo;re absolutely thrilled. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our tiny piglets are almost hairless, wrinkly and grey and already have their trademark protruding warts from which they get their name. Some may not consider them to be as &amp;lsquo;cute&amp;rsquo; as many of the other babies we&amp;rsquo;ve had born here of late, but to us, they&amp;rsquo;re just as special. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Unusual new arrival is a real pretty Polly &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Macaw - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Macaw-1.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keepers at the zoo provided around-the-clock care to a rare hyacinth macaw chick, named Jesse.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The baby bird was fed up to nine times a day in a Tupperware tub which acted as a crib.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The species is endangered in the wild where populations have undergone rapid reductions in recent years due to the illegal pet trade and habitat loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeper Karen Neech said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that our chick will eventually start to spring some beautiful deep blue feathers &amp;ndash; at the moment it looks more like a dinosaur crossed with a plucked chicken!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyacinth macaws are the world&amp;rsquo;s largest parrot and are found in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. Little humbug Zathras  &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Tapir at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Tapir-33.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Zookeepers announced the birth of a baby tapir in August.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tiny calf - the first male to be born at the zoo for eight years - was given the name Zathras. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curator of mammals, Tim Rowlands, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment Zathras looks a bit like a little humbug. His brown coat currently features lots of white stripes and spots which will eventually disappear as he gets to around six-to-nine months old. The markings act as camouflage in the wild &amp;ndash; mimicking speckled sunlight on the forest floor. He won&amp;rsquo;t be little for long though as new youngsters tend to double their weight in the first 14-21 days alone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo is a keen supporter of a conservation initiative which has been finding out valuable information about behaviour patterns and movements of tapirs in several key areas of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is hoped this research will help safeguard the future of the fascinating species which is increasingly hunted for its meat and for its hide, which is used to make sandals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Baby meerkats&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Meerkat - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Meerkats-14.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; A number of baby meerkats arrived mob-handed with litters born in April and August. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Team manager Dave White said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of the pups are full of rough and tumble. They&amp;rsquo;re a real handful for mum, dad and the other adults in the mob who, between them, are doing their best to keep them in check. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt; 8. Lasola the anoa calf &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Anoa at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Anoa-21.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; A &amp;lsquo;devilish&amp;rsquo; new arrival was born at the zoo on October 22.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The rare anoa calf &amp;ndash; the world&amp;rsquo;s smallest species of wild cattle &amp;ndash; arrived after a 282 day pregnancy for first time mum, Oana. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Keepers named the new female youngster, Lasola.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Anoa live in forests and swamps on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi but are listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with just 2,500 mature individuals estimated to remain. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Assistant curator of mammals, Dr Nick Davis, said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; In the wild they&amp;rsquo;ve been given the unfair tag as being &amp;lsquo;demons&amp;rsquo; of the forest. As a result they&amp;rsquo;re persecuted by farmers who hold them responsible for damage to their cattle. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Take one look at our new calf and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to see how anyone could label or harm them in such a way &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re a very shy and secretive animal.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt; 9. Sand lizards bred at the zoo return to sand dunes  &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Sand lizards - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Sand lizards reintroduced by Chester Zoo (4).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; Rare lizards, which were believed to have gone extinct in Wales around 60 years ago, were released on sand dunes in the north of the country in a bid to boost struggling populations.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The sand lizards - an endangered UK species - were bred at a number of specialist breeding centres, including the zoo, during the summer. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The captive breeding and reintroduction programme is helping the lizards to make a comeback in Talacre, North Wales. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Herpetology keeper Ruth Smith said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Sand lizards are the UK&amp;rsquo;s rarest lizard and populations in some areas are so low that we can&amp;rsquo;t just rely on protecting the site, we have to help breed them to boost their numbers. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This year we&amp;rsquo;ve reintroduced 31 juvenile lizards to the wild - a record for the zoo so we&amp;rsquo;re really pleased.   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Slowly and surely we&amp;rsquo;re getting them back into areas where historically they used to live. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt; 10. Gentle lemur birth is a first for zoo &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"GentleLemur - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/GentleLemur-12.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;A wide-eyed lemur marked yet another first for the zoo when it arrived in June. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new youngster &amp;ndash; an Alaotran gentle lemur - arrived to mum Molly and dad Fady.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curator of mammals, Tim Rowlands, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is a critically endangered species that is faced with a very real threat of extinction in the wild. This is the first time the species has ever bred at Chester Zoo and so we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; And who could forget&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.chesterzoo.org/attractions-and-exhibits/zoo-news/critically-endangered-ducklings-hatch-at-chester-zoo?page=4\"&gt;Baer's pochard ducklings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ducklings - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Ducklings-11.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"/global/press-and-media/press-releases/smallest-baby-deer-born\"&gt;Pudu fawn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Pudu - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Pudu-3 (2).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rock-hyrax-born\"&gt;Rock hyrax&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Rock hyrax - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/RockHyrax-4.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rare-monkey-born\"&gt;Buffy-headed capuchin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Capuchins - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Capuchins-17.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"/global/press-and-media/press-releases/dwarf-mongoose-pups-emerge\"&gt;Dwarf mongoose&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Mongoose - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Mongoose-6.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"/attractions-and-exhibits/zoo-news/rare-northern-bald-ibis-checks\"&gt;Northern bald ibis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Ibis - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Ibis-3.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=\"/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rare-african-crane-chicks\"&gt;West-African black-crowned crane chicks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Cranes - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/zoo-babies/Cranes-29.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{1798C7CF-0D4A-4242-924F-1DC05F500D24}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/chester-zoo-maasai-olympics</link><title>Chester Zoo sponsors the hunt for medals, not lions, at the Maasai Olympics</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo is to be the main sponsor of the 2014 Maasai Olympics \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd an event which is using sport to replace wildlife hunting as traditional warrior activity in East Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Maasai olympics\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Warriors compete in the Maasai Olympics.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The games, which will be held on December 13 at the Kimana Wildlife Sanctury at the base of Mt. Kilimanjaro in Kenya, are bringing a fresh approach to animal conservation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Killing animals to compete for recognition, display &amp;lsquo;manliness&amp;rsquo;, impress women and identify leaders has long been embedded in Maasai culture. However, conservationists fear it has reached a tipping point and has pushed certain species towards the brink of extinction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conservation experts, alongside spiritual leaders, village elders and leading Maasai figures have therefore worked together to develop the Maasai Olympics. Its aim is to stop the killing of animals and protect wildlife by showing Maasai warriors that there are other ways to display bravery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The individual athletic events &amp;ndash; based on traditional warrior skills &amp;ndash; will include the 200m sprint, 800m sprint, spear throwing, high jump and a 5k run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And, for the very first time, women will also compete in two events &amp;ndash; the 100 and 1500 meters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Warriors at Maasai olympics\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Warriors compete at the Maasai Olympics.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s education programmes manager, Dr Maggie Esson, will be travelling to the event to present the Chester Zoo Conservation Prize in recognition of the Maasai village (known as a manyatta) that has done the most for wildlife conservation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Esson said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Maasai Olympics has conservation at its heart. But it is a sports competition just like any other with winners and losers, close finishes and memorable victories.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The road to protecting species is never a straight one but we&amp;rsquo;re delighted to be a part of such a ground-breaking event.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medals, trophies and prizes, including cash and a premier breeding bull for the winning manyatta, will be given to the winners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kenyan Olympic gold medalist and world 800-metre record holder David Rudisha, a former Maasai warrior, will be the patron of the games.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{B668A753-487D-4BD8-B551-468FE8A6ADB9}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/new-dormouse-discoveries</link><title>New discoveries from a decade of dormouse diaries</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A unique decade-long study has unearthed fascinating new traits in a tiny mammal species. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Dormouse - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/dtmouse4.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;A female hazel dormouse is held by a member of the conservation team from Chester Zoo. The zoo is working with Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and the Wildlife Trusts to collect scientific data on the dormice \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd a rare species which is protected in the UK and Europe. The project, in which each individual dormouse is microchipped, is providing important information on dormouse habitat use, life expectancy, population size and breeding behaviour which is helping to guide more effective dormouse conservation in the UK. The project has been running for 10 years making it the biggest study of this type to be carried out on a small mammal species in the UK.  &lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ground-breaking research has shed new light on the mysterious hazel dormouse, including the fact that females have a promiscuous side. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conservationists took hair samples from the dormice and used DNA techniques to prove that females can have offspring sired by multiple fathers in the same litter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study - which is the largest and longest-running of its kind in the UK - is being carried out by conservationists from Chester Zoo, alongside staff from Natural Resources Wales (NRW), the local Wildlife Trusts, Denbighshire County Council and volunteers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It also found that female dormice can sometimes breed twice in the same year, and that very occasionally they breed before they are a year old. Both these behaviours have been observed in dormice in Europe, but rarely in the UK. In fact, breeding in &amp;lsquo;young of the year&amp;rsquo; had never been recorded in the UK before.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Chester zoo staff in the field\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/dtmouse8.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s biodiversity officer Sarah Bird said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our study has shed new light on the ecology of our dormice and highlighted factors which are important for their survival in the UK. Promiscuity in females had never been recorded before; and it will increase genetic diversity within litters, helping population survival. Equally important are the other breeding behaviours we have seen. It is likely that those years when females breed twice, and the young of the year also breed, is when populations can really increase. These behaviours are likely to be critical for healthy sustainable dormouse populations in the UK. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The scientific data collected is also providing important information on dormouse habitat use, life expectancy, and population changes, and helping to deliver more effective dormouse conservation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hazel dormice are protected under European law and the UK is required to monitor the species. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since recording began in the UK in the early 1990s, a decline in both the number of dormice, and the range of the species, has been observed. Experts believe the decline to have been taking place for at least 100 years due to loss and fragmentation of their habitat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2005, 45,000 hazel dormice were estimated to live in the UK. Today the national downward population trend continues though some evidence indicates the rate of decline may be slowing at last. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, at a site in Bontuchel in North Wales, the survey has revealed a large stable population of dormice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Dormouse field research\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/dtmouse11.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The hazel dormouse is a protected species in Europe and they&amp;rsquo;re super, charismatic little animals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our survey site in North Wales is on the very north western edge of their European range and, from the very start, we&amp;rsquo;ve been surprised by how many hazel dormice are there.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s a very important project and a very important site for study &amp;ndash; to understand why this woodland is so good for dormice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our vets and conservation team and project partners have been able to visit the site four times each year for the last 10 years. Using our veterinary expertise, we&amp;rsquo;ve marked 920 dormice with tiny microchips in that time. This has enabled us to build up a huge amount of really important and unique data. We now know a huge amount about these dormice now &amp;ndash; including how long they live, how their weight fluctuates throughout the year and how many survive winter hibernation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is clear that habitat management by Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is making a big difference. Leaving woodland unmanaged is not good for dormice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mike Whitley, local area manager for Natural Resources Wales, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have one of the healthiest populations of dormice in the UK here at Bontuchel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The coppice management works we carry out each year creates the just the right habitat conditions for the dormice to flourish while also making this woodland a really great place for people to visit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dormice facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The hazel dormouse is a European protected species&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The hazel or common dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) is the only dormouse species that is native to the UK&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The UK is required to monitor them and to take steps to achieve and maintain a &amp;lsquo;favourable conservation status&amp;rsquo;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The National Dormouse Monitoring Programme was set up to monitor the population and find out what&amp;rsquo;s happening to numbers&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Since recording began in the UK in the early 1990s a long-term decline in both the number of dormice, and the range of the species, has been observed. The decline is believed to have been going on for at least 100 years, although recent results indicate that the decline could now be slowing&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;In 2005 the UK hazel dormouse population was estimated to be around 45,000 animals&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;An ongoing dormouse reintroduction programme is helping to slowly extend the current range&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo has helped to monitor a site in Bontuchel in North Wales for 10 years. The survey has shown that the dormouse population is stable &amp;ndash; the dormice at the site are not following the national downward population trend. This makes it an extremely important site for study - to try to understand why this woodland is so good for dormice&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Over 900 hazel dormice have been microchipped at Bontuchel over 10 years&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;230 artificial nest boxes have been created to help the population thrive&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The project has so far provided data for one PhD, three MSc and numerous BSC projects, another PhD is in progress. The project has contributed to papers at three international dormouse conferences over the last nine years and produced several peer review journal papers&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The hazel part of their name comes from the hazel nuts they feed on, and the dormouse from the French word &amp;lsquo;dormir,&amp;rsquo; which means &amp;lsquo;to sleep&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; very apt as they sleep for two thirds of their lives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{184752FA-C3C8-4CC4-97A5-06C67CD72629}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rare-monkey-born</link><title>Rare monkey born at Chester Zoo</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A rare capuchin monkey born at Chester Zoo has given a boost to a species seriously threatened with extinction in the wild. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Buffy-headed capuchins - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/monkeys-and-apes/monkeys/Capuchins-2.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;HOLD ON! A 12-week-old buffy-headed capuchin monkey hitches a ride with mum at Chester Zoo. The buffy-headed capuchin is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s rarest species of primates.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The buffy-headed capuchin, which is listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being critically endangered in the wild, arrived after a 180 day pregnancy for its 15-year-old mum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; The arrival brings the number of buffy-headed capuchins at the zoo to eight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Assistant curator of mammals, Dr Nick Davis, said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The buffy-headed capuchin is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s rarest species of primates. In the past they were abundant in the Atlantic rainforests of eastern Brazil but sadly they&amp;rsquo;re now on the verge of disappearing from the wild because of severe destruction to their habitat and intense hunting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to say though that our new youngster is doing extremely well and is now confidently out and about, being carried by mum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; Keepers at the zoo won&amp;rsquo;t know the sex of their new charge for several weeks.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Buffy-headed capuchin facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The buffy-headed capuchin is a fairly small monkey with reddish-brown fur and a sharply marked yellow to golden chest &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; They are also known as yellow-breasted or golden-bellied capuchins &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Its Latin name is Cebus xanthosternos &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Buffy-headed capuchins are endemic to small areas of rainforest on the Atlantic coast of Brazil &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The species is classed as critically endangered in the wild by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This is a result of a severe population decline due to extensive habitat loss over the last 50 years. It is estimated that more than 80% of their natural range has been lost and the species is now only know to live in several small protected areas. They are also heavily hunted for meat and collected as pets &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; They have been named as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s 25 most endangered primates by the IUCN &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Their diet consists of a wide variety of fruits, seeds, stems, flowers and leaves as well as insects, spiders frogs, young birds and even small mammals &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; It is a social monkey that lives in groups, usually with more males than females&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Males are slightly larger and heavier than females &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The group communicates through barks, growls, screams, chatters, trills, twitters, purrs, whistles and warbles &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s new youngster was born on 13/08/2014.

The taste is described as hot and fiery and men believe that eating the meat of this powerful, horned animal will give them prowess.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hunters are even managing to breach areas of Sulawesi which were thought to give protection to the anoas.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The only way this hunting pressure can be reduced is through the establishment of better protected areas and education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The species, which is a miniature water buffalo, is sometimes referred to as the &amp;lsquo;demon&amp;rsquo; of the forest as local farmers wrongly believe them to come out of the forest at night and use their horns to puncture cattle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Anoa - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/anoa/Anoa-19.ashx\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Davis added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the wild they&amp;rsquo;ve been given the unfair tag as being &amp;lsquo;demons&amp;rsquo; of the forest. As a result they&amp;rsquo;re persecuted by farmers who hold them responsible for damage to their cattle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take one look at our new calf and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to see how anyone could label or harm them in such a way &amp;ndash; they&amp;rsquo;re a very shy and secretive animal.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next spring the zoo&amp;rsquo;s anoa family will move to a brand new exhibit when Islands, a new &amp;pound;30m development, opens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islands, which will recreate habitats in the Phillipines, Bali, Sulawesi, Papua, Sumba and Sumatra, is billed as the biggest and most ambitious expansion project in UK zoo history. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Davis added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Indonesian islands are treasure trove of unique and fragile plants and animals and that&amp;rsquo;s why they&amp;rsquo;re a big focus for our conservation work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it opens next year we hope our new Islands zone will really put the spotlight on species such Sumatran orangutans, Sumatran tigers, Visayan warty pigs, Bali starlings and anoa and the threats they face.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Anoa facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The anoa, named after the Sulawesi word for buffalo, is a wild cattle species native to forests in Indonesia. This miniature water buffalo, which barely reach a metre in height, is divided into lowland and mountain species although there is still some debate as to whether they are in fact different&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are the smallest species of wild cattle &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They live in forests and swamps on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Lowland anoa, as the name suggests, can be found in low-lying regions of swampy forest&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are listed as an endangered species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), meaning they face a very high risk of extinction in the wild &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;It is estimated that less than 2,500 mature individuals remain &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Numbers have been declining throughout Sulawesi as a result of hunting for their meat and habitat loss, with forest being converted to agriculture, namely rice paddies &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Very little is known about the ecology and life history of the anoas&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The species is solitary, secret and silent and live alone or in pairs, rather than herds. Being able to stay silent as a solitary animal is safer in the forest than being part of a herd where disturbance is more likely and cover blown&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are browsers, feeding on vegetation &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are reported to drink seawater, which may be a source of minerals&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Their distinctive flattened horns are a formidable weapon&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s new female calf was born on 22/10/2014.

It will create the feeling of an expedition and make visitors feel like they&amp;rsquo;re following in the footsteps of the great explorers&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;42,000 plants be used to recreate the environments of the six different islands&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The flagship indoor building that will be part of Islands will be called the Monsoon Forest &amp;ndash; the largest indoor zoo exhibit in the UK. It will be totally unique in this country and will feature free flight birds, Sumatran orangutans, macaques and crocodiles&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Other animals include anoa, banteng, babirusa, Bali starling, cassowary, Indonesian rhinoceros hornbill, Indonesian wrinkled hornbill, lorikeet, Sumatran tiger and the Visayan warty pig&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The zoo hopes that by showcasing animals like this, then visitors seeing animals in an even more naturalistic setting than ever before, will make more of an emotional connection with them.

A new spectacled bear, named Lima, has arrived as part of the zoo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds plans to breed the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Spectacled bear\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/bears/Lima (6).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Two-year-old spectacled bear Lima takes a stroll around her new enclosure at Chester Zoo. Lima has arrived from a zoo in northern France as part of the Europe breeding programme for the species, which is vulnerable to extinction in the wild.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two-year-old Lima has moved from a zoo in northern France after experts carefully matched her with Chester&amp;rsquo;s male bear, Bernardo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Spectacled bears are vulnerable to extinction in the wild and so staff at the zoo hope the pair will eventually go on to produce cubs, adding new blood to the insurance population living in zoos around the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bears, which are found in Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, are threatened by habitat loss; persecuted by local farmers for killing cattle and destroying crops and hunted for their meat, skin, bones, fat and claws. It is believed that only 20,000 now remain in the wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2013 the zoo funded a project in Peru investigating the foraging behaviour of spectacled bears. The project ultimately aims to ensure the conservation of the species in the dry forest habitat of northern Peru through scientific research and education, while working collaboratively with private land owners and rural communities to improve their social and economic wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The arrival of Lima brings the number of spectacled bears living at the zoo to three.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Spectacled bear at Chester ZOo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/bears/Lima (11).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Spectacled bear facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Spectacled bears get their name from the white or light rings of fur around their eyes, which can look like glasses (spectacles)&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Spectacled bears are found in several areas of northern and western South America, including western Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and western Bolivia&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are sometimes referred to as Andean bears, after the Andes mountains where some individuals are found&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are found in various habitats within the Andes Mountains, including desert-scrub, &amp;lsquo;Paramo&amp;rsquo; or high altitude grasslands and lush, misty cloud forests, ranging in elevation from 250 to 4,750 m&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Males can grow up to 40% larger than females. Their head-body length ranges from 1.2 &amp;ndash; 2 metres&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Females weigh up to 84kg, males up to about 150kg&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Spectacled bears are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;There are only about 20,000 left in the wild&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The main threats to the species are&amp;nbsp;habitat fragmentation and destruction caused by livestock farming and logging is a major threat to this species. Spectacled bears are also persecuted by local farmers for killing cattle and destroying maize crops. Habitat fragmentation continues to bring bears and humans into closer proximity, leading to increased human-bear conflict&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Though the hunting of spectacled bears is illegal, the species is still poached for its meat, skin, bones, fat and claws, which are all in demand locally. The gall bladders are occasionally marketed, being of value in traditional oriental medicine and can fetch a high price on the international market&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Very little is known about these bears in the wild, as they are shy and tend to avoid humans, making them hard to find for researchers to study&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Because of their tropical native climate, Andean bears do not hibernate and are active year-round&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s new female spectacled Lima was born on Jan 12, 2012&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Lima has moved to Chester from Cerza Zoo in Lisieux, France as part of a breeding programme for the species&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo is already home to male spectacled bear Bernardo and female Franka &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Anyone who's read the children's stories about Paddington Bear will know he came from deepest darkest Peru.

We already welcome 1.4 million visitors a year and Islands will bring many, many more. But a holistic approach to what the North can and does offer would be a very positive step forward for tourism growth and we look forward to seeing this strategy progress and to playing our part in it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Islands is one of the most ambitious projects in the history of UK zoos. Visitors will move through detailed recreations of habitats in the Philippines, Bali, Sulawesi, Papua, Sumba and Sumatra on their own personal conservation expedition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=\"feature\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"feature-inner\"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER CALLS FOR STRATEGY TO BOOST TOURISM IN THE NORTH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;pound;10m of government money to back proposals for a clear strategy for tourism in the North, bringing harmony to the current offer from 29 individual tourism boards into one great offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;London has 4.5 times more international visitors than the North of England as a whole. Scotland has twice as many tourists as Yorkshire or the entire North West.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;London is not this country&amp;rsquo;s only tourist destination &amp;ndash; the North boasts stunning countryside, history and culture.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;But how would anyone know that when there is no strategy for selling the North as a tourist destination. 30 per cent of UK visitors chose not to travel beyond London because they simply didn&amp;rsquo;t know what there was to see outside the capital.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;I launched a major project called Northern Futures &amp;ndash; asking people in the North what our Northern cities needed in order to compete globally, and to grow.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from businesses, local people, academics and council leaders. Your resounding call is clear - a strong Northern future relies on putting the North back on the map. Including making the region a top tourist destination with great transport, and thriving industry such as technology.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;On the eve of the Northern Futures Summit I&amp;rsquo;m responding to your calls for a coherent strategy for attracting tourists.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;And that is why I&amp;rsquo;m making available &amp;pound;10m of government money to back proposals for a clear strategy for tourism in the North, bringing harmony to the current offer from 29 individual tourism boards into one great offer.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Creating a vision and plan will bring more visitors on holiday from at home and abroad to our great Northern cities. As the most senior member of the cabinet representing the North, I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about the region. However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t for Whitehall to deliver. It&amp;rsquo;s important that this strategy is led by those already championing tourism in the North.&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Leeds hosting the Northern Futures Summit this Thursday to bring creative minds from across the North together so that we can grow more ideas like this into a reality.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s absurd that our great North is missing out on visitors when it boasts such stunning countryside, history and culture. Through the Northern Futures project, I asked people what our Northern cities needed in order to compete globally, and to grow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;\"Your resounding call is clear - a strong Northern future relies on putting the North back on the map: a top tourist destination. From next year, I&amp;rsquo;m putting funding in place for there to be a clear strategy for tourism in the North, bringing harmony to the current offer from 29 individual tourism boards into one great offer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minister for Tourism Helen Grant said:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;I grew up in Carlisle and know first-hand how important tourism is to the North of England. So I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about championing the vibrant culture, fascinating heritage and stunning landscapes the north offers to tourists. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This &amp;pound;10 million fund will build on the success of the Government&amp;rsquo;s tourism strategy to date, which has bought record numbers of visitors and spend to the UK. But we want to see a greater spread of tourism across the country and this will ensure that the North benefits from this element of our long term economic plan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We know there are a whole host of attractions across the North which are perfect hot spots for tourism. An industry which strengthens the economy and shows off the appeal of the North. And yet, every year, we see 4.5 times more visitors flocking to our capital city, than to the North. More people visited the British Museum than all tourist attractions in the North East put together last year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are 9 guidebooks by one famous brand for different parts of Italy. There are just two by the same famous brand for Britain - London and Scotland. It&amp;rsquo;s high time we create a harmonious offer to tourists for the North of England as a whole; putting our much loved Northern landmarks on the map and at the top of people&amp;rsquo;s holiday wish lists.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We want to see tourists planning visits to Penny Lane and the Beatles Museum in Liverpool, rather than automatically heading to the Abbey Road crossing. Taking in the impressive York Minster and the beauty of the Lake District, rather than thinking that Buckingham Palace defines British pomp.  Touring the ground of Alnwick Castle which was used as the exterior of Harry Potter&amp;rsquo;s Hogwarts, instead of Windsor Castle seeming like the only option.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So the question is &lt;strong&gt;how do we get people flying across the world to our great Northern cities?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Currently, there are 29 bodies pulling people to their individual localities in the North. In an age of one-stop-shop websites where people can compare holidays in Beirut to Bangalore, the North is sinking down the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t get more people landing in the North on holiday with separate organisations competing against each other for visitors. However, if they work together with a joint vision and a strategy focusing on the best of the region, then we will have a whole much greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through the Northern Futures project, I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to your ideas and thoughts on how we communicate the greatness of the North to build a stronger economy. It&amp;rsquo;s clear we need tourism in the North to be a joint effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So today I&amp;rsquo;m calling for a strategy which will bring together the local knowledge of the 29 organisations, market the existing strengths of our Northern cities and pull together a plan for bringing more people to the North.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tourism efforts aren&amp;rsquo;t joined up: &lt;/strong&gt;If you were sitting in the US and wanted to book a holiday that explored Ancient Britain, taking in Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Wall, York&amp;rsquo;s Viking history and the roman city of Chester, you&amp;rsquo;d need to log on to 3 different visit websites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People aren&amp;rsquo;t visiting the North: &lt;/strong&gt;The whole of the North only accounted for 22% of all visits to English tourist attractions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would we do it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subject to strong proposals, I will make available &amp;pound;10 million from the Regional Growth Fund&amp;not; for the development of a new strategy for tourism in the North. Ring-fenced funding will be channelled into the national tourist body for our country, Visit England, with support from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. This will need to be matched by local funds to ensure potential tourists are provided with a compelling joined up picture of what&amp;rsquo;s on offer in the North.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the North have to offer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is a cornucopia of attractions in the region, from the Lake District to the Peak District; from Penny Lane to Wilberforce House; Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s Wall, Blackpool Tower, Bettys tea rooms Harrogate, the National Football Museum, York Minster, Durham cathedral, the MAGNA Science Centre, Castle Howard and the Angel of the North. The list of international attractions is almost endless. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{25021BD1-4895-4A96-8AC1-42430FA11C94}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/dwarf-mongoose-pups-emerge</link><title>Dwarf mongoose pups emerge at Chester Zoo</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Two dwarf mongoose pups born at Chester Zoo have taken tiny steps into the outside world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The little youngsters, the smallest of all the African carnivores, were spotted by keepers enjoying their first adventure at the zoo.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=\"video\"&gt;   &lt;iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/HJ1-2leC_Vc?rel=0\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__top\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__right\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__bottom\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__left\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The duo spent a month in their nest box with keepers just hearing occasional squeaks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twilight team manager Dave White said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now that our new duo has started exploring they&amp;rsquo;re going to keep mum, dad and the rest of the dwarf  mongoose group very much on their tiny toes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dwarf mongoose are highly sociable animals, living in groups where each mongoose has a job to do. When a litter of young is born then the whole group helps to care for them, with females other than their mum even producing milk for them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They may be small but they&amp;rsquo;re a fascinating species and what they lack in size they certainly make up for in likability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The arrival of the pups brings the number of &lt;a href=\"/animals/mammals/meerkats_otters_mongooses/dwarf-mongoose\"&gt;dwarf mongoose&lt;/a&gt; at the zoo to nine but it&amp;rsquo;s too early for keepers to be able to tell if the pups are male or female.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Dwarf mongoose at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/meerkat_otter_mongoose/dwarf-mongoose/Mongoose-1 (2).ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Dwarf mongoose - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/meerkat_otter_mongoose/dwarf-mongoose/Mongoose-9.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Dwarf mongoose facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Dwarf mongoose are found in many parts of Africa, living in woodlands, grasslands and rocky outcrops&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They mainly feed on locusts, beetles, spiders, termites, grubs and mealworms, smaller mammals like mice, small birds, lizards and snakes&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;They are Africa&amp;rsquo;s smallest carnivore, as well as the smallest of the mongoose species&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Adult dwarf mongoose only grow to about 30cm (12 inches)&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Mongoose live in groups led by an alpha female and her male partner&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Dwarf mongoose are related to meerkats&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The group has a social structure with each mongoose having a job to do.

It is hoped that Kifaru will sire a number of new calves and bring vital new blood to the European population of Eastern black rhinos &amp;ndash; a species classed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically endangered in the wild.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine-year-old Kifaru - an Eastern black rhino - is settling in to his new home after travelling from Hannover Zoo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Staff in Chester hope their new arrival will sire a number of new calves and bring vital new blood to the European population of Eastern black rhinos &amp;ndash; a species classed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically endangered in the wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He will soon be introduced to the zoo&amp;rsquo;s current females, starting with Ema Elsa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo&amp;rsquo;s curator of mammals, Tim Rowlands, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a species that&amp;rsquo;s as highly threatened with extinction as the Eastern black rhino, all individuals in the European breeding programme are important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As so few individuals exist, it is essential that we achieve successful breeding from as many of the rhinos in zoos as possible. Kifaru has only sired three calves previously; this means he has a great opportunity to add to the dwindling numbers of black rhino which makes him one of the most important rhinos around. Any offspring he may go on to produce here would bring vital genetics to the European population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This population is vital as an insurance policy against further declines in the wild and the more successful the population is, the better that insurance policy can be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We have one of the best records in the world when it comes to breeding rhinos, so fingers crossed we can encourage Kifaru to work his magic with our females.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Black rhino - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/horses-and-rhinos/black-rhino/Rhino-2.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are now thought to be less than 650 Eastern black rhinos remaining in the wild, placing the species perilously close to extinction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Numbers in Africa have plummeted as a result of a dramatic surge in illegal poaching. A global increase in demand for rhino horn to supply the traditional Asian medicine market, where it is wrongly believed to be a cure for everything from nightmares to dysentery, has intensified the situation in recent times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emerging markets in Vietnam and an upsurge in the supply of arms used to hunt rhino, have further added to the problem. This attrition is being driven by the astonishing street value for rhino horn, which fetches &amp;pound;40,000 a kilo - more than gold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo has long supported conservation efforts in the wild to try and protect black rhinos and continues to pump money, and provide expertise, to numerous projects in Africa.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Black rhino - breeding programme at Chester Zoo \" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/horses-and-rhinos/black-rhino/Rhino-7.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Notes to editors&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Eastern black rhino are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The current number of Eastern black rhino in the wild is less than 650. This is 90% lower than three generations ago &amp;ndash; largely a result of a dramatic surge in illegal poaching&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;There are 313 black rhino (made up on two subspecies, &lt;em&gt;D. b. michaeli&lt;/em&gt; (264) and &lt;em&gt;D. b. minor &lt;/em&gt;(49)) in captivity worldwide according to the international studbook 2013&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Dr. Mark Pilgrim, Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s director general, co-ordinates the European breeding programme for one of the subspecies of black rhino (&lt;em&gt;D. b. michaeli&lt;/em&gt;)  of which there are 62 held in zoos in Europe (10% of the total wild population of this sub-species, Eastern black rhino). This population is an insurance population for their wild relatives&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Helping to ensure an insurance population exists in the event that black rhino become extinct in the wild, Chester Zoo has been successful in breeding a number of critically endangered black rhinos and plays a vital part in the international breeding programme&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;In 2007, Chester Zoo established its Wildlife Endocrinology Laboratory. Endocrinology is an important tool in Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s mission to conserve biodiversity. When animals fail to thrive or breed, clues can generally be found through hormone assessment. Hormones associated with reproduction and adrenal function are easily measured non-invasively in urine and faeces. Its role is to enhance the well-being and reproductive success of threatened species, both in zoos and in the wild. This ground-breaking science has helped to achieve a rhino baby boom at the zoo in recent years, with four black rhino calves born in the space of just four years&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Chester Zoo has long supported conservation efforts in the wild to try and protect black rhinos and continues to pump money, and provide expertise, to numerous projects in Africa&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;People can help to protect wild rhinos by donating to &lt;a href=\"http://www.actforwildlife.org.uk/black-rhinos/black-rhinos\"&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s Act for Wildlife rhino project&lt;/a&gt;, where 100% of the money donated is used at conservation projects in the wild.&lt;/li&gt;      &lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{C480F19A-BE50-4477-8770-96D3792AB694}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/sand-lizards-reintroduced</link><title>UK\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds rarest lizards return to sand dunes</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Keepers and conservationists at Chester Zoo join breeding and reintroduction efforts to help boost sand lizard numbers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=\"video\"&gt;   &lt;iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/X9nFWekX5xY?rel=0\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__top\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__right\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__bottom\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__left\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rare lizards, which were believed to have gone extinct in Wales around 60 years ago, have been released on sand dunes in the north of the country in a bid to boost struggling populations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sand lizards - an endangered UK species - were bred at a number of specialist breeding centres, including Chester Zoo, during the summer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The species has gone through major decline due to habitat loss, with their coastal dune and heathland habitats becoming increasingly fragmented by agricultural expansion and building developments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a captive breeding and reintroduction programme is now helping the lizards to make a comeback at a site in Talacre, North Wales.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Keeper Ruth Smith - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Keeper Ruth Smith helps return 31 sand lizards to North Wales.ashx\" style=\"font-size: 12px; line-height: 15.600000381469727px;\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Herpetology keeper Ruth Smith said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sand lizards are the UK&amp;rsquo;s rarest lizard and populations in some areas are so low that we can&amp;rsquo;t just rely on protecting the site, we have to help breed them to boost their numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Surveys have shown that sand lizard numbers have significantly improved in the locations where they have been released before and it&amp;rsquo;s proven that those bred in the likes of zoos have a higher chance of survival than those that hatch in the wild.

She says: &amp;ldquo;Although some black rhinoceros breed well in zoos, not all do therefore reducing the vital genetic reserve that these populations represent. This species is of high conservation importance, so understanding what could be limiting breeding in certain individuals and how we could make improvements is a priority.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;In total 9743 samples from 11 zoos were sent to Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s Wildlife Endocrinology laboratory to analyse female reproductive cycles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Dr Edwards says: &amp;ldquo;Our analyses showed that females who had never bred were more likely to exhibit irregular oestrous cycles, indicating that underlying physiology is involved in differences in breeding success.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Dr Edwards continues:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;ldquo;As well as non-breeding females not cycling as reliably, behavioural observations showed us that these females don't necessarily show when they are ready to mate, which can make managing breeding difficult. Hormone analysis helps address this problem by allowing us to predict when a female will be sexually receptive to a male, even if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it obvious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Hormone analysis has been successfully used at Chester Zoo which has seen three births in the last three years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;As well as looking at hormone analysis, the researchers also investigated a number of other factors that could affect breeding success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Females that had never bred were found to be heavier than those that had, demonstrating that maintaining a suitable diet in zoos can play an important role in the success of breeding programmes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Non-breeding females were also found to be more unpredictable in their overall temperaments.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Dr Susanne Shultz from the Faculty of Life Sciences at The University of Manchester was the academic supervisor for the project. She says: &amp;ldquo;This research highlights how rhinos can behave in a different manner despite being kept in similar conditions. We think this demonstrates that it is important to recognise individual differences and adjust management plans accordingly to maximise the health and reproduction across all individuals in the population.\"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Dr Sue Walker, Head of Applied Science at Chester Zoo, oversaw the project.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;She concludes:   &lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;ldquo;Poaching in the wild is a serious threat to the rhino; therefore it is important for us to understand the factors that can influence reproductive success. We established the project to understand why some individuals breed well, while others do not. The idea is that with a better understanding of factors that affect reproduction, we know where we should be focusing our efforts to support the European-wide breeding programme for this critically endangered species.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;The results of the study have been published in the Journal of General and Comparative Endocrinology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:02 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{665ACA4A-F235-4F78-81E1-CE8A3457D5F7}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/tickled-pink-flamingo-chicks</link><title>Chester Zoo has welcomed some new additions to its flamingo flock.</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Chilean flamingo chicks started to hatch on July 18 with 13 more arriving since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"\" src=\"/~/media/pr-folder/Flamingo-1.ashx?h=640&amp;amp;w=445\" style=\"line-height: 1.3;\" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Flamingo chicks debut at Chester Zoo&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;div style=\"font-weight: bold;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Curator of birds, Andrew Owen, said:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &amp;ldquo;Their trademark pink feathers won&amp;rsquo;t start to show for about six months - instead the chicks have a mix of grey and white feathers.

They also live in Argentina, Bolivia and Ecuador where they reside mainly on estuaries, lagoons, mud flats and salt lakes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The species is classed as a near threatened species &amp;ndash; meaning they are likely to become endangered and threatened with a high risk of extinction in the wild in the near future. Habitat loss and poaching of their eggs are blamed for a decrease in their numbers. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s flock of Chilean flamingos, which has been at the zoo since the 1960s, now numbers 112.&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Flamingo facts&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;There are about 200,000-300,000 Chilean flamingos in the wild where continued monitoring of their numbers is vital as they have long been a target of poachers who pinch their eggs.

But soon enough they&amp;rsquo;ll develop golden feathers on top of their heads that almost resemble a Roman helmet. Already the young are very confident and capable of foraging with their parents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cranes are also known for their elaborate dances and our young chicks are already capable of some nifty moves!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;West African black-crowed cranes are listed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with just 15,000 estimated to remain in the wild. The birds&amp;rsquo; range spans from Senegal to Chad but its habitat is under threat due to drainage, overgrazing and pesticide pollution. The capture and trade of the species is also having a dramatic effect on wild numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Owen added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as suffering from habitat loss and poisoning by farmers, black-crowned cranes are also caught and used as &amp;lsquo;guard dogs&amp;rsquo;. They are also disappearing as they hit newly installed overhead power lines. This all means that sadly, these birds are now very rare in the wild.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo has supported initiatives to assist in the conservation of black crowned cranes in coastal areas of West Africa&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Black-crowned crane born at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/birds/cranes/black-crowned-crane/Cranes-43.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;West African black-crowned crane facts&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;The chicks hatched at Chester Zoo on 19/07/14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Dad was born on 15/08/2002 and is nearly 12 years old.

Three-day-old tapir Zathras makes his public debut at Chester Zoo&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The tiny calf was born on Monday at 11am to mum Jenny after a gestation period of around 13 months. The new youngster &amp;ndash; the first male to be born at the zoo for eight years - has already been given the name Zathras.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curator of mammals, Tim Rowlands, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our new calf, Zathras, was up and about really quickly and he and mum are doing fine. Jenny is an experienced mum and she&amp;rsquo;s doing a top job.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the moment Zathras looks a bit like a little humbug. His brown coat currently features lots of white stripes and spots which will eventually disappear as he gets to around six-to-nine months old. The markings act as camouflage in the wild &amp;ndash; mimicking speckled sunlight on the forest floor. He won&amp;rsquo;t be little for long though as new youngsters tend to double their weight in the first 14-21 days alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo, which was named as the best zoo in the UK in a recent Trip Advisor poll, has enjoyed good breeding successes with tapirs in the past - including Zathras&amp;rsquo;s 22-year-old dad Cuzco who was also born at the zoo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the wild Brazilian, or lowland, tapirs live in wet forests and grasslands in South America where they are threatened because of habitat destruction and hunting. They are classed as vulnerable to extinction by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo is a keen supporter of a conservation initiative which has been finding out valuable information about behaviour patterns and movements of tapirs in several key areas of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is hoped this research will help safeguard the future of the fascinating species which is increasingly hunted for its meat and for its hide, which is used to make sandals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Baby tapir at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/tapir/baby-tapir/Tapir-35.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tapir facts&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;New baby Zathras was born at 11am on 04/08/2014&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Mum is called Jenny who was born on 24/07/1992.

They have similar toes, teeth and skull structures and rock hyraxes also have two large continually growing incisors, which correspond to an elephant&amp;rsquo;s tusks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And whereas small mammals normally have a short pregnancy period, for the rock hyrax it lasts for around seven and a half months (245 days) - another sign of their relation to their much larger ancestors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rock hyraxes are native to Africa but can also be found along the coast of the Arabian Peninsula and in Israel where they are protected by law. As their name suggests, they live in rocky terrain, seeking shelter and protection in rugged outcrops or cliffs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new arrivals can be seen with their parents in their exhibit at the zoo, which is part of its African painted dogs&amp;rsquo; trail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Rock hyrax at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/elephants/rock-hyrax/RockHyrax-7.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Rock hyrax facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s rock hyrax mum is five-years-old, born on 8/7/2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Dad, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Nungu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;, is four years and 11 months old, born on 18/8/2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Hyraxes don&amp;rsquo;t need much water because they get most of it from their food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Hyrax feet are built for rock climbing - the bottom of each foot is bare and has a moist, rubbery pad that provides a suction-cup effect to help the hyrax cling to rocks without slipping&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Rock hyraxes have excellent eye sight&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;When the pups are born they look like miniature adults &amp;ndash; born with their eyes and ears open and with the same coat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:03 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{7512859A-631F-4366-AB18-E38CCE61F3DF}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rare-parrot-given-endangered-status</link><title>Rare parrot given \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdendangered\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd status in new report following zoo team\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds study</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A rare parrot has been given a new \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdendangered\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd status after a group of researchers from Chester Zoo headed to South America to track down and learn more about the species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Chester\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Ecuador-22.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Chester Zoo sent an expedition to South America to search for a rare parrot known as the Ecuador Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo&amp;rsquo;s team of 10, which included experienced conservationists, biologists, avian and horticultural experts, spent two weeks following the Ecuador Amazon parrot &amp;ndash; a bird that was only recognised as a species in its own right in December 2013 after years of study by the zoo&amp;rsquo;s director general, Dr Mark Pilgrim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Previously, the Ecuador Amazon parrot was considered to be a subspecies of a common group of birds, with a population of about five million. As a result of the size of the population, it did not rank among conservationists&amp;rsquo; priorities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Dr Mark Pilgrim\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Dr Mark Pilgrim spent years studying the parrots.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Dr Mark Pilgrim spent years studying the parrots&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;However with full species status awarded the parrot has now taken on a whole new level of importance. Only 600 individuals are estimated to be left, prompting the species to be officially listed as endangered and put at a very high risk of extinction in the wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The listing was made for the first time by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature&amp;rsquo;s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, which evaluates the conservation status of plant and animals species.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Ecuador amazon parrot\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/Ecuador amazon parrot.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Ecuador amazon parrot&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Pilgrim said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The estimated total population for this species is about 600. But the sub-populations are less than 250 birds. So, based on our findings, the IUCN is now classifying the birds as an endangered species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This new listing is something of a double-edged sword. While on the one hand it confirms that the species&amp;rsquo; continued existence is under real threat, the good news is that it will now be considered a conservation priority and will attract resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The expedition team was based in the Cerro Blanco forest in South West Ecuador where they gathered new information on the parrots&amp;rsquo; behaviour and feeding habits and conducted a survey on the two unique types of habitat that they rely on &amp;ndash; mangroves and dry forest.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very little was known about the Ecuador Amazon parrot in the wild, added Dr Pilgrim. That&amp;rsquo;s precisely why the team and I spent a number of weeks trekking in the oppressive humidity of the forest - one of the few remaining remnants of tropical dry forest in the world &amp;ndash; to gather new data about the species.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If truth be told though we actually came back with far more questions than answers. Suddenly, there are a number of things that we didn't expect and we now have questions about &amp;ndash; but that&amp;rsquo;s science.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;One example was how the parrots chose their roosting sites within the mangroves of Puerto Hondo, located along the western coast of Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We knew from past literature and from a previous visit we had made that the parrots roost in the mangroves and fly to the dry forests to feed. The assumption was that they did that to protect themselves from predators that were not found on the mangrove islands.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the birds fly very, very far out into the mangroves &amp;ndash; why do they need to do that? Nearby shrimp farms use bird scaring devices, which are designed to frighten herons and shore birds and stop them eating the farms' stock. So is this affecting the parrots' behaviour? We just don't know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Something Dr Pilgrim could say for certain though was that there are some very positive signs as far as the remaining habitat is concerned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;From our survey of 30km of forest trails and from images we managed to obtain via our camera traps, we saw there is a wide amount of biodiversity within the Cerro Blanco Forest, illustrating a healthy ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We saw no evidence of illegal activity and areas that just 20 years ago used to be farm land are now on their way to be restored to their former glory. This is excellent news &amp;ndash; a credit to the work that the Pro Bosque Foundation [a local conservation organisation working to protect the forest] puts in and a real basis for hope in terms of preserving not only the parrots but all of the other wonderful wildlife that calls the forest its home as well. In that sense, it is very reassuring that the area appears to be well protected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo now hopes to repeat the Cerro Blanco survey every three years in order to build up a long-term dataset that would allow researchers to monitor the parrots' population dynamics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr Pilgrim added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;While there is concern, there is still a lot to do before we can make clear and bold statements about exactly what is happening to this fantastic species. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:03 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{AF5CD6E2-063F-4CFE-895A-CF9B478B5E99}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/giant-python-given-ultrasound</link><title>Giant python JF given ultrasound heart scan at Chester Zoo</title><description>&lt;p&gt;While we all tend to dread visits to the doctor \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd not many of us require ten people to get us there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Python health check\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/python/Python-17.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s JF the python is no ordinary patient, and as she measures around 23ft in length, the great snake required a team of zookeepers and vets to carry her in for her annual health check.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reticulated python &amp;ndash; the longest species of snake in the world &amp;ndash; had her eyes covered to keep her calm as she was looked over. Indeed JF is thought to be one of the biggest snakes in Europe, weighing in at around 60kgs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As well as checks on her general health, JF met cardio experts &amp;ndash; Eric Stohr and Aimee Drane from Cardiff Metropolitan University &amp;ndash; who took the opportunity to perform an ultrasound scan on the giant snake&amp;rsquo;s heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class=\"video\"&gt;   &lt;iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/Cljbbz4bgLI?rel=0\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__top\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__right\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__bottom\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__left\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Python ultrasound - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/python/Python-19.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Python ultrasound at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/python/Python-20.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo's pythons are taking part in cardiological study as part of a joint research programme between the zoo and the university. It is hoped that looking at JF will also provide insight for people studying the human heart.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team of cardio experts have attempted similar tests on giraffes and sharks but say snake hearts are of particular interest because they have three chambers, unlike human hearts which have four.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Steve Unwin, from Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s vet team, said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re pleased that we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to get some nice, clear ultrasound images of JF&amp;rsquo;s heart and it&amp;rsquo;s helped us to see that she&amp;rsquo;s healthy on the inside, as well as on the outside. That&amp;rsquo;s the primary reason we wanted to have a good look at JF today &amp;ndash; to ensure she&amp;rsquo;s in tip top condition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, adding to this, we&amp;rsquo;re also interested in anything that can help with the understanding of human heart health. It is already proven that a snake&amp;rsquo;s heart can expand and reduce in size in relation to eating a big meal and digesting it. But the only time the heart thickens or thins in humans is when there are real cardio problems. So if we can build up our knowledge of how snake hearts function, we could potentially learn a lot from this comparative data.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reticulated pythons are native to south east Asia, a region in which Chester Zoo is involved in several conservation projects looking to protect animal and plant species in the wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The species&amp;rsquo; large size and distinctive scale patterns have resulted in them being heavily exploited for skin to make popular leather products such as belts, wallets and boots. Habitat loss is another significant threat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Reticulated python health check\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/python/Python-38.ashx\" /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curator of mammals Tim Rowlands said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pudu numbers have declined partly due to their habitat being destroyed and cleared for cattle ranching and other human developments, as well as persecution from domestic and hunting dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Is it a dinosaur? Is it a plucked chicken? No, it&amp;rsquo;s a parrot! Keepers at Chester Zoo are providing around-the-clock care to a rare hyacinth macaw chick named Jessie. The baby bird, who is now a month old, is being fed up to nine times a day in a Tupperware tub which is acting as a crib. The species is endangered in the wild as wild populations have undergone rapid reductions in recent years due to the illegal pet trade and habitat loss. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The month-old hyacinth macaw chick is being hand-reared by zookeepers after it was hatched in an incubator.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The chick, which is described as looking like a &amp;ldquo;cross between a dinosaur and a plucked chicken&amp;rdquo;, is so small that it is being kept in a Tupperware tub that is doubling up as a crib.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keepers, who are providing the baby bird with around-the-clock care, have given the youngster the unisex name Jessie &amp;ndash; as it will be some time until it develops feathers that they can send away for DNA analysis in order to sex the youngster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Hyacinth macaw - Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/news/2014/macaw/Macaw-21.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeper Karen Neech said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that our chick will eventually start to spring some beautiful deep blue feathers &amp;ndash; at the moment it looks more like a dinosaur crossed with a plucked chicken!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;But with all of the care and attention we&amp;rsquo;re giving, it&amp;rsquo;s growing bigger and stronger by the day. At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m feeding it a special mixture of powdered vitamins every two hours between 6am until 11pm. This will go on for around three months until the bird is weaned and can feed by itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;At this stage our new charge is doing really well &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;re really pleased.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hyacinth macaws are the world&amp;rsquo;s largest parrot and are found in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. They are considered an endangered species as wild populations have undergone rapid reductions in recent years due to the illegal pet trade and habitat loss as a result of land clearance for cattle ranching.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The striking birds also have a naturally slow reproductive rate, which means that once a population is reduced through over trapping and habitat loss, it takes a long time to recover.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Karen added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The hatching of this chick is a major step forward in our efforts to ensure a healthy insurance population of these stunning birds exists in zoos.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;On top of that, the skills that the bird keeping team develop whilst hand-rearing the chick at the zoo can be applied to our conservation programmes in the wild - something we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to do successfully with species such as the endangered echo parakeet in Mauritius.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jesse&amp;rsquo;s parents, who can be seen in the zoo&amp;rsquo;s Tropical Realm, are affectionately known as James Bond and Miss Moneypenny. Dad gets his name from his ring number &amp;ndash; 007. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hyacinth macaw facts&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Hyacinth macaws are the biggest birds in the parrot family, reaching up to 100cm tall&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; In the wild they live in north and central Brazil, north west Paraguay and eastern Bolivia&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Adults have deep blue feathers, a yellow ring around their eye and yellow near their black, curved beaks&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Most of their feeding is done on the ground where they use their bumper sized beaks to crack large palm nuts that are much too tough for any other animal to break open. They have a bone inside their tongue which makes it an excellent tool for breaking open and eating food&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; In the wild they live in South America, mainly Brazil, but numbers have fallen drastically&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; Over recent decades they were relentlessly hunted for the pet trade and also suffered as farms and urban developers took over large parts of the forests where they live&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt; The availability of the palm tree species from which they get the nuts to feed on is crucial for their continued survival.

The species is being threatened by habitat destruction as the reed beds where it lives are being burned and the lake drained for rice irrigation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They are also caught for food and others are captured and sold as pets who rarely survive, meaning they are classed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).

A rare banteng &amp;ndash; a species of wild cattle from south east Asia - has been born at Chester Zoo. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 8,000 individuals are left in the wild, largely due to the loss of their forest habitat and hunting.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The male calf &amp;ndash; who is yet to be named &amp;ndash; arrived to mum Pankhuri and dad Gaston.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also known as tembadau, the banteng is a species of wild cattle native to the forests of south east Asia. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Banteng are listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) who say the species has declined by 95 percent since the 1960s. Hunting for the trade in their horns, meat and traditional medicines and the accelerated loss of their forest habitat are just two factors which have reduced their numbers to an estimated 5,000 - 8,000 in the wild. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Curator of mammals Tim Rowlands said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;South east Asia is home to some of the most threatened species on the planet and it&amp;rsquo;s frightening to think that on a busy summer day, more people will visit Chester Zoo than there are banteng left in the wild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hopefully our new young boy &amp;ndash; who is doing very well indeed &amp;ndash; will inspire a few more people to take notice of this very special species. Better still we hope he&amp;rsquo;ll connect them with the plight of his cousins in the wild. The name &amp;lsquo;wild cattle&amp;rsquo; maybe doesn&amp;rsquo;t conjure up images of a species under threat but with only a few thousand left, there&amp;rsquo;s no doubt that this magnificent animal faces an uncertain future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new youngster is the third calf to be born in Chester following Penni and Gus who both arrived in May 2013. The zoo now has a herd of six &amp;ndash; three males and three females.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In spring 2015 the herd will move into a whole new area of the zoo when we open our &lt;a href=\"/islands/islands-news\"&gt;Islands project&lt;/a&gt;. As a visitor to Islands you will go on an expedition &amp;ndash; moving through detailed recreations of habitats in the Philippines, Bali, Sulawesi, Papua, Sumba and Sumatra. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope that the development, the biggest and most ambitions in UK zoo history, will showcase its conservation work in south east Asia and highlight the threats faced by species such as Sumatran orangutan, Sumatran tigers, Visayan warty pigs and Bali starlings as well as banteng. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Banteng - Chester ZOo\" src=\"/~/media/pr-folder/Banteng18 Custom.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Banteng facts&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt;     &lt;li&gt;The zoo&amp;rsquo;s new youngster was born on May 9&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;In the wild, the once-thriving species has been reduced to small, isolated populations whose numbers are in decline and are at risk from a host of threats including poaching inside protected areas, habitat loss, hybridisation with domestic cattle and infections from domestic cattle diseases&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;Banteng play a key role in circulating nutrients through ecosystems, dispersing seeds and maintaining food chains. They are and are a critical food source for many carnivore species, including tigers and leopards&lt;/li&gt;     &lt;li&gt;On June 4 2014, Fauna and Flora International (FFI) announced the discovery of a new population of banteng (Bos javanicus) in north-western Cambodia.

However a new breeding programme, which began last year when a small number of adult females from a donor site at Winmarleigh where a healthy population of the butterflies still exist, were taken to the zoo. And under the guidance of the zoo&amp;rsquo;s experts, the butterflies were bred under controlled conditions and are now being released as adult butterflies onto Heysham Moss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=\"video\"&gt;   &lt;iframe frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/xWZu0kPcgvs?rel=0\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__top\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__right\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__bottom\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=\"video-mask video-mask__left\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo&amp;rsquo;s biodiversity officer Sarah Bird said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to be able to support this project financially and particularly thrilled to be able to use zoo expertise and facilities to help restore large heath butterflies to Heysham Moss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It has been fascinating to follow the life cycle of this rare butterfly at the zoo and we&amp;rsquo;re extremely pleased that the pupae we have so carefully reared are now hatching at Heysham Moss, their new home.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Wildlife Trust&amp;rsquo;s North Lancashire Reserves manager Reuben Neville added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;After a year of anticipation and the first phase of the project now completed, seeing the first large heath butterflies flying again on our reserve has been incredibly exciting and a credit to the zoo staff who have nurtured them over the past year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The large heath butterfly was formerly much more widespread in North West England, inhabiting lowland raised bog and occasionally blanket bog habitats.

Bernardo the male spectacled bear arrives in new Chester Zoo breeding plan</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A young male bear has arrived at Chester Zoo from the USA to be part of the zoo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds future plans to breed the animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Spectacled bear\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/bears/spectacled-bear-600-px.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Four-year-old spectacled bear Bernardo relaxes his new enclosure at Chester Zoo after arriving from Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=\"line-height: 1.3;\"&gt;Four-year-old Bernardo &amp;ndash; a spectacled bear &amp;ndash; has moved in to the Cheshire zoo after travelling from Tulsa Zoo in Oklahoma. He is slowly being introduced to his new companion, Chester&amp;rsquo;s resident female Franka.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is rare that any zoo animals move between Europe and the USA. However, Bernardo&amp;rsquo;s arrival brings important new blood to the European population of spectacled bears &amp;ndash; a species classed by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being vulnerable to extinction in the wild. Tim Rowlands, the zoo&amp;rsquo;s curator of mammals said:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;An exchange of animals between the USA and Europe doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen very often at all. That makes the arrival of Bernardo even more special.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The co-ordinator of this breeding programme chose him as an ideal genetic pairing for our female Franka and so that has been the driver for bringing him across the Atlantic. Spectacled bears are a species that is vulnerable to extinction and so we hope this pair will produce cubs in the future. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bringing an animal over from the USA is logistically very difficult and it&amp;rsquo;s vitally important that the animal has a suitable temperament. I went over to Tulsa last year to see Bernardo and spend some time with him and he&amp;rsquo;s a very nice, calm young male.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We also have one of the largest spectacled bear enclosures in the world and so we were top of the list when it came to choosing Bernardo&amp;rsquo;s new home.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;To ensure Bernardo was made as comfortable as possible during the 4,300 mile journey, a specially designed, purpose-built crate was made in Deeside in north Wales before being flown over to Tulsa. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Rowlands added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bernardo arrived safely and is spending time exploring his new home. Both he and Franka are finding ways of getting to know each other &amp;ndash; and that may involve a little bit of rough and tumble - but they&amp;rsquo;ll soon settle down. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Spectacled bears are by and large a mysterious species and not a great deal is known about them. But by working closely with him here, we hope our keepers will learn new things and be able to relay that information to our conservation partners in the wild - information that could be very useful indeed in terms of ensuring the bears&amp;rsquo; long-term survival.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last year the zoo funded a project in Peru investigating the foraging behaviour of spectacled bears. The project ultimately aims to ensure the conservation of the species in the dry forest habitat of northern Peru through scientific research and education, while working collaboratively with private land owners and rural communities to improve their social and economic wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;More pics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Spectacled bear\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/bears/Bernie-33.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Spectacled bear at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/bears/Bernie-11.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;figure&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-wrapper\"&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Spectacled bears\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/bears/Bernie-38.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;div class=\"figure-image-mask\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:03 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{BB68E817-021A-43D2-9D1F-246C33BEB375}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rooney-the-penguin-chick</link><title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdRooney\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the penguin chick begins training as keepers kick off their 2014 penguin cr\\ufffd\\ufffdche at Chester Zoo</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/~/media/news/2014/rooney/Rooney the penguin chick at Chester Zoo (6).ashx\" alt=\"Rooney the penguin chick at Chester Zoo \" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"font-size: 11px; text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight-week-old penguin chick Rooney is held aloft by keeper Karen Neech at Chester Zoo.

We kick off their education with lessons in and around our shallow nursery pool where the main goal is to build up their confidence. Then, when we&amp;rsquo;re happy they can take fish from our keepers and no longer need to rely on regurgitated food from mum and dad, they graduate to our main pool. Here they continue the learning process by following the lead of the adults in the colony.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The penguins are an endangered South American species, which come from the coastal areas of Peru and Chile. The new arrivals mean the zoo now has a colony of 42.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/~/media/news/2014/rooney/Banks the penguin chick at Chester Zoo.ashx\" alt=\"Banks the penguin chick at Chester Zoo\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mr Woolham added:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rooney is so far showing a great appetite for learning.

Now extinct in Cheshire, Greater Manchester and Merseyside, the Large Heath butterfly hangs on in just two widely separated sites in Lancashire.  One is on the Bowland Fells, the other Winmarleigh Moss SSSI. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Now with funding from the Lancashire Environmental Fund and project partners Chester Zoo it is hoped to re-establish a sustainable population at Heysham. &amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo recognises that conservation is as important here in Britain as it is elsewhere, and works with many partners on UK conservation projects. Biodiversity Officer Sarah Bird says, &amp;ldquo;We are excited to be able to support this project financially and particularly thrilled to be able to use zoo expertise and facilities to help restore Large Heath butterflies to Heysham Moss. It has been fascinating to follow the life cycle of this rare butterfly at Chester Zoo and we are thrilled that the pupae we have so carefully reared are now hatching at Heysham Moss, their new home. Good luck butterflies!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The captive breeding programme began in 2013, when a small number of adult females from the donor site at Winmarleigh, which stills supports a healthy population, were taken to Chester Zoo. Under the guidance of experts at the Zoo, these butterflies have been bred under controlled conditions throughout their life cycle, and are now being released as adult butterflies onto Heysham Moss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since the Trust purchased Heysham Moss in 2004 extensive habitat management work has been undertaken, and the habitat is now considered sufficient to support a population of the Large Heath butterfly.  The two main requirements are tussocks of Hare&amp;rsquo;s Tail Cotton Grass Eriophorum vaginatum; the larval foodplant, and Cross-leaved Heath Erica tetralix; the main nectar source.  Both are present in sufficient quantities, and recent land management work undertaken last winter will provide further areas for both plants to prosper.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The project will continue with a further year of captive breeding, and a second release phase onto the reserve at Heysham Moss in 2015.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wildlife Trust for Lancashire, Manchester and North Merseyside is dedicated to the protection and promotion of the wildlife in Lancashire, seven boroughs of Greater Manchester and four of Merseyside, all lying north of the River Mersey.

But it&amp;rsquo;s very, very difficult indeed to tell the ages of young orangutans. So, if a rehabilitated youngster is thought to be eight years old but is actually only five, this can potentially affect its chances of survival when it&amp;rsquo;s reintroduced into the forest. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s where dental emergence studies on zoo-based orangutans which, we of course know the dates of birth of, could be highly relevant for improved age assignment of confiscated orphans in Indonesia and Malaysia. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is an excellent example of how zoos, and captive populations of species, can aid conservation efforts in the wild.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keepers at the zoo are now busy recording when first teeth start to appear before they later wobble and fall out. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Whereas most people don&amp;rsquo;t tend to look forward to a trip to the dentist, our orangutans seem to really like having their teeth checked,&amp;rdquo; &lt;/strong&gt;said primate keeper Kate Brice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s because to encourage them to open nice and wide we often use honey which we smear on a surface for them to lick off. As soon as they come over we then have to take a photograph of the insides of their mouths as quick as we can, as before you know it the honey is gone! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Currently we&amp;rsquo;re monitoring baby tooth timings for our two young Sumatran orangutans - Tripa and Tuti - who are both just over one year old. We first saw signs of teeth when they reached five months.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We know orangutans have 20 baby teeth and 32 permanent adult teeth but what we need answers to in particular is whether or not timings relating to the development of permanent incisors, canines and premolars is different in males and females and between Sumatran and Bornean species of orangutans.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Felcity Oram, programme development advisor and PhD student with the orangutan research unit of Chester&amp;rsquo;s Zoo&amp;rsquo;s partner in the field &amp;ndash; Hutan/Kinabatangan Orangutan Conservation Programme (KOCP), added: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Better understanding of basic life history is important in order to ensure the continued viability of orangutans in the wild, especially as they increasingly live in human-transformed landscapes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Orangutans - or old man of the forest as they are also known - are one of human&amp;rsquo;s closest relatives. But in the wild the demand for timber, palm oil, roads, agricultural land and space for mining means huge areas of forest have now been lost, taking with it the homes of both Bornean and Sumatran orangutans and pushing them perilously close to extinction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In October, Chester Zoo is launching a campaign to help further protect orangutans in the wild. Go Orange for Orangutans will urge schools, families, businesses and individuals to help do their bit to save the critically endangered animals. All funds raised through the campaign will help conservationists continue their work to protect orangutans in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra.

They live up to 15 years and can grow as large as 113kg. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Warthog facts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Warthogs have one or two pairs of warts on their face beneath the eyes and near the tusks &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Males are larger than females but both sexes have upper and lower tusks &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; They feed mainly on grass, roots, bark, fruit and berries but will sometimes eat insects, worms and dead animals &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Warthogs are found in sub-Saharan Africa &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; They are active in the day and hide away at night, most often in burrows that have been made by aardvarks &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Mother warthogs nurse and care for their offspring until they are about 21 weeks of age, at which point they have to fend for themselves &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s new youngsters were born on 2/5/2014 &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; They can be seen in the zoo&amp;rsquo;s Tsavo exhibit, near its Diamond Jubilee Quarter &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img alt=\"Warthog at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/warthogs/Warthogs-1.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Proud father, Magnum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;img src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/warthogs/Warthogs-3.ashx\" alt=\"Warthog piglets born at Chester Zoo\" /&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:03 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{52E3C717-44B8-4B9B-B691-46B8B68D852A}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/rare-visayan-warty-piglet-born</link><title>Chester Zoo celebrates birth of rare Visayan warty piglet</title><description>&lt;p&gt;An extremely rare piglet has been born at Chester Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Visayan warty piglet\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/visayan-warty-pig/WartyPig-14.ashx\" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt; &lt;em&gt;A rare, week-old warty piglet peeps out from between the legs of its mum Viv after being born at Chester Zoo &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only 200 Visayan warty pigs are thought to be left in their native habitat in the Philippines &amp;ndash; making them the rarest of all wild pigs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The decline of the species - almost to the point of extinction - is blamed on habitat loss and hunting. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Keeper Lucy Edwards said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Visayan warty pigs are critically endangered and face an extremely high risk of becoming extinct in the wild. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;ve suffered a drastic population crash in recent times with widespread commercial logging, illegal logging and agricultural expansion devastating vast amounts of their natural habitat. They&amp;rsquo;re also being over-hunted and their meat can often command at least double the price of domestic pork in local markets and some restaurants. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It really is a battle against time to save them.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo was the first in the UK to welcome Visayan warty pigs, a species that gets its name from three pairs of fleshy warts on the boar's face. The warts protect them from rival pigs' tusks during a fight. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The sex of the zoo&amp;rsquo;s latest youngster &amp;ndash; which was born to mum Viv (8) and dad Sid (7) - is still unknown. It currently sports yellow and brown stripes which act as camouflage but these will eventually disappear at around 9-12 months. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Visayan warty piglet at Chester Zoo\" src=\"/~/media/Images/Animals/Mammals/hoofed-animals/visayan-warty-pig/WartyPig-12.ashx\" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lucy added: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Given that warty pigs have a spiky, almost mohawk-like hair style on their heads, mum Viv and dad Sid were named after punk rockers &amp;ndash; Vivienne Westwood and Sid Vicious. Once we discover the gender of our new little addition I&amp;rsquo;m sure we&amp;rsquo;ll be giving him or her a name to follow in that tradition.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next spring the zoo&amp;rsquo;s new Islands development &amp;ndash; a &amp;pound;30m expansion which aims to showcase its conservation work in South East Asia &amp;ndash; will open. Islands will feature mini-replicas of several islands including the Philippines and aims to further champion the plight of species such as the Visayan warty pig. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The zoo provides financial assistance for an education and breeding programme in the Philippines and is also working with other European zoos to ensure the survival of the pigs. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Visayan warty pig facts &lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; The Visayan warty pig is a small, forest-dwelling pig &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Little is known about the species and few behavioural studies have occurred in the wild &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; They stay in small groups but often males will be alone &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Male Visayan warty pigs have tough spikey hair with an unusual looking mane and crest &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Visayan warty pigs eat roots, forest fruits, cereal and vegetable crops &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; They are found in patches of the remaining rainforest on the Visayan islands in the central Philippines &lt;br /&gt; &amp;bull; Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s latest arrival is vitally important to the breeding programme which is looking to maintain a genetically viable population of Visayan warty pigs in zoos around Europe &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:03 Z</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{7E571350-A0CD-45ED-8CEC-62D884AE0F32}</guid><link>http://www.chesterzoo.org/global/press-and-media/press-releases/nature-reserve-opening</link><title>Zoo branches out to boost wildlife</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A WILDLIFE haven specially created to help UK native species has opened at Chester Zoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/~/media/Images/Must sees/nature-reserve/nature-reserve640x412.ashx\" alt=\"Nature reserve\" style=\"width: 495px; height: 319px;\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The two-acre nature reserve highlights a traditional Cheshire landscape and is already home to a wide variety of local wildlife including birds, mammals and insects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reserve has been developed with wildflower meadows, 150 native trees, a wildlife pond and a grass amphitheatre which will be used for environmentally-themed events and as an outside classroom for schools. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sarah Bird, Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s biodiversity officer, said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Chester Zoo&amp;rsquo;s conservation activities extend far beyond the zoo animals we know and love. We believe conservation begins at home and in the UK we are responsible for looking after native species right here on our doorstep. The nature reserve is already home to some amazing species such as the sparrowhawk which our experts have spotted, and the hedgehog we&amp;rsquo;ve caught on camera traps. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By opening up this beautiful and tranquil area to the public we aim to inspire people to take a longer look at the nature around them and discover how they can play their part in looking after it.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/~/media/Images/Must sees/nature-reserve/KFP_9686.ashx\" alt=\"School children in the Nature Reserve\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Youngsters from Acresfield Primary School, Upton, were the first to try out the nature reserve during the opening as they take part helping to identify bugs and insects. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chester Zoo trustee and horticulture expert Professor Stefan Buczacki, who spent 12 years a panel member and chairman of BBC Radio 4&amp;rsquo;s Gardeners&amp;rsquo; Question Time, opened the site. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nature reserve will be open during normal zoo hours &amp;ndash; www.chesterzoo.org for details. It will be free of charge and accessible to the public without them having to enter the zoo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/~/media/Images/Must sees/nature-reserve/KFP_9648.ashx\" alt=\"Dr Mark Pilgrim, Rebecca Burke-Sharples and Professor Stefan Buczacki\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;Professor Stefan Buczacki, Chester Zoo trustee Rebecca Burke-Sharples and Chester Zoo's director general Dr Mark Pilgrim opened the nature reserve&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:58:03 Z</pubDate></item></channel></rss>",
