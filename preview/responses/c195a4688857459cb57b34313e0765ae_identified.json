Important issues have been raised in relation to both the interpretation of scientific knowledge, especially in making predictions of future developments, and the procedures used by the IPCC in its assessment.</p> <p>With more than 450 lead authors, 800 contributing authors, and 2500 reviewers from more than 130 countries, the IPCC 4th Assessment Report represents the most comprehensive international scientific assessment ever conducted. This assessment reflects the current collective knowledge on the climate system, its evolution to date, and its anticipated future development. It is now apparent, and given the scale of the enterprise not surprising, that some errors did occur in part of the report. However, in proportion to the sheer volume of the research reviewed and analyzed, these lapses of accuracy are minor and they in no way undermine the main conclusions. It should be noted that the errors were initially revealed and made public by scientists and the misinterpretations can now be corrected accordingly. Rather than compromising the integrity and credibility of the science of climate change, this series of events is in itself a demonstration of the vigour and rigour of the scientific process.</p> <p>In any area of science it is important that errors, or previous assumptions that change in the light of new evidence, are openly admitted and corrected. This is especially the case for the IPCC reports, which have broad and deep implications for societal choices and policy. Lessons should be learnt from the current controversy. The IPCC processes are tried and tested but they are not infallible (and have never been presented as such by the scientific community). In the light of recent events, it is timely to review these processes to see whether modifications can be made that i) reduce the chance of errors being introduced in the first place, and ii) optimise the mechanisms for identifying and correcting errors that do inadvertently remain in the final IPCC reports. The procedures for the IPCC assessments engage not only the scientific community, but also governmental agencies. They are complicated and not always easily understood by those not directly involved. It is important to continue to strive to make these processes as transparent and accountable as possible.</p> <p>The identified errors in the IPCC report are regrettable but, in the context of the complex IPCC process, understandable. That these errors have resulted in attempts to discredit the main conclusions of the report, accusations of scientific conspiracies, and personal attacks on scientists is unacceptable. Scientific assessments, such as those of the IPCC, are a crucial basis for making the decisions that will shape our society now and in the future. Scientists, governments, and other societal stakeholders need to work together to ensure the quality and relevance of such assessments. We need to learn from the current controversy and make improvements where necessary. We should be grateful to the many thousands of scientists who give freely of their time to contribute to the IPCC and other scientific assessments. And we should continue to be critical but constructively so and in ways that openly recognize the strengths and limitations of the scientific process itself.</p> <h3>About this statement</h3> <p>This statement is endorsed by the Officers of the International Council for Science (ICSU, February, 2010).

This review was required as an input to decisions about the future of SCOPE which ICSU expect to make during 2008. A Reference Group was established to help the consultant with the review, and detailed Terms of Reference were specified.</p> <p>Answers to the questions posed in the Terms of Reference were based on an analysis of responses to a web based questionnaire which was sent to 370 individuals who have been associated with the work of SCOPE over the past five years. The analysis also took into account interviews which the consultant held with approximately fifty key informants. Reports and accounts were also consulted and analysed.</p> <p>The results of the review demonstrate that SCOPE has had an illustrious past and particularly in its early days made many contributions to knowledge and to policy. More recently several new organizations have been established which work at the science and environment interface. These provide competition for SCOPE\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds scientific assessments. They also provide competition for available financial and human resources. The financial situation facing SCOPE is now acute with funding for the Secretariat and administrative costs exceeding the subscription fees from its Members by more than $50,000 per annum. One of the main reasons for this situation is that the fees are paid in dollars and about 50% of the expenses are spent in Euros. The loss in value of the dollar has not been matched by increases in subscription fees.</p> <p>The review identifies the strengths and weaknesses of SCOPE. Most of these had been identified in a previous review in 2003, and are well known both to the SCOPE Executive Committee and to the SCOPE Secretariat. Some measures have been taken to overcome the weaknesses over the past five years, but the financial situation has meant there are still many problems which remain to be solved.</p> <p>Four alternative options were identified for the future of the organization. These were the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmore of the same\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd option; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe rejuvenation or re-invention\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd option; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe merger\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd option; and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe closure\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd option. The majority of the people interviewed favoured the rejuvenation or re-invention option, although about a fifth was in favour of the merger or closure options. Very few people thought that SCOPE could survive by doing more of the same.</p> <p>The final section of the report contains the consultant\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds personal comments and conclusions. It is recommended that there should be a set of consultations and meetings which explore the needs for a SCOPE type organization given the activities of other organizations working on scientific assessments, before final decisions about the future of SCOPE are taken.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacinta Legg</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environment</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Reviews</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Assessments</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Science for Policy</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2008-03-16T00:10:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/icsu-africa/events/regional-events/call-for-nominations-for-the-2013-l2019oreal-unesco-awards-for-women-in-science-dedicated-to-the-physical-sciences\">     <title>Call for Nominations for the 2013 L\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOR\\ufffd\\ufffdAL-UNESCO Awards For Women in Science dedicated to the Physical Sciences</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/icsu-africa/events/regional-events/call-for-nominations-for-the-2013-l2019oreal-unesco-awards-for-women-in-science-dedicated-to-the-physical-sciences</link>     <description>Submissions for candidates for the 2013 L\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOR\\ufffd\\ufffdAL-UNESCO Awards in Physical Sciences are requested.
