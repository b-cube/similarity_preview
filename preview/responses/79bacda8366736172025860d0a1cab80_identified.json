Normally any FIRM that has associated flood profiles has cross sections. The corresponding attribute table contains information about cross section lines. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. These lines represent the locations of channel surveys performed for input into the hydraulic model used to calculate flood elevations. These locations are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. All cross sections for which a spatial location is available should be included in this table. The spatial elements representing cross sections are lines generally extending from outside the floodplain, across the entire floodplain and out the other side. Each cross section should be represented by a single line feature without the hexagons shown on each end on the hardcopy map. The location and shape of the lines should depict as accurately as possible the position of the cross section used. This is a modified Standard DFIRM Database table that includes Standard DFIRM Database items and Enhanced Database items. All items after SOURCE_CIT are Enhanced. The Enhanced DFIRM Database must contain all modeled cross sections, whether they are printed on the FIRM or not.</abstract>       <purpose>The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act, which &quot;... requires the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the aquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in indentified areas having special flood hazards,&apos;&apos; Section 2 (b) (4) of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973. In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.&quot; The DFIRM Database presents the flood risk information depicted on the FIRM in a digital format suitable for use in electronic mapping applications. The DFIRM database is a subset of the Digital FIS database that serves to archive the information collected during the FIS. </purpose>       <supplinf>Minnesota</supplinf>     </descript>      <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <sngdate>           <caldate>2006 - Present</caldate>         </sngdate>       </timeinfo>       <current>FEMA DFIRM CD-ROM Release Date for each county.</current>     </timeperd>      <status>       <progress>In Work</progress>       <update>As Needed</update>     </status>          <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-96.5</westbc>         <eastbc>-89</eastbc>         <northbc>49.5</northbc>         <southbc>43</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>      <keywords>       <theme>         <themekey>FEMA flood hazard zone DFIRM database DFIRM Special Flood Hazard Area Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map Flooding Base Flood Elevation SFHA Flood Insurance Rate Map Floodway </themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekey>Minnesota</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>      <accconst>None</accconst>     <useconst>Acknowledgment of FEMA would be appreciated in products derived from these data.

Likewise, flood elevations at the confluence of streams studied independently are checked to ensure agreement at the confluence. The FIRM and the FIS are developed together and care is taken to ensure that the elevations and other features shown on the flood profiles in the FIS agree with the information shown on the FIRM. However, the elevations as shown on the FIRM are rounded whole-foot elevations.
