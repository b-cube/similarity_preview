The program is funded by the El Paso Electric Power Company and is being offered at no cost to participants. SCORE is a voluntary program that offers objective, third party consulting on best practices in the areas of energy usage and energy efficiency. No products or services are sold through the SCORE Program. Customized energy performance benchmarking, energy master planning workshops, technical energy efficiency assistance, communications and public relations support, and cash incentives are available.</literal></binding>   </result>   <result>    <binding name=\"incentive_name\"><literal>El Paso Electric Company - Small System Renewable Energy Certificate Purchase Program (New Mexico)</literal></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_page\"><uri>http://en.openei.org/wiki/El_Paso_Electric_Company_-_Small_System_Renewable_Energy_Certificate_Purchase_Program_(New_Mexico)</uri></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_type\"><literal>Financial Incentive Programs</literal></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_descr\"><literal datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">Effective January 1, 2010, El Paso Electric is purchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs) from its New Mexico customers who install small photovoltaic (PV) systems and wind systems up to 10 kilowatts (kW) in capacity and medium systems between 10 kW and 100 kW. The RECs that El Paso Electric purchases will help the utility comply with [http://www.dsireusa.org/library/includes/incentive2.cfm?Incentive_Code=NM05R&amp;state=NM&amp;CurrentPageID=1 New Mexico&#39;s renewable portfolio standard] (RPS) in exchange for a financial incentive to homeowners and businesses who install PV and wind energy systems.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;  Only systems connected to the utility&#39;s grid and net-metered are eligible. RECs will be measured by a separate REC meter and purchased by El Paso Electric on a monthly basis. For contracts signed on or after January 1, 2014, the utility will purchase the REC&#39;s from a PV or wind system at a rate of $0.02 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for small systems and medium systems.    Payments will not be made for any RECs produced by a medium system that are in excess of the kWh consumed by the site during a month. Payments will be made for a period of 8 years. REC purchase payments will appear as a credit on the customer&#39;s monthly bill. Any credit balance up to $30.00 will be applied to the following month&#39;s bill. Once the rolling credit exceeds $30.00 a direct payment will be made to the customer.

These rules, adopted in July 2008, revised and clarified the state&#39;s existing rules. Rule 569 applies to all qualifying facilities (QFs) under PURPA, which generally includes all renewable-energy systems and combined-heat-and-power (CHP) systems up to 80 megawatts (MW) in capacity.  Rule 568 applies to renewable-energy systems and CHP systems up to 10 MW in capacity. The purpose of Rule 568 is to simplify the interconnection requirements for QFs up to 10 MW and to encourage the use of small-scale, customer-owned renewables or alternative energy resources. All utilities subject to PRC jurisdiction must offer net metering and must comply with these standards. (Municipal utilities, which are not regulated by the commission, are exempt.)  Interconnection applications will generally follow this review path:      * Systems up to 10 kilowatts (kW) in capacity are eligible for the &quot;Simplified Interconnection Process,&quot; which includes simplified applications.     * Systems greater than 10 kW and up to 2 MW are eligible for the &quot;Fast Track Process,&quot; which might include supplemental review.     * Systems greater than 2 MW and up to 10 MW must follow the &quot;Full Interconnection Study Process.&quot;     * Systems greater than 10 MW must follow the &quot;Case Specific Study Process.&quot;  All systems must comply with all relevant local and national standards (including the NEC, IEEE and UL standards), and must meet any additional requirements approved by the PRC. A redundant external disconnect device is required for all interconnected systems. For systems greater than 10 kW, the disconnect switch must be visibly marked and accessible to and lockable by the utility.  The PRC may require the owner of a generating facility with a rated capacity of up to 250 kW to obtain general liability insurance prior to connecting with a utility if the utility provides a sufficient reason for doing so. A utility may directly and independently require owners of systems greater than 250 kW to provide proof of insurance, with reasonable limits not to exceed $1 million, or other reasonable evidence of financial responsibility. A mutual indemnification agreement between the customer and the utility is required.  Interconnected customers must pay an application fee that varies according to the size of the system. Systems up to 10 kW must pay $50; systems greater than 10 kW and up to 100 kW must pay $100; and systems greater 100 kW must pay $100 plus $1 per kW. In addition to these fees, a small utility with fewer than 50,000 customers may charge reasonable consulting fees for systems greater than 10 kW.</literal></binding>   </result>   <result>    <binding name=\"incentive_name\"><literal>Solar Access Laws (New Mexico)</literal></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_page\"><uri>http://en.openei.org/wiki/Solar_Access_Laws_(New_Mexico)</uri></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_type\"><literal>Rules Regulations Policies Incentive Programs</literal></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_descr\"><literal datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">New Mexico&#39;s Solar Rights and Solar Recordation Acts (both contained in NMSA \\ufffd\\ufffd 47-3) allow property owners to create solar easements for the purpose of protecting and maintaining proper access to sunlight.  The Solar Rights Act established the right to use solar energy as a property right.  The solar right prevents neighboring property owners from constructing new buildings or planting new trees which would block their access to the sun.   The Solar Recordation Act explains the procedures for filing a solar right through the County Clerk&#39;s Office.  The property owner seeking the solar right must give advanced notice to the adjacent property owners, who are entitled to contest the claim.  Once awarded, the solar right is attached to the property and will remain in effect even if the property is sold.  The solar right, however, can be bought and sold separately from the property.  This allows a neighboring property owner to purchase the solar right and then cancel it.  The Solar Rights Act and the Solar Recordation Act also include provisions allowing local governments to create their own ordinances or zoning rules pertaining to the protection of solar rights.   In May 2007, SB 1031 strengthened solar access rights in New Mexico by limiting the ability of a county or municipality to restrict the placement of solar collectors unless the location is within a historic district. SB 1031 also voided all covenants and restrictions (from July 1, 1978 forward) that effectively prohibit the installation of solar collectors.</literal></binding>   </result>   <result>    <binding name=\"incentive_name\"><literal>Solar Easements &amp; Rights Laws (New Mexico)</literal></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_page\"><uri>http://en.openei.org/wiki/Solar_Easements_%26_Rights_Laws_(New_Mexico)</uri></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_type\"><literal>Rules Regulations Policies Incentive Programs</literal></binding>    <binding name=\"incentive_descr\"><literal datatype=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string\">New Mexico&#39;s Solar Rights and Solar Recordation Acts (both contained in NMSA \\ufffd\\ufffd 47-3) allow property owners to create solar easements for the purpose of protecting and maintaining proper access to sunlight.
