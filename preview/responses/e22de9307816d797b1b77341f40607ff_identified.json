The journal was inspired by the fact that, while many undergraduates produce exceptional scholarship, most do not get an opportunity to share their work with the wider academic community. Some may go on to postgraduate study in the same field of study as their undergraduate degree, but most will not continue in academia, or if they do, they will often change subfield. Meanwhile, the research they produce for a class, a dissertation, or a thesis will end up in a university library archive or, much more likely, buried in the folders of their personal computer. It is my belief that this is a disservice to both the student and the academic community at large. This journal was founded in the spirit of giving excellent undergraduate work the exposure and longevity that it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Lauren Hall-Lew</dc:creator>           <prism:volume>1</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1178\">        <title>Pulling Out All the Stops: Referee Design and Phonetic Correlates of Gay Men\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds English</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1178</link>            <description>&lt;p class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;Studies of intraspeaker variation and the linguistic indexing of sexual identity have formed an important part of recent research in variationist sociolinguistics. This study investigates patterns of word-final stop release in the speech of a flamboyantly gay television host, Graham Norton. The results indicate a significant correlation between the rate of released word-final stops and the sexual orientation of an absent referee, as defined by Bell (1984, 2001), with a higher proportion of released stops for gay-identified referees. We argue that this pattern demonstrates the linguistic indexing of an ingroup identity, which Norton shares with referees who identify as gay. In this way, the variable of word-final stop release can be considered a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbuilding block\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (Barrett 2002:33) in the construction of Norton&#039;s sexual identity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Victoria Dickson</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Yorath Turner</dc:creator>           <prism:volume>1</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1179\">        <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMy Vocal Cords are Made of Tweed\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: Style-Shifting as Speaker Design</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1179</link>            <description>Intraspeaker variation is evaluated in terms of speaker design in a number of studies (Coupland 1985, Schilling-Estes 1998, Podesva 2008). This study explores possible motives for variation from a speaker design perspective through the analysis of three phonetic variables with differing social status. The variables occur in the speech of Stephen Fry, an intellectual whose public identity is closely linked with his Received Pronunciation (RP) speech. Fry uses more non-standard forms in contexts where his identity is more directly relevant, suggesting his desire to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdaccentuate the positive and eliminate the negative\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd associations of the RP register (Meyerhoff 2011:28). However not all the data fit this pattern, demonstrating the need for a broad model of speaker design incorporating multiple motives for style-shifting. It is proposed that the use of linguistic variables with differing social evaluation can give insight into prioritisation of speaker motives in future speaker-centred studies.</description>            <dc:creator>Melissa Geere</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Joy Everett</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Alasdair MacLeod</dc:creator>           <prism:volume>1</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1180\">        <title>Creaky Voice as a Stylistic Feature of Young American Female Speech: An Intraspeaker Variation Study of Scarlett Johansson</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1180</link>            <description>This study examines the stylistic use of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcreaky voice\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in a single speaker: the American actress Scarlett Johansson. Recently, there has been a marked increase in both media and academic interest in creaky voice, with work by Yuasa (2010) and Wolk et al. (2011) confirming the prevalence of this feature among young American female speakers. Our study was directly motivated by the work of Barry Pennock-Speck (2005), who took a qualitative approach to analyzing the speech of three American actresses for stylistic modulation of their voice quality. The present study focuses on only one American actress (Johansson), who was chosen as she is an established, successful young American female (at time of research) and therefore was an appropriate subject to represent the social group we are discussing. Our materials included six of Johansson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds films that were developed whilst she was between the ages 18\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd24. This age range falls in line with previous work on creaky voice (Wolk et al. 2011) who defined their age bracket of study as 18\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd25 years old. We contrasted American and British character roles and noted the level of creak present through both quantitative and qualitative analysis of six films: three in which she played an American and three in which she took on an English (UK) accent. Acoustic data evaluation involved coding for creak on syllabic nuclei and carrying out a statistical analysis to determine significant influences on the pattern we observed. Our qualitative analysis covers the following variables: character traits and personality, time period in which the film is set, and the age of Johansson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds character. Results showed that there was significantly more creak in Johansson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds speech while she was performing in an American role, in line with the study previously conducted by Pennock-Speck. Our qualitative findings suggest that creak is modulated at an additional level, indexing seductiveness and intimacy with the interlocutor.</description>            <dc:creator>Francesca Shaw</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Victoria Crocker</dc:creator>           <prism:volume>1</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1181\">        <title>Pitch Change in Dog-Directed Speech</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/1181</link>            <description>Humans cannot help changing their speech in different situations. This kind of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdintraspeaker variation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd happens every day when news-reporters turn from talking to their colleagues to talking to the camera, or when people suddenly start speaking in a strong dialect when talking with their family. People not only change the way they speak to different people, they also change the way they speak when not talking to people at all. This study examines one speaker and her dog, the goal being to find out why humans change the way they speak when talking to dogs. Dog-Directed Speech (DDS) is characterised by having a high fundamental frequency (pitch), as well as large amounts of questions and imperative utterances (Hirsh-Pasek and Treiman 1982, Burnham et al. 2002, Mitchell 2001). In order to take both of these features into account, we measured and compared the mean pitch of different speech acts which we expected to be common in DDS: disapproving utterances (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStay\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd), approving utterances (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGood boy!\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd), and questions (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWho\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds a good boy?\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). We wanted to see whether the frequency of certain speech acts in DDS has anything to do with its high pitch and high pitch range. Although we did find variation in the pitch of different speech acts, we do not think that this explains the high pitch and pitch range of DDS. Rather, we conclude that DDS is motivated by social norms associated with talking to dogs. Our findings can give us insight into sociolinguistics in general because they show us that we respond to social norms that come with the speech situation, as well as just responding to the way our audience talks.</description>            <dc:creator>Christy C.
