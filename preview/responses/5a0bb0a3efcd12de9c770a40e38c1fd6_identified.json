Despite extensive deployment and continued service of these systems, little research has focused on the seismic performance and rehabilitation of older braced frames, termed non-seismic concentrically braced frames (NCBFs). Such frames were designed prior to the advent of capacity design standards and lack details and brace section geometry that promote ductility and sustain resistance, such as adequate gusset plate rotational clearance, minimum weld toughness, and brace compactness limits. Beams in NCBFs with braces in chevron configurations (V and inverted V) are commonly unable to develop the design brace unbalanced load specified in the 2010 AISC Seismic Provisions that arises after brace buckling. NCBFs with these weak beams are the primary subject of this research program. Two-story experimental specimens with braces in the inverted V configuration were tested at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering in Taiwan to examine the seismic response of a prototypical existing NCBF and three rehabilitation schemes. The results show that poor brace compactness and connection details can be highly detrimental to system performance, but weak beam braced frames with ductile details can achieve good ductility while maintaining strength. Numerical models of the specimens, developed in Abaqus, simulate the observed response well and provide a validated basis for future analyses.

Yetemen, Omer - The role of solar radiation on ecohydrologic fluxes, vegetation dynamics, species composition, and landscape morphology has long been documented in field studies. However, these studies miss the value offered by a numerical modeling approach that integrates a range of ecohydrologic and geomorphic processes in exploring the landscape response to multiple controlling factors. This study represented flood generation and solar-radiation-driven echydrologic dynamics in a landscape evolution model (LEM) to investigate how ecohydrologic differences caused by differential irradiance on opposing hillslopes manifest themselves on the organization of modeled topography, soil moisture, and plant biomass. We use the CHILD (Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development) LEM equipped with a spatially-distributed solar-radiation component, leading to spatial patterns of soil moisture; a vegetation dynamics component that explicitly tracks above- and below-ground biomass; and a runoff component that allows for runoff-runon processes along landscape flow paths. This study starts with data analysis, and then followed by a modeling part. In the first part, the relationship between land surface properties (e.g. soil, vegetation, and lithology) and landscape morphology quantified by the catchment descriptors: the slope-area (S-A) relation, curvature-area (C-A) relation, and the cumulative area distribution (CAD), in two semiarid basins in central New Mexico. All three land surface properties were found to have significant influences on the S-A and C-A relations, while the power-law exponents of the CADs for these properties did not show any significant deviations from the narrow range of universal scaling exponents reported in the literature. Among the three different surface properties we investigated, vegetation had the most profound impact on the catchment descriptors. Following data analysis, the role of solar radiation on landscape morphology was investigated in the second part with a numerical model framework that integrated a range of ecohydrologic and geomorphic processes. Modeled spatial patterns of soil moisture confirmed empirical observations at the landscape scale as well as other hydrologic modeling studies. The spatial variability in soil moisture was controlled by aspect prior to the wet season (North American Monsoon, NAM), and by the hydraulic connectivity of the flow network during the NAM. Aspect and network connectivity signatures were also manifested on plant biomass with typically denser vegetation cover on north-facing slopes than south-facing slopes. Over the long-term, CHILD gave slightly steeper and less dissected north-facing slopes, more dissected south-facing slopes, and overall asymmetry in the modeled morphology of valleys. Aspect influence on hillslope asymmetry was enhanced with greater uplift rates. Model simulations showed how subtle differences in biomass and soil moisture dynamics at annual scales lead to distinct geomorphic differences at both hillslope and catchment scales. The controls of latitude and mean annual precipitation (MAP) on the development of hillslope asymmetry were investigated in the third part by using the CHILD LEM. In simulations the mean slope of north-facing slopes was steepened towards the poles, while south-facing slopes became gentler toward the poles. As a result of this inverse pattern, the relative differences between north- verses south-facing slopes become larger toward the poles. The model outcomes, which are compatible with field observations, show north-facing slopes to be steeper (shallower) than south-facing slopes in the northern (southern) hemisphere. Our results underscore the influence of solar radiation as a global control on the development of hillslope asymmetry. Variations in MAP at the same latitude have little impact on hillslope asymmetry in comparison to variations in latitude at the same MAP. In the last part, the observed spatial patterns in erosion rates caused by aspect-driven microclimatic and ecohydrologic conditions are examined with the CHILD LEM forced with a uniform uplift rate obtained by averaging the erosion estimates from the study site. Climate represented in the model ranges from simple to more realistic. The climate forcing is simulated by: (1) stationary climate represents the recent climate that prevails in the study site; (2) cyclic climate represents the late Pleistocene climate that prevailed in the region; (3) paleo-constructed climate based on paleoclimate proxies. Recent field study in central New Mexico shows that long-term erosion rates (~10,000 years) on south-facing slopes are faster than opposing north-facing slopes. However, CHILD simulations show that the discrepancy in erosion rates on opposing hillslopes is not sustainable over the long-term. Depending on the climate forcing or internal dynamics of erosion mechanism, either north- or south-facing slopes can be more erosive than their counterparts. Over the long-term, however, the fluctuations in spatial erosion rates are averaging out. Hence, under a given uniform uplift, erosion rates on opposing hillslopes are found to be the same.

Worldwide, awareness has been raised about the dangers of growing greenhouse gas emissions.  In the United States, transportation is a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. American and European researchers have identified a potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing passenger vehicle travel with delivery service.  These reductions are possible because, while delivery vehicles have higher rates of greenhouse gas emissions than private light-duty vehicles, the routing of delivery vehicles to customers is far more efficient than those customers traveling independently. In addition to lowering travel-associated greenhouse gas emissions, because of their more efficient routing and tendency to occur during off-peak hours, delivery services have the potential to reduce congestion. Thus, replacing passenger vehicle travel with delivery service provides opportunity to address global concerns - greenhouse gas emissions and congestion. While addressing the impact of transportation on greenhouse gas emissions is critical, transportation also produces significant levels of criteria pollutants, which impact the health of those in the immediate area. These impacts are of particular concern in urban areas, which due to their constrained land availability increase proximity of residents to the roadway network.  In the United States, heavy vehicles (those typically used for deliveries) produce a disproportionate amount of NOx and particulate matter - heavy vehicles represent roughly 9% of vehicle miles travelled but produce nearly 50% of the NOx and PM10 from transportation. Researchers have noted that urban policies designed to address local concerns including air quality impacts and noise pollution - like time and size restrictions - have a tendency to increase global impacts, by increasing the number of vehicles on the road, by increasing the total VMT required, or by increasing the amount of CO2 generated. The work presented here is designed to determine whether replacing passenger vehicle travel with delivery service can address both concerns simultaneously. In other words, can replacing passenger travel with delivery service reduce congestion and CO2 emissions as well as selected criteria pollutants? Further, does the design of the delivery service impacts the results? Lastly, how do these impacts differ in rural versus urban land use patterns? This work models the amount of VMT, CO2, NOx, and PM10 generated by personal travel and delivery vehicles in a number of different development patterns and in a number of different scenarios, including various warehouse locations. In all scenarios, VMT is reduced through the use of delivery service, and in all scenarios, NOx and PM10 are lowest when passenger vehicles are used for the last mile of travel. The goods movement scheme that results in the lowest generation of CO2, however, varies by municipality. Regression models for each goods movement scheme and models that compare sets of goods movement schemes were developed. The most influential variables in all models were measures of roadway density and proximity of a service area to the regional warehouse. These results allow for a comparison of the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions in the form of CO2 to local criteria pollutants (NOx and PM10) for each scenario. These efforts will contribute to increased integration of goods movement in urban planning, inform policies designed to mitigate the impacts of goods movement vehicles, and provide insights into achieving sustainability targets, especially as online shopping and goods delivery becomes more prevalent.

This work is motivated by the need to improve data quality and coverage for performance reporting and system management decisions. Missing data, whether due to hardware malfunction or error detection and removal, is a critical concern in loop detector data quality control in Washington State and elsewhere, and can quickly become the controlling factor in overall data quality as the rate of missingness increases. First, the various causal factors and resulting patterns of missingness in loop detector datasets are discussed with respect to the assumptions underlying common missing data treatments. Next, two multiple imputation methodologies are introduced for loop detector data, which have seen use in a number of fields but have not yet been applied to traffic data. These methods are able to take advantage of the various spatial correlation structures present in volume and speed data, and can produce reliable imputation even under high rates of missingness and missing entire days and months. The proposed imputation algorithms are demonstrated in different locations, time periods, and missing data patterns, and are shown to be capable of reliably representing the statistical properties of the true data. Aggregation levels, model structure, and limitations of the proposed methods are discussed, and some guidelines for implementation are presented. The proposed algorithms are designed to be incorporated into a comprehensive quality control process for traffic data, to be implemented as part of the STAR Lab DRIVE Net data analysis, visualization, and dissemination platform.
