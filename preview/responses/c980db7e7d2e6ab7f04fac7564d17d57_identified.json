She died on 2 May 1964. Her first marriage to American Robert Shaw in 1896 was not successful and they divorced in 1903. In 1906 she married Waldorf Astor and they settled at Cliveden, Bucks. When her husband succeeded his father as Viscount Astor in 1919 Nancy took his place as the Conservative MP for Plymouth (Sutton Division), becoming the first woman to sit in the House of Commons. She campaigned in particular for women's causes and for temperance and was known for her sharp wit. </p>       </bioghist>       <scopecontent>          <p> The collection consists of two main groups of Nancy Astor's papers.

Subjects covered include elections and local affairs in Plymouth; children's education and welfare and the creation of nursery schools; Christian Science; health; pensions; protection and support of the family; temperance; tours to Canada and the United States; unemployment; women's suffrage and work during the two world wars. General/Personal correspondence 1900-1964 contains letters from family, friends and eminent people in the UK, Europe, Canada and the United States. Sundry papers include unclassified files relating to Plymouth, non-parliamentary and parliamentary speeches, articles and messages, invitations and royal visits, political diaries and other diaries.
