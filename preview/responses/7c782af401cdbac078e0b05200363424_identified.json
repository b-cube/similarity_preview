In addition to conducting the BHPS and disseminating it to the research community, ISER undertakes a programme of research based on panel data, using the BHPS and other national panels to monitor and measure social change. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The main objective of the BHPS is to further understanding of social and economic change at the individual and household level in the UK, and to identify, model and forecast such changes and their causes and consequences in relation to a range of socio-economic variables. It is conducted as a longitudinal study, where each adult member (aged 16 years and over) of a sampled household is interviewed annually. If individuals leave their original household, all adult members of their new households are interviewed. Children are also interviewed. For full details of the BHPS methodology, sampling, changes over time, and a complete set of documentation, see the main BHPS study, held at the UK Data Archive under SN 5151, and the &lt;a href=\"http://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/survey/bhps/documentation\" title=\"ISER BHPS documentation\"&gt;ISER BHPS documentation&lt;/a&gt; web pages.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;BHPS geographic identifiers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; The BHPS geographic identifier data are consistent with the ONS Postcode Directory (ONSPD). Users are advised to obtain the latest version of ONSPD from the &lt;a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/postcode-directories/-nspp-/index.html\" title=\"National Statistics Postcode Products\"&gt;National Statistics Postcode Products&lt;/a&gt; webpage, where it is downloadable in text (.txt), CSV, Microsoft Access or .dbf formats, or can be ordered on CD/DVD.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Understanding Society:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; From Wave 19, the BHPS has been subsumed into a new longitudinal study called &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt;, or the &lt;i&gt;United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study&lt;/i&gt; (UKHLS), conducted by ISER. The BHPS Wave 19 formed part of &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; Wave 2 (January 2010 - March 2011). The BHPS fieldwork period has therefore moved from September-April to January-March. This means that the gap between interviews 18 and 19 for the BHPS sample ranges between 16 and 30 months rather than the standard 12 months. From Wave 2, the BHPS sample has been a permanent part of the larger study and interviews are conducted annually again. BHPS sample members have an identifier within the &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; datasets, allowing BHPS users to match BHPS Wave 1-18 data to &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; Wave 2 (and onwards) data. &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt; is held at the Archive under SN 6614. Further information is available on the &lt;a href=\"https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/\" title =\"Understanding Society\"&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/a&gt; web site.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>The &lt;i&gt; British Household Panel Survey, Waves 1-18, 1991-2008: 1991 Ward, Census Code Range (WARDC91)&lt;/i&gt; dataset contains the 1991 Electoral Ward (Census code range) geographic variable for each wave of the BHPS to date, and a household identification serial number for file matching to the main BHPS data. These data have more restrictive access conditions than those available under the standard End User Licence (see 'Access' section below). Those users who wish to make an application for these data should contact the HelpDesk for further details.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Understanding Society:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; From Wave 19, the BHPS will be subsumed into a new longitudinal study called &lt;i&gt;Understanding Society&lt;/i&gt;, or the &lt;i&gt;United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study&lt;/i&gt; (UKHLS), conducted by ISER.
