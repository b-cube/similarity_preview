Based on Mie theory calculations, we estimate that such a redistribution can increase the absorption efficiency of internally-mixed BC aerosols by up to 25% compared to the core-shell approximation.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063052\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Revisiting the hemispheric asymmetry in mid-latitude ozone changes following the Mount Pinatubo eruption: A 3-D model study</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063052</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Revisiting the hemispheric asymmetry in mid-latitude ozone changes following the Mount Pinatubo eruption: A 3-D model study</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">S.

Our results suggest that unless H2O weakening of ringwoodite or phase-transformation-induced grain size reduction occurs in the lower MTZ, it will be more viscous than above the 410 km discontinuity.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063361\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>The dayside reconnection voltage applied to Saturn's magnetosphere</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063361</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">The dayside reconnection voltage applied to Saturn's magnetosphere</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">A.

Furthermore, we confirm that the enhancement of tsunami height in shallower oceans shifts the ocean depth supplying maximum amplitudes of tsunami magnetic fields from approximately 2.0 km to 1.5 km.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063075\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Crystallization and immersion freezing ability of oxalic and succinic acid in multi-component aqueous organic aerosol particles</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063075</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Crystallization and immersion freezing ability of oxalic and succinic acid in multi-component aqueous organic aerosol particles</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Robert Wagner, Kristina H\\ufffd\\ufffdhler, Ottmar M\\ufffd\\ufffdhler, Harald Saathoff, Martin Schnaiter</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-03-07T10:12:54.634202-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2015GL063075</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2015GL063075</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063075</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Letter</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">ABSTRACT</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>This study reports on heterogeneous ice nucleation efficiency of immersed oxalic and succinic acid crystals in the temperature range from 245 to 215 K, as investigated with expansion cooling experiments using suspended particles.

The MTZ appears to be unperturbed, despite the proximity of the sampled region to the deep cratonic root.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063239\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>On the Incident Solar Radiation in CMIP5 Models</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063239</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">On the Incident Solar Radiation in CMIP5 Models</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Linjiong Zhou, Minghua Zhang, Qing Bao, Yimin Liu</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-03-05T08:39:02.459615-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2015GL063239</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2015GL063239</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063239</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Letter</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">Abstract</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Annual incident solar radiation at the top of atmosphere (TOA) should be independent of longitudes.

All this supports the vertical collapse hypothesis to explain the origin of the Las Ca\\ufffd\\ufffdadas caldera.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063161\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Pressurized magma reservoir within the east rift zone of K\\ufffd\\ufffdlauea volcano, Hawai\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdi: Evidence for relaxed stress changes from the 1975 Kalapana earthquake</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063161</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Pressurized magma reservoir within the east rift zone of K\\ufffd\\ufffdlauea volcano, Hawai\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdi: Evidence for relaxed stress changes from the 1975 Kalapana earthquake</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Scott Baker, Falk Amelung</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-03-04T08:21:21.794199-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2015GL063161</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2015GL063161</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063161</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Letter</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">n/a</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">Abstract</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>We use 2000-2012 InSAR data from multiple satellites to investigate magma storage in K\\ufffd\\ufffdlauea's East Rift Zone (ERZ).

One case study of a container ship shows that there are higher concentrations of sea salt tracer species behind it relative to adjacent control areas. These results have implications for cloud properties and precipitation in marine boundary layers exposed to ship traffic.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063293\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>2D seismic attenuation images of Stromboli Island using active data</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063293</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2D seismic attenuation images of Stromboli Island using active data</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">J.

We further show that these wave impacts are not well represented in reanalysis data.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062674\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Interannual variability in the Yucatan Channel flow</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062674</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Interannual variability in the Yucatan Channel flow</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Gabriela Athi\\ufffd\\ufffd, Julio Sheinbaum, Robert Leben, Jos\\ufffd\\ufffd Ochoa, Michael R.

Samples locations are separated by only few hundred meters across a 15\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdkm along-axis profile. The data reveal a strong geochemical variability that has never been observed at such high spatial resolution for helium isotope compositions. Moreover, they reveal an unusually high 4He/3He mantle component also characterized by unradiogenic lead, atypical in oceanic basalts. He-Pb systematics suggests a mixture between a nonradiogenic lead and radiogenic helium pyroxenitic component, recycled from the deep continental lithosphere and the ambient peridotitic mantle. The He isotope difference between these two end-members can be interpreted as a time evolution of two distinct mantle sources after a slight (U\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd+\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTh)/3He fractionation, likely due to some ancient degassing during the formation of deep continental pyroxenites.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062806\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Dynamic perennial firn aquifer on an Arctic glacier</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062806</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Dynamic perennial firn aquifer on an Arctic glacier</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Knut Christianson, Jack Kohler, Richard B.

The features exhibit completely separate motion and morphology. From emission ratios and ion chemistry modeling, the average energy and energy flux of the precipitation is estimated. The high-energy precipitation is found to form large pulsating patches of 0.1\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHz with a 3\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHz modulation, and nonpulsating coexisting discrete auroral filaments. The low-energy precipitation is observed simultaneously on the same field line as discrete filaments with no pulsation. The simultaneous structures do not interact, and they drift with different speeds in different directions. We suggest that the high- and low-energy electron populations are accelerated by separate mechanisms, at different distances from Earth. The small-scale structures could be caused by local instabilities above the ionosphere.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063064\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>First artificial periodic inhomogeneity experiments at HAARP</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063064</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">First artificial periodic inhomogeneity experiments at HAARP</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">D.

We assume that anisotropy is the result of plastic deformation within a large-scale flow induced by preferred growth at the inner core equator.

We assume that anisotropy is the result of plastic deformation within a large-scale flow induced by preferred growth at the inner core equator. Based on elastic moduli from the literature, body-centered cubic or face-centered cubic Fe produces seismic anisotropy well below seismic observations (&lt;0.4%). A Monte Carlo approach allows us to generalize this result to any form of elastic anisotropy in a cubic system. Within our model, inner core global anisotropy is not compatible with a cubic structure of Fe alloy. Hence, if the inner core material is indeed cubic, large-scale coherent anisotropic structures, incompatible with plastic deformation induced by large-scale flow, must be present.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063089\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Tracing the strength of the southwest monsoon using boron isotopes in the eastern Arabian Sea</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2015GL063089</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Tracing the strength of the southwest monsoon using boron isotopes in the eastern Arabian Sea</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Sushant S.

While this information is rarely fully available due to the paucity of relevant seismic data, dense arrays like the 5200-geophone array in Long Beach, California provide the opportunity to study this amplitude variability. Here we show that ambient noise correlation amplitudes from the Long Beach array can be used to directly determine frequency-dependent site amplification factors.

While this information is rarely fully available due to the paucity of relevant seismic data, dense arrays like the 5200-geophone array in Long Beach, California provide the opportunity to study this amplitude variability. Here we show that ambient noise correlation amplitudes from the Long Beach array can be used to directly determine frequency-dependent site amplification factors. We analyze Rayleigh-wavefield amplitude gradients from ambient noise correlations that are processed so that relative amplitudes satisfy the wave equation and are therefore meaningful. Ultimately, we construct maps of site amplification across Long Beach at frequencies of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHz.

For gyroresonant heating to be consistent with our observations, an additional mechanism for field-aligned acceleration is required.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062977\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Modeling inward diffusion and slow decay of energetic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062977</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Modeling inward diffusion and slow decay of energetic electrons in the Earth's outer radiation belt</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Q.

Mesoscale eddy kinetic energy and strain rate can be used, to first order, to infer submesoscale vertical velocity, implying a possible route to parameterise submesoscale activity in coarser resolution models.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062611\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Importance and origin of halosteric contribution to sea level change in the southeast Indian Ocean during 2005\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2013</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062611</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Importance and origin of halosteric contribution to sea level change in the southeast Indian Ocean during 2005\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2013</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">William Llovel, Tong Lee</dc:creator><dc:date xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">2015-02-26T10:26:01.430035-05:00</dc:date><dc:identifier xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">doi:10.1002/2014GL062611</dc:identifier><dc:rights xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"/><dc:publisher xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</dc:publisher><prism:doi xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">10.1002/2014GL062611</prism:doi><prism:url xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062611</prism:url><prism:section xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">Research Letter</prism:section><prism:startingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">1148</prism:startingPage><prism:endingPage xmlns:prism=\"http://prismstandard.org/namespaces/1.2/basic/\">1157</prism:endingPage><content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[ <h3 xhtml=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:ol=\"http://www.wiley.com/namespaces/ol/xsl-lib\">Abstract</h3> <div class=\"para\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Steric sea level change has been identified as one of the major contributors to the regional variability of sea level trends observed by satellite altimetry for the past two decades.

It is noted that more extreme changes in proxy variance are required to robustly infer decreases, as opposed to increases, in past ENSO amplitude from modern levels.</description></item><item rdf:about=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062669\" xmlns=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/\"><title>Earth's energy imbalance since 1960 in observations and CMIP5 models</title><link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2F2014GL062669</link><dc:title xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Earth's energy imbalance since 1960 in observations and CMIP5 models</dc:title><dc:creator xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">Doug M.
