This article considers first Fanon's unpublished medical thesis, which contains a remarkably lucid discussion of the relationship of neurology and psychiatry: Fanon takes a position in the main debates of the time (in particular those opposing Ey and Lacan) which proves crucial for an understanding of his later work on alienation. This article then considers Fanon's published papers on his experiments with neuropsychiatric treatment in St Alban and in Blida, showing how he moved towards a sociotherapeutical approach, which in turn led him to consider the essential role of culture in mental illness. This article ends by examining Fanon's creation, in Tunis, of an institution of psychiatric care outside of the asylum, which he saw as a blueprint for mental health care in the future. This is the accepted manuscript of a paper published in Nottingham French Studies 2015, 54(1), 52-71. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-17T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246454\"> <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: Love and unknowing in Alina Marazzi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Un\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOra sola ti vorrei [For One More Hour with You] (2002)</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246454</link> <description>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdHer hair over her arms and her arms full of flowers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: Love and unknowing in Alina Marazzi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Un\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOra sola ti vorrei [For One More Hour with You] (2002) Wilson, Emma In her first documentary film, For One More Hour With You (2002), Alina Marazzi explores ways of using cinema, and in particular carefully edited found footage, to attend to sensory presence, to girlhood, to female sexuality, to sensuality and love. Marazzi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work is sensitive to ways in which cinema may conjure another individual as sensate and animate, as affectively and erotically present, as touched, elated and damaged. Yet her work is also finely attuned to protection and to ethical delicacy, forging a responsive sensibility, reminding us of all that we also don\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt know of each other. Her focus on her mother Liseli Hoepli Marazzi, on her loves, on the moves from girlhood into more charged erotic and affective experience, is part of a broader feminist agenda. Marazzi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work encourages viewers to feel, to attend to sensation, whilst remaining uncertain of what is seen or heard. This is the accepted manuscript. It's currently embargoed pending publication of the final version by Edinburgh University Press (http://www.euppublishing.com/journal/para). </description> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246395\"> <title>Screen Animals</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246395</link> <description>Screen Animals McMahon, Laura This is the accepted manuscript.
