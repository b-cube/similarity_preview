An             orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature             displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief,             sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control             points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each             pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital             orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image.             The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near             infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the             resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel.</abstract>          <purpose>A digital orthoimage is a geometrically accurate photographic record of landscape             conditions at the time of the corresponding aerial photography. As such, High Resolution             Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring,             facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The             digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector             line mapping. The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency             responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative             routes and safe access to aid. High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement             personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in             high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions. The data assists Federal, State and             local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts. This data also             supports The National Map.</purpose>          <supplinf>The data obtained through The National Map is considered to be the \"best             available\" data from USGS. Information in quotation marks, initial processing steps,             accuracy reports, and source information is taken directly from the original             metadata.</supplinf>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>2001</begdate>                <enddate>Present</enddate>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current>ground condition</current>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>Complete</progress>          <update>Irregular</update>       </status>       <spdom>          <bounding>             <westbc>-180.0</westbc>             <eastbc>-56.0</eastbc>             <northbc>72.0</northbc>             <southbc>-17.0</southbc>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>NGDA Portfolio Themes</themekt>             <themekey>National Geospatial Data Asset</themekey>             <themekey>NGDA</themekey>             <themekey>Imagery Theme</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>ISO 19115 Category</themekt>             <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>          </theme>          <theme>             <themekt>None</themekt>             <themekey>digital spatial data</themekey>             <themekey>Georeferenced</themekey>             <themekey>rectified image</themekey>             <themekey>orthophoto</themekey>             <themekey>Aerial Photography</themekey>             <themekey>orthoimage</themekey>             <themekey>image map</themekey>             <themekey>High Resolution Orthoimagery</themekey>             <themekey>natural color orthophoto</themekey>             <themekey>a-16</themekey>             <themekey>wwhgd</themekey>          </theme>          <place>             <placekt>GNIS</placekt>             <placekey>United States</placekey>             <placekey>U.S.</placekey>             <placekey>US</placekey>             <placekey>Mexico</placekey>             <placekey>Puerto Rico</placekey>             <placekey>Virgin Islands</placekey>             <placekey>Canada</placekey>             <placekey>Guam</placekey>             <placekey>Palau</placekey>             <placekey>Micronesia</placekey>             <placekey>Marshall Islands</placekey>             <placekey>American Samoa</placekey>             <placekey>Mariana Islands</placekey>             <placekey>Trusts</placekey>          </place>          <place>             <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special                sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information                Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and                Technology</placekt>             <placekey>United States</placekey>             <placekey>U.S.</placekey>             <placekey>US</placekey>          </place>       </keywords>       <accconst>Any downloading and use of these data signifies a user's agreement to comprehension          and compliance of the USGS Standard Disclaimer.

Slight             systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these             are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along             flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or             darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages.
