Interfacial tension (IFT), fundamentally defines liquid interactions at the micro-scale. To give some perspective of the importance of understanding this tension, gravity hardly plays a role given the tiny masses of micro particles when compared to the role that surface tension plays. Most of the current studies on IFT rely on some application of the differential Young-Laplace equation, which expresses the equilibrium condition across an interface. The application of the Young-Laplace equation goes as far as to state the fundamental set of differential equations that define the forces and geometries of the traditional pendant drop, however, it uses an approximate shape parameter that is taken from empirical data. Using the power of modern computing power, the research will analyze the second order partial differential Young-Laplace Equation in its association with the interfacial tension between different interfaces using a computer program written in MATLAB. The differential Laplace Equation will be applied in conjunction with image processing and other data processing methods to develop a real time user-friendly IFT calculator that takes in an image of a liquid immersed in another liquid and outputs a value of the interfacial tension between the two immiscible fluids all in real time. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Mohan, Kevin K</dc:creator> <dc:description>In the field of soft condensed matter and in particular, microfluidics, the understanding of surface tension is vital.

Our hierarchical Task Execution Model, called TEM, is a tree, where each leaf represents an action and each node represents a composite action (or subtask). We distinguish three types of composite nodes (s-group: sequential, r-group: reversible, and u-group: unordered). Although the sub-task children of a node must always be executed as a contiguous (uninterrupted) sequence, the valid orders for that sequence depend on the node type. Hence, a TEM captures a well-defined set of contiguity and ordering constraints. &#13; &#13; TEM may be used to test quickly whether a candidate plan of actions is compatible with the task model and also to provide a list of valid actions at any step during the lazy execution of a task. We propose an incremental algorithm that takes as input the current TEM learned from previous demonstrations and a new demonstration in order to produce a new TEM. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Rossignac-Milon, Leo Thomas</dc:creator> <dc:description>We propose an incremental approach for learning a hierarchical task model from a series of demonstrations, where each demonstration is a permutation of a fixed number of different actions.
