The coastal Bay of Bengal is characterised by relatively fresher, more basic and lower pCO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; in 1991 compared to 2011. The rates of decrease in pH, increase in DIC and pCO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; per decade were consistent with global trends in the southwestern (SW) coastal Bay of Bengal, whereas rates in the northwestern (NW) coastal Bay of Bengal were observed to be 3\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd5 times higher. The associated recent increase in sulphate and nitrogen aerosol loadings over NW Bay of Bengal from the Indo-Gangetic Plain and Southeast Asia during winter and spring may be mainly responsible for the increased acidity in recent years. Thus, this region, which was previously considered to be a significant sink for atmospheric CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt;, now seems to have become a source of CO&lt;SUB&gt;2&lt;/SUB&gt; to the atmosphere</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4716\">     <title>Distribution and sources of aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids in surface sediments of a tropical estuary south west coast of India (Cochin estuary)</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4716</link>     <description>Title: Distribution and sources of aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids in surface sediments of a tropical estuary south west coast of India (Cochin estuary) &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Gireeshkumar, T.R.; Deepulal, P.M.; Chandramohanakumar, N. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: Surface sediments samples from the Cochin estuary were measured for elemental, stable isotopic and molecular biomarkers (aliphatic hydrocarbons and fatty acids) to study the sources and distribution of sedimentary organic matter. Concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN) and stable isotopic ratios of carbon (delta &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) ranged from 0.62 to 2.74 %, 0.09 to 0.25 % and -27.5 to 21.7\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, respectively. Sedimentary n-alkanes ranged from 6.03 to 43.23 mu g g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; with an average of 16.79 mu g g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, while total fatty acids varied from 22.55 to 440.69 mu g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The TOC/TN ratios and delta &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C suggest a mixture of marine- and terrestrial-derived organic matter in the surface sediments with increasing contributions from marine-derived organic matter towards the seaward side. Long-chain n-alkanes derived from higher plants predominated the inner part of the estuary, while short-chain n-alkanes derived from planktonic sources predominated the bar mouth region. The even carbon preference of the C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdC&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; n-alkanes may refer to the direct biogenic contribution from bacteria, fungi and yeast species and to the potential direct petroleum inputs. The presence of odd mid-chain n-alkanes in the sediments indicates the organic matter inputs from submerged and floating macrophytes (water hyacinth). Various molecular indices such as carbon preference index, terrestrial to aquatic ratio, average chain length and the ratios of mid-chain n-alkanes support the aforementioned inferences. The high contribution of odd and branched chain fatty acids along with very low contribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids, suggest the effective utilisation of algae-derived organic matter by bacteria and the effective recycling of labile organic matter in whole settling and deposition processes. The distributional variability of n-alkanes and fatty acids reveals the preferential utilisation of marine-derived organic matter and the selective preservation of terrestrial-derived organic matter in surface sediments of the Cochin estuary</description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4715\">     <title>Depositional record of trace metals and degree of contamination in core sediments from the Mandovi estuarine mangrove ecosystem, west coast of India</title>     <link>http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/4715</link>     <description>Title: Depositional record of trace metals and degree of contamination in core sediments from the Mandovi estuarine mangrove ecosystem, west coast of India &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Authors: Veerasingam, S.; Vethamony, P.; ManiMurali, R.; Fernandes, B. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Abstract: The concentrations of seven trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Co, Pb and Zn) in three sediment cores were analysed to assess the depositional trends of metals and their contamination level in the Mandovi estuary, west coast of India. All sediment cores showed enrichment of trace metals in the upper part of core sediments and decrease in concentration with depth, suggesting excess of anthropogenic loading (including mining activities) occurred during the recent past. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images distinguished the shape, size and structure of particles derived from lithogenic and anthropogenic sources in core sediments. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) values indicate that Mandovi estuary is \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmoderately polluted\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd with Pb, whereas \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdunpolluted to moderately polluted\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd with Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Co and Zn.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain VBW088&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; was clustered with three type strains of Vitellibacter species and exhibited sequence similarity of 97.3 % with Vitellibacter soesokkakensis RSSK-12&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;. However, strain VBW088&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; and V. soesokkakensis RSSK-12&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; showed a low DNA-DNA relatedness (12.7\\ufffd\\ufffd3.5 %). Strain VBW088T was positive for catalase and oxidase. Growth occurred at 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd37 \\ufffd\\ufffdC with optimum at 30 \\ufffd\\ufffdC, at pH 6.0\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd8.0 (optimum 6.0) and with up to 5 % of NaCl concentration (w/v) with optimum at 1\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2 % NaCl. The major fatty acids (&gt;10 %) were iso-C15:0 (33.5 %) and iso-C17:0 3-OH (32.0 %). The polar lipids detected in strain VBW088T consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), one unidentified aminolipid and three unidentified phospholipids. The DNA G+C content of strain VBW088T was 36.7 mol%. On the basis of phylogenetic inference, DNA-DNA relatedness, chemotaxonomic analysis and physiological data, the isolate represents a novel species of the genus Vitellibacter, for which the name Vitellibacter nionensis sp. nov., is proposed, with type strain VBW088T (=KCTC 32420T = MCC 2354T)</description>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
