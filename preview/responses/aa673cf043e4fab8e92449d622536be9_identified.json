A bequest through your will or revocable trust:</p> <ul> <li>is easy to arrange.</li> <li>will not alter your current lifestyle in any way.</li> <li>can be easily modified to address your changing needs.</li> </ul> <h3>Residual Gift Language<a href=\"http://www.witf.org/support/sample-codicil.doc\"><br /></a></h3> <p>A residual bequest comes to <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;after your estate expenses and specific bequests are paid:</p> <blockquote>I give and devise to witf, Inc., located in Harrisburg, PA, all (<em>or</em>&nbsp;you can state a percentage) of the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, both real and personal, to be used for its general support (<em>or</em> for the support of a specific <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;fund or program).</blockquote> <h3>Specific Gift Language</h3> <p>Naming <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;as a beneficiary of a specific amount from your estate is easy:</p> <blockquote>I give and devise to witf, Inc., located in Harrisburg, PA, the sum of $___________ (or you can list an asset) to be used for its general support (<em>or</em> for the support of a specific <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;fund or program).</blockquote> <h3>Contingent Gift Language</h3> <p><strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;or its affiliates can be named as a contingent beneficiary in your will or personal trust if one or more of your specific bequests cannot be fulfilled:</p> <blockquote>If (insert name) is not living at the time of my demise, I give and devise to witf, Inc., located in Harrisburg, PA, the sum of $ _______ (<em>or </em>all or a percentage of the residue of my estate) to be used for its general support (<em>or</em> for the support of a specific <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;fund or program).</blockquote> <h3>Retirement Plan Beneficiary Language</h3> <p>You may name <strong>witf</strong> as a beneficiary of your Individual Retirement Account&nbsp;(IRA) or other qualified retirement benefits. Donors should consult with their tax advisor regarding the tax benefits of such gifts.</p> <p>Naming <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;as the beneficiary of a qualified retirement plan asset such as a 401(k), 403(b), IRA, Keogh or profit-sharing pension plan will accomplish a charitable goal while helping you to benefit from significant tax savings. &nbsp;Passing such assets on to heirs&nbsp;can be costly because of heavy tax consequences. By naming <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;as a beneficiary of a retirement plan, the donor maintains complete control over the asset while living, but at the donor's death the plan passes to support <strong>witf</strong> free of both estate and income taxes.</p> <p>Making a charitable gift from your retirement plan is easy and should not cost you any attorney fees. Simply request a change-of-beneficiary form from your plan administrator. When you have completed the form, please return it to your plan administrator and notify <strong>witf</strong>. If you need, we can assist you with the proper language for your beneficiary designation to <strong>witf</strong>&nbsp;.</p> <h3>Customized Language</h3> <p>If you or your attorney would like <strong>witf</strong> to provide you with customized beneficiary language that is specific to your goal and interest, please contact:</p> <p><span>Kevin Ditzler, witf Major Gifts Officer&nbsp;</span><br /><span>(717) 910-2954&nbsp;</span><br /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"mailto:kevin_ditzler@witf.org\">kevin_ditzler@witf.org</a>.</p> <p>Need a codicil? <a href=\"http://www.witf.org/support/sample-codicil.doc\" target=\"_blank\">Please click here to download.</a></p>]]>              </content> </entry>  </feed> ",
