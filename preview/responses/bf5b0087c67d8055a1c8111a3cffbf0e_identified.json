Originally, DSpace was designed to be \"digital shelf space\" for the volumes of intellectual output from MIT that are in digital rather than paper form, for example datasets and rich media, in addition to text. This goal was clearly not limited to MIT: universities, research institutions and many other kinds of organisation face the same challenges. Not only does this mean that DSpace could be of value to those organisations: these organisations represent a vast pool of resources, and who might not be able to build such a system from scratch by themselves, but would certainly be able to contribute to the maintenance and enhancement of an existing system. Thus, the vision for DSpace was born: Build a \"breadth-first\" system to tackle the problems in a relatively simple way; then release the system as open source, allowing the globally dispersed community of researchers and developers to add depth, giving the system longevity and growth not possible from one institution working alone. This vision appears to have been well-founded. DSpace is now used by around 100 organisations in 28 countries worldwide, with around 40 individuals having contributed to development. New developments are contributed on a weekly basis, and numerous research projects with forward-looking goals are growing around the DSpace nucleus. DSpace has made the transition to a vibrant open source project, its future and growth assured by the size of our community. In this talk I will give a brief history of DSpace, and give a snapshot of our community today. I'll then describe some of the opportunities and challenges faced by our community moving forward. </summary> <dc:date>2005-07-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Cambridge Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies (CARET): Collaboration, Coherence and Capacity-Building: Using DSpace to Support a Major Social Science Research Programme in the UK.</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/213743\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Procter, Richard</name> </author> <author> <name>Carmichael, P</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/213743</id> <updated>2013-07-25T12:57:11Z</updated> <published>2005-07-07T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Cambridge Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies (CARET): Collaboration, Coherence and Capacity-Building: Using DSpace to Support a Major Social Science Research Programme in the UK. Procter, Richard; Carmichael, P In this paper we describe how the Teaching and Learning Research Programme (TLRP), an eight-year, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd30 million programme charged with supporting and developing educational research in the United Kingdom has implemented and applied a DSpace as a repository for project and programme outputs including published articles, conference papers, research reports, briefings and press releases. The DSpace repository has become a major element in the user engagement strategy of the programme; the OAI (Open Archive Initiative) interface providing a basis for the development of a number of applications and services to projects and other interested groups, including search interfaces, dynamic web content, RSS feeds and other services. These have also formed the basis of collaboration and communication between the TLRP and other research programmes, indexes and resources. The TLRP is also concerned to enable collaboration between researchers and to foster individual, institutional and sector-wide research capacity. The OAI interface has been used as the basis of data visualization tools, allowing the identification of distinctive patterns of collaboration across the diverse projects of the programme, and also allows exploration of similarities and differences between education research (within and beyond the TLRP) and other disciplines. </summary> <dc:date>2005-07-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
