As part of an international team of scientists, Dr Tony Freeth has been a central part of research on the Antikythera Mechanism over the last fifteen years. It has been an extraordinary journey of discovery, which has led to a revolution in our understanding of the device. It is a landmark in the history of science and technology and one of the true wonders of the ancient world.</rss:description>              <dc:creator>Sarah Davenport</dc:creator>              <dc:date>2015-02-13T11:03:50Z</dc:date>       <silvanews:location>G31, Foster Court, UCL</silvanews:location>       <silvanews:start_datetime>2015-03-25T17:30:00Z</silvanews:start_datetime>                   </rss:item>           <rss:item rdf:about=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/events/archive/Reassembling-the-Republic-of-Letters\">       <rss:title>Networking to the fourth power: Reassembling the Republic of Letters, 1500-1800</rss:title>       <rss:link>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/events/archive/Reassembling-the-Republic-of-Letters</rss:link>       <rss:description>          Between 1500 and 1800, the development of increasingly affordable, reliable, and accessible postal systems allowed scholars to scatter correspondence across and beyond Europe.\\ufffd\\ufffd This epistolary exchange knit together the self-styled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrepublic of letters\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, an international, knowledge-based civil society central to that era\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds intellectual breakthroughs and formative for many of modern Europe\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds values and institutions. Despite its importance, the republic of letters remains poorly integrated into early modern European intellectual history, and this primarily for one simple reason: its core practice of creating communities by dispersing archives of manuscripts has posed insuperable difficulties to subsequent generations of historians attempting to reconstruct the very documents which established this community.\\ufffd\\ufffd The ongoing revolution in digital communication provides, for the first time, an adequate medium for reassembling the material dispersed by the earlier revolution in postal communication; but before this potential can be realized we need, not merely to adapt the technology to the task, but also to adapt our working methods and scholarly cultures to the technology. More specifically, we need (1) to create an interdisciplinary network of archivists, librarians, IT systems developers, experts in communication and design, educationalists, and scholars from many different fields (2) to design the networking infrastructure and scholarly practices needed (3) to support an international scholarly community devoted (4) to piecing back together the scattered documentation of the international republic of letters.\\ufffd\\ufffd In other words, we need a network to design a network to support a network reconstructing networks: networking to the fourth power.\\ufffd\\ufffd</rss:description>              <dc:creator>Sarah Davenport</dc:creator>              <dc:date>2015-03-02T15:21:50Z</dc:date>       <silvanews:location>G31, Foster Court</silvanews:location>       <silvanews:start_datetime>2015-05-06T16:30:00Z</silvanews:start_datetime>                   </rss:item>           <rss:item rdf:about=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/events/archive/urban-spaces-via-GPS\">       <rss:title>Embodiments, Subjectivities and Reconfigurations of Urban Spaces via GPS Mobile Applications: Driving/Guiding</rss:title>       <rss:link>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/events/archive/urban-spaces-via-GPS</rss:link>       <rss:description>                  In his research,  Regner Ramos  explores the relationship between bodies, urban space and mobile technologies by studying the affectional and spatial properties of three GPS-based mobile applications\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdGrindr, Mappiness and Waze.
