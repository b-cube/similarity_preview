As of June 2013, single descriptions can be downloaded from the MOL Online Public Access Catalogue (OPAC) as TEI XML documents by any user. The aim of the first tool is to supply manuscript descriptions to the institutions which produced them using MOL, because libraries and research organizations need to use their own data, outside the MOL project. The aim of the second service \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd exporting manuscript catalogues of entire collections as TEI XML files - is to promote exchange of data with other national and international projects. For these purposes, the ICCU needs a rich schema, not only a partial set of metadata, in order to be able to export complete structured manuscript descriptions.

The different needs of scholars, coupled with the constant search for an effective price/result ratio and the local availability of technical skills, have led to a remarkable fragmentation: publishing solutions range from simple HTML pages produced using the TEI stylesheets (or the TEI Boilerplate software) to very complex frameworks based on CMS and SQL search engines. Researchers of the Digital Vercelli Book project started looking into a simple, user-friendly solution and eventually decided to build their own: EVT (Edition Visualization Technology) has been under development since about 2010 and has turned into a flexible tool that can be used to create a web-based digital ...</p>]]></description>      <dc:creator>Roberto Rosselli Del Turco</dc:creator>      <dc:creator>Giancarlo Buomprisco</dc:creator>      <dc:creator>Chiara Di Pietro</dc:creator>      <dc:creator>Julia Kenny</dc:creator>      <dc:creator>Raffaele Masotti</dc:creator>      <dc:creator>Jacopo Pugliese</dc:creator>     <link>http://jtei.revues.org/1077</link>     <dc:date>2014-12-28</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://jtei.revues.org/979\">     <title>Towards an Interoperable Digital Scholarly Edition</title>     <description><![CDATA[       <p class=\"resume\">Recent proposals for creating digital scholarly editions (DSEs) through the crowdsourcing of transcriptions and collaborative scholarship, for the establishment of national repositories of digital humanities data, and for the referencing, sharing, and storage of DSEs, have underlined the need for greater data interoperability. The TEI Guidelines have tried to establish standards for encoding transcriptions since 1988. However, because the choice of tags is guided by human interpretation, TEI-XML encoded files are in general not interoperable. One way to fix this problem may be to break down the current all-in-one approach to encoding so that DSEs can be specified instead by a bundle of separate resources that together offer greater interoperability: plain text versions, markup, annotations, and metadata. This would facilitate not only the development of more general software for handling DSEs, but also enable existing programs that already handle these kinds of data to function more...</p>]]></description>      <dc:creator>Desmond Schmidt</dc:creator>     <link>http://jtei.revues.org/979</link>     <dc:date>2014-11-15</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://jtei.revues.org/974\">     <title>A Design Methodology for Exploring and Communicating System Values and Assumptions         </title>     <description><![CDATA[       <p class=\"resume\">This paper attempts to make two contributions to discussions related to TEI: <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\">(1)</span> an analysis of how tools used for working with TEI documents encourage certain values and make certain assumptions about the work of textual editing and <span style=\"font-weight:normal;\">(2)</span> a report on a methodological framework from outside the humanities that suggests a unique way to study such systems.

It reflects on and analyzes these resources and their audience through the results of a survey intended to inform future support from the TEI Consortium for novice users. Increasing numbers of students look online for self-directed and task-based tutorials, and increasing numbers of scholars in the humanities recognize the TEI Guidelines as a standard tool for publication and analysis. In this context, the author designed the survey presented in this paper to solicit qualitative feedback from both experienced and aspiring practitioners in the field concerning their skills, needs, and goals, pedagogical as well as technical.

Our rationale for focusing on the role of the TEI Consortium in the discussion of evaluation is twofold. First, the TEI Guidelines represents an encoding standard for texts that is supported by a large community actively interested in the application and development of these standards. Second, feedback concerning evaluation criteria for digital scholarship has not been explicitly gathered from the TEI community and may provide additional understanding of the value, process, and assessment of text encoding. Determining what to evaluate and how to do so reveals the community\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds definitions of scholarship in general. The clarification and articulation of evaluation criteria, therefore, remains a high priority as digital scholarship continues to develop.</p>]]></description>      <dc:creator>Sarah L.

Two areas relevant to standardisation are identified and discussed: first, the macro structure of transcriptions, as embodied in the data models and file formats of transcription tools such as ELAN, Praat or EXMARaLDA; second, the micro structure of transcriptions as embodied in transcription conventions such as CA, HIAT or GAT. A two-step process is described in which first the macro structure is represented in a generic TEI format based on elements defined in the P5 version of the Guidelines. In the second step, character data in this representation is parsed according to the regularities of a transcription convention resulting in a more fine-grained TEI markup which is also based on P5. It is argued that this two step process can, on the one hand, map idiosyncratic differenc...</span></p>]]></description>      <dc:creator>Thomas Schmidt</dc:creator>     <link>http://jtei.revues.org/142</link>     <dc:date>2014-02-17</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://jtei.revues.org/233\">     <title>Guest Editors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Note</title>     <description><![CDATA[       <p class=\"texte\">With this inaugural issue of the <em>Journal of the Text Encoding Initiative</em>, we are happy to present selected papers from <em>TEI Conference and Members\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Meetings</em> held in 2008 and 2009. </p>       <p class=\"texte\">In 2007, the TEI Consortium expanded its members\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd meetings to a full conference format.

It was a natural outgrowth of the expansion of the yearly members meeting into a conference format (beginning in 2007 with the University of Maryland meeting) that regularly attracts over 100 participants. It was felt by the TEI Board that a dedicated journal would be the ideal vehicle to build on the success of the conference as well as to capture the diverse scholarly interests of an ever more vibrant TEI user community. The following year, at the London meeting, a committee (consisting of myself, Gabriel Bodard, Lou Burnard, Julianne Nyhan, and Laurent Romary) was formed to explore the best way to achieve this goal. At the 2009 meeting in Ann Arbor, a full proposal was presented to the Board.
