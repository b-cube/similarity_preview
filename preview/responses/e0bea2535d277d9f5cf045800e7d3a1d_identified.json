Although morphologically very similar, these sibling species have different life cycles and roles in the Arctic pelagic marine ecosystem. Considering that the distribution of &lt;em&gt;C. glacialis&lt;/em&gt; corresponds to Arctic water masses and &lt;em&gt;C. finmarchicus&lt;/em&gt; to Atlantic water masses, the species are frequently used as climate indicators. Consequently, correct identification of the two species is essential if we want to understand climate-impacted changes on &lt;em&gt;Calanus&lt;/em&gt;-dominated marine ecosystems such as the Arctic. Here, we present a novel morphological character (redness) to distinguish live females of &lt;em&gt;C. glacialis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C. finmarchicus&lt;/em&gt; and compare it to morphological (prosome length) and genetic identification. The characters are tested on 300 live females of &lt;em&gt;C. glacialis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C. finmarchicus&lt;/em&gt; from Disko Bay, western Greenland. Our analysis confirms that length cannot be used as a stand-alone criterion for separation. The results based on the new morphological character were verified genetically using a single mitochondrial marker (16S) and nuclear loci (six microsatellites and 12 InDels). The pigmentation criterion was also used on individuals (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;89) from Young Sound fjord, northeast Greenland to determine whether the technique was viable in different geographical locations. Genetic markers based on mitochondrial and nuclear loci were corroborative in their identification of individuals and revealed no hybrids. Molecular identification confirmed that live females of the two species from Greenlandic waters, both East and West, can easily be separated by the red pigmentation of the antenna and somites of &lt;em&gt;C. glacialis&lt;/em&gt; in contrast to the pale opaque antenna and somites of &lt;em&gt;C. finmarchicus&lt;/em&gt;, confirming that the pigmentation criterion is valid for separation of the two species.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>     </record>      </records> </xml>",
