This speech was written by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> on behalf of <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name>, a former slave, who is being sued by his adopted son, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>.  The occasion of the speech is <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name>&#8217;s special plea in bar of action (<foreign lang=\"grc\">paragrafh/</foreign>), in other words, a plea that the case not be tried before a jury (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.2\">Dem. 36.2</bibl>, also, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 45\" n=\"Dem. 45.5\">Dem. 45.5</bibl>; for pleas barring action, see <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>).  This was in response to <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>&#8217; attempt to bring <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> to trial to extract 20 talents (see also <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Money\">Money</xref>) that he claims that <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> has fraudulently withheld from him.  The history of the case can be traced back almost 20 years prior to this trial, from the death of <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>, the former owner of <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name>.  <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name> had placed great trust in <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name>, placing him in charge of his banking operations and his shield factory.  <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>&#8217;s will provided for <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> to marry <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>&#8217;s widow, to assume guardianship of <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>&#8217;s ten-year-old son, <name type=\"person\">Pasicles</name>, and to retain control of the shield factory and bank until <name type=\"person\">Pasicles</name> came of age.  But the interests of the young son were threatened by the actions of <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>&#8217;s elder son, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>, who continually dipped into the common funds that <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name> had left his family (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.8\">Dem. 36.8</bibl>).  Because the inheritance of the younger son was endangered, <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> elected to distribute all of the property evenly.  When <name type=\"person\">Pasicles</name> came of age, the bank was given over to <name type=\"person\">Pasicles</name> and the shield factory to <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>, thus releasing <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> of any further obligation.  This, however, did not satisfy <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>, who later took an opportunity to sue <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> for three thousand drachmas which he claimed that <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> had withheld out of <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>&#8217;s property.  This matter was referred to arbitration and the sum was paid by <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> who was granted a new release from all obligations relating to the estate of <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.14\">Dem. 36.14-15</bibl>).  Now, twenty years later, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> is demanding more money from <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name>, in the sum of twenty talents worth of banking stock which he claims that <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> fraudulently withheld (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.4\">Dem. 36.4-7</bibl> and <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.11\">Dem. 36.11-13</bibl>).  <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> entered a special plea in bar of action which is the subject of this particular case.  His speech gives three reasons for doing so.  First, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> is inordinately greedy and an uncontrolled spendthrift (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.41\">Dem. 36.41</bibl>).  Second, <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> appeals to the fact that <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> had released him from all obligations.  And, third, since twenty years had passed, the statute of limitations had expired (<foreign lang=\"grc\">to\\  th=s proqesmi/as no/mon</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.26\">Dem. 36.26</bibl>).  We learn from <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 45\" n=\"Dem. 45.6\">Dem. 45.6</bibl> that <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> won this special plea overwhelmingly, with <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> not even receiving one-fifth of the votes of the jury, and thus having to pay a fine for bringing a frivolous suit (<foreign lang=\"grc\">th\\  e)pwbeli/an</foreign>; see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 45\" n=\"Dem. 45.6\">Dem. 45.6</bibl>).  <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name> died in <date value=\"-370\">370 BCE</date> (source for date:  <bibl n=\"OCD3\"><title>OCD</title><edition>3</edition></bibl>) and references in this speech (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.19\">Dem. 36.19</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.26\">Dem. 36.26</bibl>, and <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 36\" n=\"Dem. 36.38\">Dem. 36.38</bibl>) allow it to be dated to about twenty years after the death of <name type=\"person\">Pasion</name>, to about <date value=\"-350\">350 BCE</date> (source for date:  <bibl>A.T. Murray, <title>Demosthenes IV</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1946] 321</bibl>). The feud between <name type=\"person\">Phormio</name> and <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> was carried on in another lawsuit; see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 45\" n=\"Dem. 45\">Dem. 45</bibl>.</p> <byline>Christopher Cotten</byline> </div0>    </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
