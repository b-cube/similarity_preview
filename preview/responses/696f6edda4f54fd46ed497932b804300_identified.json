There are suggestions for hotel accommodation below. If colleagues require parking, can you please let me know so I can organise visitor permits? I will send round the confirmed agenda and timings shortly, along with instructions for where and when to report. Look forward to welcoming you on Monday 10 November at the University of Derby! Hotel Accommodation Regarding accommodation, we would recommend the Hallmark Hotel, because it\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds right next to Derby train station: http://www.hallmarkhotels.co.uk/our_hotels/derby/ .
