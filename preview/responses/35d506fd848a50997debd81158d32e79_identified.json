932-18.\\ufffd\\ufffd Possibly we did \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; not get a header at beginning of tape.\\ufffd\\ufffd Had difficulty getting flowmeter pin out of flowmeter.\\ufffd\\ufffd We had to \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; bring it back up to get the pin out.\\ufffd\\ufffd In so doing, we got a spurious NR.\\ufffd\\ufffd Printer paper advance \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; malfunctioned for short time during Net 0.\\ufffd\\ufffd On this tow, because I forgot to put header on tape, we decided \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; to SW15 EN at bottom of tow while net 0 still open and then begin a new file with a header before opening \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; net 1 for start up.\\ufffd\\ufffd Thus far, MOCNESS 37 there are two files on the tape: one without a header for down \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt;

OK.\\ufffd\\ufffd Good \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br /&gt; tow except for dropouts on CTP.\\ufffd\\ufffd One thing about samples to look at is very low biomass in net 5.\\ufffd\\ufffd \\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;br
