The TEI maintains a listing of these materials and welcomes additions.</p>             </div>             <div>           <head><ref target=\"../../release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/SG.html\">A Gentle Introduction to XML</ref></head>           <p>The <title>Gentle Introduction</title> is one of the most often cited sections of the TEI Guidelines and has proven its usefulness as an introduction to the essentials of XML markup. It defines and describes elements, attributes, entities, validity, well-formedness, schemas and DTDs. While it is necessarily somewhat technical in nature, it is written for a non-specialist audience and provides an essential background for understanding how encoding languages like the TEI work.</p>          </div>          <div>           <head><ref target=\"odds.xml\">Getting Started with P5 ODDs</ref></head>           <p>The underlying expression of the TEI Guidelines is a document called an <soCalled>ODD</soCalled> (or <q>One Document Does it all</q>), so called because it constitutes a single source from which the P5 schemas, reference documentation, and Guidelines prose are derived. The ODD language (which is part of the TEI language itself) is also the language in which TEI customizations are written. This introduction to the ODD language provides an overview of the essential concepts and some detail on how to write TEI customizations in ODD. ODD customizations may also be created using the web-based <ref target=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/\">Roma</ref> tool.</p>          </div>          <div>           <head><ref target=\"tei_bibliography.xml\">Bibliography</ref></head>           <p>This bibliography of publications relating to the TEI provides further reading on the background, context, theory, and practice of TEI encoding.</p>          </div>         </body>              </text> </TEI>",
