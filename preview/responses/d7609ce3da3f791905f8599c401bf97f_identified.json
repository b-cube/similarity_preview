The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 508 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths for 7 different feature categories within 45 different land class types, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-10-16T08:05:33Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7a5cfd3e-0247-4228-873d-5be563c4ee3b\">     <title>Post Chernobyl surveys of radiocaesium in soil, vegetation, wildlife and fungi in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7a5cfd3e-0247-4228-873d-5be563c4ee3b</link>     <description>Data comprise radiocaesium concentrations in soil, vegetation, wildlife and fungi analysed from samples collected from throughout Great Britain after the 1986 Chernobyl accident by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), formerly the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE). National level vegetation surveys were conducted in May 1986, October 1986 and Spring 1987. More intensive surveys of vegetation (grass and heather) and wildlife (grouse, fox, etc.) in restricted areas were carried out in Cumbria, Wales and North Yorkshire in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1993. Surveys of fungi were carried out between 1994 and 1997. The data are suitable for interpolation to create spatially variable surfaces suitable for input into models.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chernobyl</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deposition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>accident</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radiocaesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>North Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Yorkshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>GB</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fungi</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wildlife</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grasses</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heather</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pollution &amp; Environmental Risk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-25T09:02:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/fc65177d-b113-420e-a70b-05d3f42682d5\">     <title>Countryside Survey 2007 mapped estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/fc65177d-b113-420e-a70b-05d3f42682d5</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 2007 in a vector format.

Water samples were collected from the ecosystem of a Sitka spruce plantation at weekly intervals for six years.  The drainage system of the site had been designed to divide the plantation into a series of artificial catchments, three of which were designated experimental plots and clearfelled in the second year of sampling while three others were the control plots which remained unfelled until the end of the study.  This work formed part of a programme of field and laboratory work to determine the effects of felling plantation forest on soil processes.  Samples were collected by staff from the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) between 1981 and 1987. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>clear felling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>clearcutting</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conifers</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sitka spruce</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil processes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cumbria</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>forestry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drainage water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>forests</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-29T15:17:43Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/76a2bd9a-fb02-4f37-91b9-4835eb31ab7b\">     <title>Environmental and chemical determinands associated with phosphorus in Loch Leven bed sediments (2004 - 2005)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/76a2bd9a-fb02-4f37-91b9-4835eb31ab7b</link>     <description>This is a dataset obtained from analysis of lake sediment and overlying water from six sites along a depth gradient, in Loch Leven, Scotland, over a period of one year.

Modern land surface models require a characterisation of the land surface hydrological regime and this parameter allows the use of the TOPMODEL hydrological model to achieve this .This Geographic Information System layer is intended for use as topographic ancillary files for the TOPMODEL routing model option within the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. The topographic index variable here is directly comparable to the compound topographic index available from United States Geological Survey's Hydro1K at 30 sec resolution.
