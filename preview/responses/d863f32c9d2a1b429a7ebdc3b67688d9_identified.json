The Council's Governing Body and      Boards of Studies met for the first time in December 1955, though it was      governed by a Declaration of Trust dated 22 November 1956. The Council had two      Boards of Studies, in Engineering and in Technologies other than Engineering,      to create and administer awards for students in technical colleges who      completed courses in technology approved by the Governing Body (the Diploma in      Technology). In May 1959 the Council established the College of Technologists,      which granted Membership for research work. The Council handed its      responsibilities on to the Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA) in      1964.</p>  <p>Reference: Report December 1955 to July 1957, MSS.322/TA/109,      MSS.322/TA/101, file 1 and MSS.322/TA/100).</p>  </bioghist>  <scopecontent id=\"a3\">  <p>Subject Panel Correspondence, 1957-1964; Governing Body's papers,      1956-1964; Executive Committee papers, 1956-1963; Annual Report, 1959-1964;      papers relating to industrial training, 1958-1965; College of Technologists      papers, 1958-1965; Board of Scientific and Industrial Studies (BSIS) papers,      1959-1965; subject files relating to individual institutions, 1956-1964; Lord      Hives's correspondence, 1956-1964; publications, 1967.</p>  </scopecontent>  <arrangement id=\"a5\">  <p>The collection is uncatalogued.</p>  </arrangement>  <acqinfo id=\"a19\">  <p>This collection was deposited in the Centre by the Council for      National Academic Awards in 1993.</p>  </acqinfo>  <appraisal id=\"a21\">  <p> This collection has been weeded for duplicates.</p>  </appraisal>  <accruals id=\"a22\">  <p>Further deposits are expected.</p>  </accruals>  <accessrestrict id=\"a14\">  <p> There are no restrictions on access to these papers.</p>  </accessrestrict>  <userestrict id=\"a15\">  <p> There are no restrictions on the use of this archive, apart from      the requirements of copyright law. </p>  </userestrict>  <otherfindaid id=\"a8\">  <p> A temporary box list is available in paper format in the      Centre's searchroom.</p>  <p>An authority record exists for National Council for Technological      Awards (GB 152 AAR2279).</p>  </otherfindaid>  <relatedmaterial>  <p>Seventy files of the Council's reports, minutes and papers of      the Council and its committees etc., 1955-65, are available at the Public      Record Office (ref.
