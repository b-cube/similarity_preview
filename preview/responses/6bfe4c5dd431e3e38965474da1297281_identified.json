We have used generic titles for this current academic year (2014/15) because we only tend to have a very small number of part-time undergraduate students. Therefore for us, the generic titles are more convenient and less time-consuming.

Instead, we should adjust the fees and dates accordingly for those years and indicate in the course title which are the placement years.
