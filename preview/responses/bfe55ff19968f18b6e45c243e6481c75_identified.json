In England, part-time entrants fell by 42 per cent between 2008 and 2012 (HEFCE, 2014). Given that England\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds growing and ageing population has increased the stock of potential part-time students in recent years, demographic pressures seem unlikely to be a driver of the decline in part-time entrants. Rather, evidence suggests that the sharp decline in part-time entrants may be due to a combination of higher education policy and funding changes and challenging macroeconomic conditions, which have persisted beyond the end of the official recession. Part-time mature students may experience \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhigher education\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in very different ways, which in turn can impact in particular ways on their identity and vital sense of belonging. In widening the focus of traditional conceptions of HE, the research will examine how to better support mature part-time learners and in doing so enhance student experience and increase retention rates.</p> <p class=\"Default\">The project will be completed in June 2015 and a research seminar will be held at the Vaughan Centre for Lifelong Learning to disseminate the findings.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>pt91</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lifelong learning</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-14T13:11:11Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2015-archive-1/january/traumatised-children-worldwide-to-be-helped-by-major-project\">     <title>Traumatised children worldwide to be helped by major project</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2015-archive-1/january/traumatised-children-worldwide-to-be-helped-by-major-project</link>     <description>Professor Panos Vostanis to aid affected communities in low income countries</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p style=\"text-align: left;

to improve the way in which police officers collect reports from witnesses, strengthen the value of eyewitness reports in court, and improve the scientific foundation underpinning eyewitness

It is one of the most feared complications of general anaesthesia for both patients and anaesthetists.</p> <p>The largest ever study of awareness, the 5<sup>th</sup> National Audit Project (NAP5), which has been conducted over the last three years by the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) and the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) found a patient reporting rate of 1 per 19,000 operations. This incidence of spontaneous patient reports of awareness is much lower than estimates of awareness when patients are specifically asked about it after anaesthesia, which are as high as 1 in 600.</p> <p>The researchers - including Professor Michael Wang (pictured) from the University's <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/psychology\">School of Psychology</a> - studied 3 million general anaesthetics from every public hospital in UK and Ireland, and studied more than 300 new reports of awareness.</p> <p>The extensive study showed that the majority of episodes of awareness are short-lived, occur before surgery starts or after it finishes, and do not always cause concern to patients.\\ufffd\\ufffd Despite this, 51% of episodes led to distress and 41% to longer-term psychological harm. Sensations experienced included tugging, stitching, pain, paralysis and choking. Patients described feelings of dissociation, panic, extreme fear, suffocation and even dying. Longer-term psychological harm often included features of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>Professor Wang, Professor of Clinical Psychology at the University, is an author of the study. He said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOur research has demonstrated the importance of understanding the range of long term reactions to AAGA and the need to be familiar with the characteristics of post-traumatic stress disorder following AAGA as well as its effects on quality of life.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWe must understand the significance of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdawake paralysis\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and how this can lead to longer-term psychological impacts. Many patients are left with persistent psychological problems which greatly impair quality of life. Commonly AAGA patients present with post traumatic stress disorder, other new anxiety states and/or clinical depression.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <ul> <li><a

importance of the position of letters in words for young readers </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p> <p>Skilled readers are often able to make sense of words suffering from \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtypos\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and jumbled up letter orders as long as the beginning and end letters of the words are correct.</p> </p> <p>But a new study suggests that young developing readers also have a similar understanding of how these outside letters can help make sense of words.</p> <p>The study found that while developing young readers and skilled adult readers found it similarly difficult to correctly recognise anagrams that can form another word by switching the order of only the inside letters, both age groups found it equally easy to recognise anagrams when the outside letters also had to be switched around to form another word.</p> <p>This is because the brain struggles to keep track of the position of inside letters when recognising words but assigns special importance to the outside letters.</p> <p>The findings are important for understanding the role of letter position in children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds word recognition, including in dyslexia.</p> <p>The research team consisted of Dr Kevin Paterson, PhD student Victoria McGowan, who recently obtained a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFuture Research

explores how adolescents are affected by psychological disorders in warzones  </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>A new study led by Professor Panos Vostanis (pictured) from the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/psychology\">School of Psychology</a> has examined adolescent victims of conflict in the Gaza strip and has found that exposure to war-torn environments has a lasting and damaging effect on their psychological wellbeing.</p> <p>The paper, entitled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdTrauma, PTSD, Anxiety and Coping Strategies among Palestinians Adolescents Exposed to War in Gaza\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd has been published in the <i>Arab Journal of Psychiatry</i> and investigates types of traumatic events experienced by Palestinian adolescents exposed to war in Gaza in relation to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and coping strategies.</p> <p>Of the adolescents studied, the majority witnessed mutilated bodies on TV, were exposed to heavy artillery shelling, saw evidence of shelling and heard sonic sounds from jetfighters, leaving a lasting impression on many.\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Professor Vostanis said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThe toll on the mental health of these young people tends to be exacerbated by poverty, which is endemic in Gaza. It's a double whammy for many of them. As well as the conflict itself, they are also affected by how their parents respond, by the provision of basic needs and if there's a sense of helplessness.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2014/august/victims-of-war-how-gaza-conflict-will-traumatise-a-generation-of-adolescents\">Press Release </a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Psychology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-06T11:07:22Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
