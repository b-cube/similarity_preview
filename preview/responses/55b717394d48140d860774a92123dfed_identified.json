Yet, until recently social and cultural geographers have failed to pay much attention to this aspect of the world in which we live, with the most notable contributions deriving from historical perspectives. This study examines the work characterising this area of research before outlining possible reasons for the failure of consistent and comprehensive examination of the seas and ships for social and cultural geographers who take a more contemporary focus. The sea has been typically understood as inferior to and marginal from the land and invisible in modern consciousness, yet it is nonetheless a vital space and one that is integral to the workings of the world as we currently know it. This study travels through the ways in which modern-day examinations of the maritime world are developing before outlining future promises that are surfacing for more contemporary social and cultural geographies of the sea. The study offers an overview of the relationship between social and cultural geography and the sea, contending by way of a conclusion for a greater volume of contemporary work considering maritime spaces to expand and deepen geographic understandings of the watery world. </description> <dc:date>2010-09-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11394\"> <title>Negotiating the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPlace\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPlacement\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of Banal Tourist Souvenirs in the Home</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11394</link> <description>Negotiating the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPlace\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPlacement\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of Banal Tourist Souvenirs in the Home Peters, Kimberley Anne Souvenirs have been largely ignored in geographic work on tourism. This paper adds to the body of literature concerned with \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtourism geographies\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd by considering the partial lives of one type of souvenir; those labelled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbanal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. This paper explores the negotiations that arise when such souvenirs (material objects from the exotic, extraordinary, temporary place of tourism) are implanted in the usual, ordinary place of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhome\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. It is argued the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdplacement\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of souvenirs in the home stems from the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdplace\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the souvenir holds for owners, via their enmeshment in social relationships, processes of fetishization and questions of authenticity. This paper asserts that \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbanal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd souvenirs (tea towels, bookmarks, food and drink) however \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdordinary\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in appearance, and alike to items usually found at home, are just as likely to be placed in significant ways as supposedly authentic, hand-crafted souvenir goods. This paper thus argues that souvenirs offer a novel frame for thinking geographically about tourism. </description> <dc:date>2011-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11393\"> <title>Sinking the radio pirates: exploring British strategies of governance in the North Sea, 1964-1991</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/11393</link> <description>Sinking the radio pirates: exploring British strategies of governance in the North Sea, 1964-1991 Peters, Kimberley Anne Studies of offshore broadcasting stations such as Radio Caroline have often focused on the media communication impacts of the phenomenon, rather than the ramifications these so-called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpirate\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd stations had over the governance of sea-space. This paper examines the strategies by which successive British governments sought to regulate offshore \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpirate\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd broadcasts emanating from outside territorial boundaries, onboard ships in the North Sea. Between 1964 and 1991 it is contended that two different regulatory methods were enacted in order to control radio \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpirates\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd; firstly a non-marine/territorial approach, which sought to govern the sea through controlling activities within Britain\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds borders; and secondly, through a marine/non-territorial approach, which was aimed at regulating the ocean through managing the use of extra-territorial international space; the high seas. It is argued that the latter approach was particularly problematic as it challenged Britain\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds long-held ideology of maritime freedom. The paper makes a significant contribution in understanding Britain\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds legal and political relationship with the ocean and to the wider move towards \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgeographies of the sea\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, through examining shifts in the governance of ocean space surrounding this episode in maritime history. </description> <dc:date>2011-09-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
