The original work started in the 1990s but lapsed in recent years due to data collection issues. During the second semester in 2010-11, using a paper questionnaire, first and second years across the University were targetted. The findings raised a number of interesting points, for example: some students still find IT challenging; although laptop ownership is high, students do not seem to be planning to carry their laptops to &#13; the campus; Facebook appears to be used significantly for academic &#13; purposes. </summary> <dc:date>2012-02-27T16:39:18Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Collaboration Tools Survey</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/141\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/141</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:35Z</updated> <published>2012-02-13T14:55:29Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Collaboration Tools Survey Report of the ITC short-life working group established to appraise the use of collaborative tools across the university in support of teaching and learning, research, and administration.

One organisation questionnaire was sent initially, then, if the organisation fitted the 'quango' profile, a further organisation questionnaire was sent together with board member questionnaires. A QUANGO is a Quasi-Autonomous Non-Governmental Organisation.  The replies were entered into two databases; one for organisations and one for board members. The databases contain details of over 250 organisations and approximately 600 individual members. The criteria for inclusion in the database are that the organisation receives public funds which it also disburses and that it's board members are not elected. </summary> <dc:date>2009-10-15T12:05:56Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Scottish Election Results 1997 - 2009</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/24\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/24</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:36Z</updated> <published>2009-10-06T16:18:06Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Scottish Election Results 1997 - 2009 The dataset contains all national, European and by-election results for Holyrood and Westminter elections in Scotland since 1997.
