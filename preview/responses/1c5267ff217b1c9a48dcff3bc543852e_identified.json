Analysis of HVAC, size, occupancy density, building age, location and rateable value were considered. While newer offices were shown to have lower typical fossil-thermal consumption than older offices, this was counterbalanced by higher electrical consumption, resulting in higher typical CO2 emissions. This has implications for the UK's emissions reduction targets for 2050, indicating that while building regulations that focus on thermal performance have been successful, a focus on electrical consumption (both regulated and unregulated) is key.&#13; &#13; The results were also compared with existing benchmarks for all UK offices, splitting the sample into four generic types, and compared to a similar smaller study of private offices. This indicated that public offices typically used less energy than the general benchmarks had previously predicted, particularly for prestige offices. This is the accepted manuscript.

Protected housing in England is referred to as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlisted\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; housing managed by English Heritage. The result of the study demonstrates that balanced&#13; approaches can be developed to retrofit listed housing by taking into account occupant&#13; behaviour factors, to meet the requirement of both energy efficiency and heritage&#13; conservation. A case study of the Brunswick Centre in London shows that the highest&#13; household energy use can be 2.2 times higher than average consumption. According to the&#13; modelling results from Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) software, the impact of&#13; positive behavioural change ranges up to 62% to 86% of the total potential savings in the&#13; tested dwellings, where the lower behaviour change effect is associated with a higher retrofit&#13; level. However, rebound behaviour could offset estimated energy saving from physical&#13; improvement. Based on the findings, a framework of intervention measures is developed,&#13; which demonstrates that the proportion for behavioural change and building technology&#13; varies with respect to household energy use level. In summary, this study shows that in listed&#13; housing behavioural change has the potential to bring substantial energy saving far exceeding&#13; that from physical improvements, and thus tackling behavioural change plays a pivotal role in&#13; developing integrative strategies for listed housing retrofit.

Alan; Giridharan, Renganathan; Lomas, Kevin J. The late 1970\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds design for the Rosie Maternity Hospital on the Addenbrookes campus&#13; in Cambridge is a recurring type across the UK National Health Service, a framed&#13; three storey courtyard configuration in brick masonry. It was selected as a case study&#13; project for the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDesign and Delivery of Robust Hospitals in a Changing Climate\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; (DeDeRHECC) project, pursuing the methodology developed for that research.&#13; Environmental data was collected within representative spaces within the hospital,&#13; with some difficulty, over a two year period revealing overheating in mild conditions&#13; relative to a 24o C threshold for sleep but concealed within the customary 28o C&#13; threshold marking the upper limit of acceptable conditions. The building was modeled&#13; against current climate data to predict 2010 conditions, calibrated against observed&#13; data in 2010, and then against the CIBSE predictive climate database for the 2030\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds&#13; for the location suggesting a progressive deterioration in peak conditions. Four&#13; adaptive intervention schemes were subsequently developed: an \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdenlightened\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; industry standard \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpassiv-haus\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd option of super insulation, sealed glazing and heat&#13; recovery; a lower technology based scheme promoting natural cross-ventilation by&#13; providing greater opening glazing area, opening up the plan, sun shading and&#13; additional insulation; an enhanced natural ventilation scheme glazing over the&#13; courtyards to provide supply air winter gardens, and an advanced natural ventilation&#13; option pursuing Passive Downdraught Cooling. All four schemes were modeled&#13; against the predictive climate database, their performance compared and the schemes fully costed to yield relative \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdvalue for money\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd guidance to Trusts. This is the accepted manuscript. It will be embargoed until the final version is published by Sage. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Solar energy and urban morphology: Scenarios for increasing the renewable energy potential of neighbourhoods in London</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245934\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Sarralde, Juan Jos\\ufffd\\ufffd</name> </author> <author> <name>Quinn, David James</name> </author> <author> <name>Wiesmann, Daniel</name> </author> <author> <name>Steemers, Koen</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245934</id> <updated>2014-10-03T14:40:51Z</updated> <published>2014-07-07T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Solar energy and urban morphology: Scenarios for increasing the renewable energy potential of neighbourhoods in London Sarralde, Juan Jos\\ufffd\\ufffd; Quinn, David James; Wiesmann, Daniel; Steemers, Koen Amongst academics and practitioners working in the fields of urban planning and design, there has been an on-going discussion regarding the relationships between urban morphology and environmental sustainability. A main focus of analysis has been to investigate whether the form of cities and neighbourhoods can be related to their energy efficiency, especially regarding the energy intensity of buildings and transportation. However, to analyse the overall energy performance of urban systems, both the consumption and the generation of resources need to be assessed. In terms of urban environmental sustainability, the potential to generate renewable energy within the city boundaries is a research topic of growing interest, being solar energy one of the main resources available.&#13; This study uses neighbourhood-scale statistical models to explore the relationships between aggregated urban form descriptors and the potential to harvest solar energy within the city. Different possible scenarios of urban morphology in Greater London are analysed and variables of urban form are tested with the aim of increasing the solar energy potential of neighbourhoods. Results show that by optimising combinations of up to eight variables of urban form the solar irradiation of roofs could be increased by ca. 9%, while that of fa\\ufffd\\ufffdades could increase by up to 45%. Furthermore, based on these results, a series of trade-offs needed for the optimisation of conflicting variables is unveiled. Finally, some recommendations for design strategies are offered with the aim of helping urban planners and designers improve the solar energy potential of new or existing urban areas.
