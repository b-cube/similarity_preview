Since the TEI rules and recomendations are expressed in XML, TEI users can take advantage of the abundance of XML tools developed for general use. In addition, the TEI community develops and distributes TEI-specific tools.</p>             <p>Some tools are maintained and distributed directly by the TEI: for instance, the Roma tool for schema customization is an integral part of the publication of the TEI Guidelines, though the underlying tool may also be installed and used separately. Similarly, the stylesheets that are used by the TEI itself to convert TEI documents into various formats are distributed here for use and adaptation by others. Tools maintained by the TEI are described in more detail below and are open-source, <ref target=\"../Guidelines/access.xml#licensing\">made available under the terms and conditions of both Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License and a BSD 2-Clause license</ref>.</p>             <p>Others tools are contributed by members of the TEI community and are not maintained by the TEI. These might include tools for authoring and editing, for publishing collections of TEI documents online, or for generating visualizations of metrical structure. The community is strongly encouraged to contribute tools that may be generally useful, to <ref target=\"http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Category:Tools\">inventory them on the TEI wiki</ref>, and to adapt or improve existing tools when allowed under an open-source license. Note that the TEI does not endorese any particular tool that it does not maintain and distribute.</p>             <p>There is also a <ref target=\"../Activities/SIG/Tools/\">Special Interest Group on Tools</ref>.</p>              <div xml:id=\"roma\"><head>Generation of schemas and documentation: Roma</head>                 <p><ref target=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/\">Roma</ref> is a web-based application which allows TEI users to                   generate P5-compatible schemas and documentation. Roma is useful for all TEI customization development, whether you want to create a simple TEI schema by selecting a few of the most relevant TEI modules for your project, or want to do a more complex customization involving modifications to specific elements. Roma can also help you generate TEI documentation in languages other than English (for more detail, see the section on internationalization below). For detailed instructions on using Roma, see <ref target=\"../Guidelines/Customization/use_roma.xml\">Customizing the TEI with Roma</ref>. A command-line version of Roma (called <soCalled>roma</soCalled>) is also available and can be installed and run locally; a description and instructions for use can be found <ref target=\"../Guidelines/Customization/odds.xml#romacommandline\">here</ref>. The source code for Roma                  is available from the <ref target=\"http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106328&amp;package_id=141128\">TEI Sourceforge site</ref>.  Roma is the P5 equivalent of the                     older                      <ref target=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Vault/P4/pizza.html\">TEI Pizza Chef</ref>                     a web-based tool that builds customized                     TEI DTDs compatible with P4 and earlier versions of the Guidelines.</p>             </div>             <div><head>Stylesheets for converting TEI documents to various formats</head>                                  <p>The TEI maintains a library of <ref target=\"./Stylesheets/\">XSL stylesheets</ref> developed by Sebastian Rahtz,                      which can convert TEI XML files to HTML, LaTeX, or XSL:FO documents. These stylesheets are designed for specific purposes and are not intended as general-purpose conversion tools. Other                     XSL and CSS stylesheets are listed in the stylesheets section of the <ref target=\"http://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/Stylesheets\">TEI wiki</ref>, and                     all TEI users are encouraged to contribute their own stylesheets to this collection.</p>             </div>             <div>                 <head>Conversion to and from TEI: OxGarage</head>                 <p><ref target=\"http://www.tei-c.org/oxgarage/\">OxGarage</ref> is a web, and RESTful, service to manage the transformation of documents between a variety of formats. The majority of transformations use the Text Encoding Initiative format as a pivot format. It is a good tool for conversion from TEI to Word (.docx), or Word (.docx) to TEI, but also does many other formats.</p>             </div>             <div><head>Internationalization of the TEI</head>             <p>One important tool developed by the TEI is the system for generating versions of the Guidelines in languages other than English. This initiative, funded in part by the <ref target=\"http://www.allc.org/\">ALLC</ref>, provides a framework for managing translations of the TEI reference documentation, element names, attribute names and values, and potentially the prose of the TEI Guidelines themselves. Work is currently under way to translate the reference documentation and the element and attribute names into five languages: French, Spanish, German, Chinese, and Japanese. Other languages to be covered in the future if funding and effort permit include Hindi, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Slovenian, and Tibetan. With this framework in place, TEI users will be able to generate internationalized versions of the TEI using the Roma interface described above.
