The vector data file is included in \"Faults_OffshoreSanFrancisco.zip,\" which is accessible from http://pubs.usgs.gov/ds/781/OffshoreSanFrancisco/data_catalog_OffshoreSanFrancisco.html.  The Offshore of San Francisco map area straddles the right-lateral transform boundary between the North American and Pacific plates and is cut by several active faults that cumulatively form a distributed shear zone, including the San Andreas Fault, the eastern strand of the San Gregorio Fault, the Golden Gate Fault, and the Potato Patch Fault (Bruns and others, 2002; Ryan and others, 2008). These faults are covered by Holocene sediments (mostly units Qms, Qmsb, Qmst) with no seafloor expression, and are mapped using seismic-reflection data (see field activities S-15-10-NC and F-2-07-NC). The San Andreas Fault is the primary plate-boundary structure and extends northwest across the map area; it intersects the shoreline 10 km north of the map area at Bolinas Lagoon, and 3 km south of the map area at Mussel Rock. This section of the San Andreas Fault has an estimated slip rate of 17 to 24 mm/yr (U.S. Geological Survey, 2010), and the devastating Great 1906 California earthquake (M 7.8) is thought to have nucleated on the San Andreas a few kilometers offshore of San Francisco within the map area (Bolt, 1968; Lomax, 2005).  The San Andreas Fault forms the boundary between two distinct basement terranes, Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks of the Franciscan Complex to the east, and Late Cretaceous granitic and older metamorphic rocks of the Salinian block to the west. Franciscan Complex rocks (unit KJf, undivided) form seafloor outcrops at and north of Point Lobos adjacent to onland exposures. The Franciscan is divided into 13 different units for the onshore portion of this geologic map based on different lithologies and ages, but the unit cannot be similarly divided in the offshore because of a lack of direct observation and (or) sampling.  Faults were primarily mapped by interpretation of seismic reflection profile data (see field activities S-15-10-NC and F-2-07-NC).  The seismic reflection profiles were collected between 2007 and 2010.

Faults lines were digitized by heads-up screen digitization on to shot-point picks from seismic-line navigation data - each shot point has an associated lat/long in the survey data. Error is introduced from layback, as well as from interpretation of oblique features, so horizontal accuracy of fault and fold location is estimated to be on the order of 10 to 20 meters. </horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP)</origin> <pubdate>2013</pubdate> <title> Seismic-reflection data acquisition data of field activity S-15-10-NC in offshore Pescadero from 08/02/2010 to 08/04/2010 </title> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Menlo Park, CA</pubplace> <publish>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , Coastal and Marine Geology (CMG)</publish> </pubinfo> <onlink>http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/gos/s-15-10-nc.fmeta.xml</onlink> <onlink>http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/s/s1510nc/html/s-15-10-nc.meta.html</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>ASCII lat/long shot point files</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20100802</begdate> <enddate>20100804</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>S-15-10-NC</srccitea> <srccontr>Digital seismic data used to interpret subsurface geologic structure</srccontr> </srcinfo> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP)</origin> <pubdate>2013</pubdate> <title> Geophysical data of field activity F-2-07-NC in Ano Nuevo to San Francisco from 03/22/2007 to 04/06/2007 </title> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Menlo Park, CA</pubplace> <publish>U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) , Coastal and Marine Geology (CMG)</publish> </pubinfo> <onlink>http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/gos/f-2-07-nc.fmeta.xml</onlink> <onlink>http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/infobank/f/f207nc/html/f-2-07-nc.meta.html</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>ASCII lat/long shot point files</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20070322</begdate> <enddate>20070406</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>F-2-07-NC</srccitea> <srccontr>Digital seismic data used to interpret subsurface geologic structure</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc>Faults were mapped onto shot lines based on the latitude and longitude of seismic picks from field activity S-15-10-NC.</procdesc> <procdate>2011</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> Faults were mapped onto shot lines based on the latitude and longitude of seismic picks from field activity F-2-07-NC. </procdesc> <procdate>2011</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> <ptvctinf> <sdtsterm> <sdtstype>String</sdtstype> <ptvctcnt>14</ptvctcnt> </sdtsterm> </ptvctinf> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn>WGS 1984 UTM Zone 10N</mapprojn> <transmer> <sfctrmer>0.9996</sfctrmer> <longcm>-123.0</longcm> <latprjo>0.0</latprjo> <feast>500000.0</feast> <fnorth>0.0</fnorth> </transmer> </mapproj> <planci> <plance>coordinate pair</plance> <coordrep> <absres>0.0001</absres> <ordres>0.0001</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>Meter</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>D WGS 1984</horizdn> <ellips>WGS 1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257223563</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>Faults</enttypl> <enttypd>lines representing mapped faults</enttypd> <enttypds>This report</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>OBJECTID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl> <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Label</attrlabl> <attrdef>feature label</attrdef> <attrdefs>This report</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>text field containing feature names if they are named</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>RuleID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Representation rule identifier</attrdef> <attrdefs>This report</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom> This field contains the representation rule in the ArcGIS file geodatabase that applied dashed or solid lines to faults.
