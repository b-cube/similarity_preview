Fresh from six years of field work, I benefited hugely from the opportunity to step back and place my experience from crises such as Rwanda and Kosovo into a broader historical and policy context. This gave a breadth and a depth to my analysis that I think stayed with me, and allowed me to take on much more senior roles in the future, having resumed full-time work. Soon after my Master's, I was doing high-level policy consulting for the UN and other think thanks, which in turn led me to be recruited by Save the Children to lead their humanitarian work globally.</p> <p>The course offered me just the right mix of new topics as well as the chance to reflect upon and share my own experience. I relaxed, and loved the chance to resume full-time education in Oxford. I remain friends with many of the teaching staff as well as my fellow students that year, and look back on my decision to take the course as a really good one that has not only benefitted me, but, far more importantly, has had an indirect positive impact on those I have tried to help in the course of the more challenging jobs I have held since I left.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jo Boyce</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2014-03-17T13:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>StudentDetail</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
