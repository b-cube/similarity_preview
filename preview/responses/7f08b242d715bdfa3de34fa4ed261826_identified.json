The Omnibus survey is an attitudes survey which identifies what the population as a whole think are 'necessities': things that everyone should be able to afford and which no one should have to go without.   Data were collected in Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA), and in Scotland, England and Wales by the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen)</abstract>       <sumDscr>         <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2012-05-02T00:00:00Z\">02 May 2012</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2012-08-28T00:00:00Z\">28 August 2012</timePrd>         <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2010-04-01T00:00:00Z\">01 April 2010</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z\">31 March 2014</collDate>         <nation>Northern Ireland</nation>         <nation>Scotland</nation>         <nation>England and Wales</nation>         <geogCover>United Kingdom</geogCover>         <geogUnit>Regions</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>families and households</anlyUnit>         <dataKind>Alpha-numeric</dataKind>         <dataKind>Audio</dataKind>         <dataKind>Numeric</dataKind>         <dataKind>Textual</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <collMode>Different methods were used for the NI and GB Omnibus samples.  These are described below. GB sample: The sample was obtained using a multi-stage sampling design. First, 143 postcode sectors were selected from the small users Postcode Address File (PAF). All sectors in mainland Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), excluding the area of Scotland north of the Caledonian Canal were covered.  Prior to selection, the postcode sectors had been ordered by  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd GOR; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd percentage of households where the household reference person was in NS-SEC categories 1-2 with variable banding used to create three equal-sized strata per GOR; and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ranking by percentage of homes that were owner-occupied.  The sample of 143 postcode sectors was systematically selected from this list, with probability proportional to size.  Next, 20 addresses were sampled from the PAF from each selected postcode sector. This gave a total of 3,060 issued addresses, each selected with equal probability.  Low response meant 300 additional addresses needed to be selected for the sample. Twenty of the 143 PSUs were selected at random and 15 additional addresses were selected from each one. This meant a total of 3160 addresses were issued in total: 123 of the selected PSUs contained 20 addresses and 20 PSUs contained 35 addresses.  A single adult (defined as anyone aged 16 or over) was then selected at random out of all adults residing at that address to take part in the survey.  Fieldwork Fieldwork began on 2 May 2012 and ended on 28th August 2012. Interviews were carried out by NatCen interviewers using computer assisted personal interviewing techniques. Computer assisted interviewing improves data quality by including accurate routing to the relevant questions for a particular respondent and consistency checks on responses. All interviewers at NatCen receive extensive training in administering face-to-face surveys including training in converting refusals at each address and, once an interview has been secured, asking questions in a non-biased way. Interviewers were also briefed on the project to inform them of the particular survey procedures and content of the questionnaire. New interviewers attended a briefing in person. More experienced interviewers received a home-briefing pack and were asked to complete an assignment to ensure they had taken the time to read their instructions and practise the questionnaire. A letter was sent to each address in advance of the interviewer calling. The letter briefly described the purpose of the survey, the coverage of the questionnaire and reassured potential respondents that their answers would be treated in strict confidence. A \\ufffd\\ufffd30 voucher was given to each respondent who took part in the survey. A copy of the advance letter can be found in Appendix 1.  To improve response interviewers call at each address at least six times and up to a maximum of nine times, at different times of the day and at different times during the week. The first three calls must be made after 6pm Monday to Thursday or at the weekend when research has found that these are the optimum times for securing an interview. Interviewers recorded the time, date and outcome of all calls and checks were made by field management.  Non-contacts were not accepted unless the pattern, as well as the number of calls conformed to the basic requirements that normally at least one call must be made at a weekend, and one on a weekday evening.  ++++++++++++++++++ Northern Ireland Omnibus Survey: Technical Notes  The Sample The sample for the June survey consisted of a systematic random sample of addresses selected from the Land and Property Services Agency list of private addresses. This is the most up-to-date listing of private households and is made available to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency for research purposes. People living in institutions (though not in private households in such institutions) are excluded. A total of 2,200 addresses were selected for interview. The Land and Property Services Agency provides a good sampling frame of addresses, but contains no information about the number of people living at an address. Further selection stages were therefore required to convert the listing of addresses to a listing of individuals from which one person (the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdselected respondent\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) is chosen to complete the questionnaire. Interviewers are instructed to call at each address issued in their assignments. At the first stage of the survey, they have to identify the number of households resident at the address and, where necessary, select one using a selection table.  The interviewers then list all members of the household who are eligible for inclusion in the sample: that is, all persons currently aged 16 or over living at the address. From this listing of eligible adults, the interviewer's computer selected one adult at random using a computerised Kish grid. This person, the selected respondent, is then asked to complete the interview. The Necessities questions \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd split sample approach Capturing responses to the Necessities questions from respondents in this particular Omnibus survey was carried out using two different approaches. Once the systematic random sample of addresses was selected each address was assigned a Serial Number from 1 to 2200. The electronic questionnaire was programmed so that cases with an odd-numbered Serial Number were routed to the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsort card\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd version of the Necessities module, while those cases with an even-numbered Serial Number were routed to the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCAPI\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd version of the Necessities module. This methodology ensured that both samples were geographically representative. The \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsort card\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd version of the necessities module consisted of five questions. For each of the first four questions, respondents were asked to sort a set of coloured shuffle cards into two boxes. Items or activities that the respondent thought were necessary were to be placed in Box A on the exercise card and Box B for items/activities considered to be desirable but not necessary. The fifth question on Public Services required the use of a show card. The \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCAPI\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd version of the necessities module included the same four lists of items and activities as the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsort card\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd version however, in these cases, the respondent used the computer to decide which items and activities they considered as necessary or not necessary (i.e. a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdself-completion\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd module). The electronic questionnaire was programmed to randomise the order in which items and activities appear for each interview conducted. Note: the question on Public Services was accidentally omitted from the questionnaire for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCAPI\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd respondents.  The Fieldwork Addresses were issued to a panel of around 260 interviewers in the middle of May 2012. The fieldwork period was 6th June to the 7th July 2012. </collMode>         <sources />       </dataColl>     </method>     <dataAccs>       <setAvail>         <accsPlac>UK Data Service</accsPlac>       </setAvail>       <useStmt>         <contact>&lt;a href=\"mailto:dave.gordon@bristol.ac.uk\"&gt;Dave Gordon, &lt;/a&gt;</contact>       </useStmt>     </dataAccs>     <othrStdyMat />   </stdyDscr> </codeBook>",
