During the 2008 Legislative Session, HB972 was adopted which effected the Forest Conservation Act's reporting and enforcement requirements. On or before July 1st of each year, the DNR shall submit to the Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee and the House Environmental Matters Committee a statewide report compiled from local authorities. Included with this report DNR will also be required to submit, to the best practicable extent, the size shape and location of all conserved and planted forest areas submitted in an electronic geographic information system or other similar computer aided design format.</abstract>    <purpose>This dataset is intended to satisfy the new geospatial reporting requirements for local jurisdictions beginning with the 2010 fiscal year reporting period. In addition, this dataset contains FCA easements held by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources primarlily for the time period of FY2009 to present.</purpose>   </descript>     <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>Not Pro</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>publication date</current>   </timeperd>     <status>    <progress>In work</progress>    <update>Annually</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-79.48715210</westbc>     <eastbc>-75.04589844</eastbc>     <northbc>39.72401428</northbc>     <southbc>37.91142273</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>Ramona GIS Inventory</themekt>     <themekey>planningCadastre</themekey>        </theme>    <place>                 <placekt>None</placekt>                 <placekey>Maryland</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>This service, or any portion thereof, can be freely distributed as long as the metadata entry is not modified or deleted.
