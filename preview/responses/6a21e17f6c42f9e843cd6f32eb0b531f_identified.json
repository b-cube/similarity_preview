With the rise of a Daoist trend referred to as Thunder Rites (&lt;em id=&quot;tinymce&quot; class=&quot;mceContentBody &quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;leifa&lt;/em&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd), which matured during the mid- to late-Song \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Dynasty (960\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1279) and did not solely pertain to any particular branch of Daoism, a new type of (often Buddho-Daoist) ritual practice had emerged, largely exorcistic in nature, that would eventually be incorporated into classical Daoist traditions. Practitioners of Thunder Rites were either members of the established Daoist orthodoxy or itinerant thaumaturges, referred to as ritual masters (&lt;em id=&quot;tinymce&quot; class=&quot;mceContentBody &quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;fashi&lt;/em&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). Buddhist Esoteric knowledge in the Song Dynasty was so wide-spread that it did not only find its way from \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcourt to country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, but even back to court again\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnamely through Thunder Rite ritual masters like Wang Wenqing, who acted as the imperial preceptor of Emperor Huizong and in whose hybrid Buddho-Daoist productions of ritual texts the Buddhist traces had become almost invisible.</description>            <dc:creator>Carmen Meinert</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-12-31</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-12-31</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>1</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/ejecar/article/view/736\">        <title>Looting the Pantheon: On the Daoist Appropriation of Buddhist Divinities and Saints</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/ejecar/article/view/736</link>            <description>Scholars working on different Christian cults in medieval Europe are wont to deal with the rather commonplace, although highly interesting, cases of relic thefts and the associated co-option of particular saints and their cults. Such cases reinforce our perception of the period as a dynamic and creative one in regard to the transfer and proliferation of Christian cultic practices to new areas and social contexts beyond their original locales. However, in the cases I shall discuss in the following, you will not be treated to cases of intra-religious take-overs or the simple borrowing or copying of relics within a single religious tradition, but you will be presented with cases in which one religion appropriated entire cults, divinities and saints from another religion. &lt;br /&gt;What we shall see here concerns gods and saints in what we may term ``inter-religious transit&quot; and their ultimate adoption and inclusion into different\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdand as I hope to demonstrate\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdentirely new spiritual contexts. This paper will deal with a major aspect of the religious exchange between Buddhism and Daoism in medieval China, namely that of Daoist appropriation of Buddhist divinities and saints. &lt;br /&gt;The related and highly important issue concerning the typological copying of deities for similar, functional purposes that we see in both the Buddhist and Daoist material will not be dealt with here for practical reasons. Although it is of equal importance for our understanding of the inter-religious appropriations that took place in the meeting and co-existence in the same cultural space of the two religions, that issue is so extensive that it would require a separate discussion in its own right.</description>            <dc:creator>Henrik H.

The temple complex at K\\ufffd\\ufffdyasan is situated in the mountainous interior of modern Wakayama prefecture, Japan, which in the pre-modern era corresponded to the province of Kii \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. In the early medieval period, K\\ufffd\\ufffdyasan was developing a system of local rule centred on control of private estates (&lt;em id=&quot;tinymce&quot; class=&quot;mceContentBody &quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;sh\\ufffd\\ufffden&lt;/em&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) in the area surrounding the temple. This was an era of decentralization, in which national authority and systems of rule were losing their potency in the face of rising localization and the increasingly central role of the warrior class. With warriors taking an ever greater share of estate revenue and assuming greater administrative control within &lt;em id=&quot;tinymce&quot; class=&quot;mceContentBody &quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;sh\\ufffd\\ufffden&lt;/em&gt;, estate proprietors such as K\\ufffd\\ufffdyasan were faced with diminishing income, leading to centrally-located temples and aristocratic families effectively losing all control over distant estates. Located in the mountains of Kii and overlooking the estates along the Ki river, K\\ufffd\\ufffdyasan by contrast was close to its land and was strongly involved in warrior society.\\ufffd\\ufffd A major facet of this relationship with warrior estate managers was the &lt;em&gt;kish\\ufffd\\ufffdmon&lt;/em&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, or written vow, signed at the temple as both a performative act of submission to its spiritual authority and as a contract and code of conduct between proprietor and estate manager (&lt;em id=&quot;tinymce&quot; class=&quot;mceContentBody &quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;sh\\ufffd\\ufffdkan&lt;/em&gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd).</description>            <dc:creator>Philip Garrett</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2013-12-31</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2013-12-31</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>1</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/ejecar/article/view/739\">        <title>Buddho\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDaoism in medieval and early pre-modern China: A report on recent findings concerning influences and shared religious practices</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/ejecar/article/view/739</link>            <description>This comprises a report on a project conducted at the Ruhr University, Bochum, on the interrelationship and exchanges between China&#039;s two major religious traditions, Buddhism and Daoism, during the medieval and early pre-modern periods. While the departure for the research was primarily concerned with the mutual exchanges of ritual techniques and technology, i.e.~ritual practices in general, concepts of ritual, ritual implements, ritual language, rituals in specific cultic contexts etc., I gradually expanded my interest to include a wider range of topics relating to the exchanges between Buddhism and Daoism in China including the appropriation of divinities and saints, integrated beliefs and practices involving elements from both religions, apocryphal writings, conceptualizations concerning specific religious themes in which ideas and beliefs from both Buddhism and Daoism were brought together. Among other issues dealt with is the manner in which such concepts of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsecrecy\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe netherworld\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd were formulated and constructed in the Buddho\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDaoist exchanges.</description>            <dc:creator>Henrik H.
