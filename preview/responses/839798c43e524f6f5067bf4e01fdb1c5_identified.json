Wind Planning Areas in this dataset represent up to six different types of announcements within the US Federal Register that can be used to show the current status of an area that is being considered for Wind Power Development. Individual projects are listed by state below. Previous Wind Planning Areas that are now designated as leases can be found on the BOEM Leases Shapefile. Metadata for the leases can be found here. MassachusettsThe Wind Energy Area is located off the coast of Massachusetts beginning approximately 12 nmi south of Martha's Vineyard and 13 nautical miles southwest of Nantucket.

They are as follows:   Request for Interest (RFI) - Areas that BOEM publishes in the Federal Register to solicit nominations of interest for leasing and additional information.  This is the first step in the planning and leasing process.   Call for Information (Call) - Areas that BOEM publishes in the Federal Register to solicit nominations of interest for leasing and additional information.  This is the next step in the planning and leasing process.  Although in some cases (New Jersey) BOEM may decide to start the process with this type of notice.   Request For Competitive Interest (RFCI) - an area that BOEM publishes in the Federal Register to solicit additional nominations of interest to determine whether or not competititve interest exists.    Determiniation of No Competitive Interest (DNCI) - an area that BOEM publishes in the Federal Register in which they have determined that no competitive interests exists.   Proposed Sale Notice (PSN) - a notice published by BOEM in the Federal Register that describes the proposed areas to be offered for leasing and the proposed conditions of the lease sale.  This notice would not be published until after the NEPA review has been completed.   Finale Sale Notice (FSN) - a notice BOEM publishes in the Federal Register that describes the final areas to be offered, and describes the final conditions of a lease sale.   Note - WEAs are a special designation that is part of a different data layer. Note - Leases are part of a different data layer. </eaover></overview></eainfo><distinfo><resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc><distliab>Although these data have been processed successfully on a computer system at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the accuracy or utility of the data on any other system or for general or scientific purposes, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty.
