A  national sample of high school seniors and their parents was initially  interviewed in 1965 with subsequent surveys of the same individuals  conducted in 1973, 1982, and 1997. This data collection consists of  the fourth wave of youth interviews conducted in 1997. Individuals who  were identified and located from Wave III (1982) were reinterviewed  for this wave. Information was gathered on respondents' political  interest, party identification, political participation, interest in  public affairs, issue positions, group evaluations, civic  orientations, attitudes and behaviors over time, partisanship, and  electoral behavior. Respondents were queried about their views on  politics, concept of a good citizen, faith in government, and  attitudes toward federal government. Respondents were also asked to  indicate their feelings toward labor unions, activist groups, and  politicians, and to rate the influence level of certain groups.  Additional information was gathered on respondents' personal and  family changes since 1982. Summary variables from previous waves of  this study are also available. Background variables include age, sex,  religious orientation, level of religious participation, marital  status, ethnicity, educational status and background, place of residence, family income, and employment status.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1965\" cycle=\"P1\">1965</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1997\" cycle=\"P1\">1997</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1997-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-04</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1997-07\" cycle=\"P1\">1997-07</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit>                     <universe>All high school seniors in the United States in 1965.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data, and event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The data collection consists of individuals from the Wave  III panel of the original 1965 Youth-Parent Socialization Study  participants who were located and reinterviewed.
