It does so by analyzing data secured  from face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of urban  Ukrainian men and women in 1992-1993, together with a follow-up survey  three to three and a half years later of all those respondents who at  the time of the initial survey were either employed or were seeking  paid employment. The Study found that the over-time correlations --   the stabilities -- of two underlying dimensions of personality's  self-directedness of orientation and a sense of well-being or distress  were startlingly low, by comparison not only to the United States at a  time of much greater social stability, but also to Poland at the same  time as the Ukrainian study, albeit at a later stage of transition.  The stability of a third fundamental dimension of personality --  intellectual flexibility -- was higher than those of self-directedness  of orientation and distress, but considerably lower than past research  had led us to expect. Still, despite rapidly changing social and  economic conditions and great instability of personality, the  fundamental relationships of social structure with personality were  remarkably consistent over time and, with the partial exception of  those with the sense of well-being or distress, were quite similar to  those of both socialist and advanced capitalist societies during times  of apparent social stability. The analyses suggest that consistency in  the relationships between social structure and personality despite  great change both in social structure and in personality results from  the continued stability of proximate conditions of life that link  position in the larger social structure to individual personality and  the continued strength of those linkages. Notable among these  proximate conditions, for those people who were employed at the times  of both the baseline and follow-up surveys, is the substantive  complexity of their work. Respondents were asked to describe their  current occupations and job titles and to comment on whether they were  satisfied with their jobs and whether they had worked more than one  job at a time. Other questions included the number of hours the  respondent spent reading, writing, cooking, interacting with family  members, socializing with friends or family, and performing household  chores. Demographic variables include the respondent's age, sex,  birthplace, marital status, education, parents' education, number of  children, ages of children, occupation, nationality, religious affiliation, and native language.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1992\" cycle=\"P1\">1992</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1993\" cycle=\"P1\">1993</timePrd>                                                       <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1996\" cycle=\"P2\">1996</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1992\" cycle=\"P1\">1992</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1993\" cycle=\"P1\">1993</collDate>                                               <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1996\" cycle=\"P2\">1996</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Ukraine</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Adult residents aged 18 or older living in Ukraine who  were either employed or unemployed and looking for work at the time of the survey.</universe>                      <dataKind>Survey</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The sample was drawn by Valeri Khmelko, Leonid Finkel, and  Vladimir Paniotto, using a method that they designed to overcome the  limitations of past procedures for selecting samples in the former  Soviet Union and the poor quality of official statistics in Ukraine.  Their method is based on multi-stage random sampling: the first stage  being to sample several hundred districts, then to successively sample  post offices, streets, buildings, and apartments, and finally adult  residents (aged 18 or older) living in the selected apartments. The  follow-up survey was conducted by re-interviewing all those  respondents in the original survey who at the time of that survey had been employed or unemployed and looking for work.          </sampProc>                                                    <collMode>face-to-face interview</collMode>                           </dataColl>       <notes>                 Users should refer to SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND PERSONALITY  UNDER CONDITIONS OF RADICAL SOCIAL CHANGE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF  POLAND (1992) AND THE UKRAINE (1992-1993) [ICPSR 2362] for more  information on the original data from which the sample has been extracted.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR21662.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
