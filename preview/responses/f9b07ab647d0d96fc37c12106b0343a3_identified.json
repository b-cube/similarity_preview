Instead, the folds that develop are synonymous with the functional organization of the cortex, and form patterns that are remarkably consistent across individuals and even some species. How this happens is not well understood. Although many developmental features and evolutionary adaptations have been proposed as the primary cause of gyrencephaly, it is not evident that gyrification is reducible in this way. In recent years, we have greatly increased our understanding of the multiple factors that influence cortical folding, from the action of genes in health and disease to evolutionary adaptations that characterize distinctions between gyrencephalic and lissencephalic cortices. Nonetheless it is unclear how these factors which influence events at a small-scale synthesize to form the consistent and biologically meaningful large-scale features of sulci and gyri. In this article, we review the empirical evidence which suggests that gyrification is the product of a generalized mechanism, namely the differential expansion of the cortex. By considering the implications of this model, we demonstrate that it is possible to link the fundamental biological components of the cortex to its large-scale pattern-specific morphology and functional organization.

V.; Heinrichs, M.; Chakrabarti, B.; Sule, A.; Deakin, J. B.; Bethlehem, R. A. I.; Dickens, L.; Mooney, N.; Sipple, J. A. N.; Thiemann, P.; Baron-Cohen, S. Autism spectrum conditions (autism) affect ~1% of the population and are characterized by deficits in social communication.&#13; Oxytocin has been widely reported to affect social-communicative function and its neural underpinnings. Here we report the first&#13; evidence that intranasal oxytocin administration improves a core problem that individuals with autism have in using eye contact&#13; appropriately in real-world social settings. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design is used to&#13; examine how intranasal administration of 24 IU of oxytocin affects gaze behavior for 32 adult males with autism and 34 controls in a&#13; real-time interaction with a researcher. This interactive paradigm bypasses many of the limitations encountered with conventional&#13; static or computer-based stimuli. Eye movements are recorded using eye tracking, providing an objective measurement of looking&#13; patterns. The measure is shown to be sensitive to the reduced eye contact commonly reported in autism, with the autism group&#13; spending less time looking to the eye region of the face than controls. Oxytocin administration selectively enhanced gaze to the&#13; eyes in both the autism and control groups (transformed mean eye-fixation difference per second = 0.082; 95% CI:0.025\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.14,&#13; P = 0.006). Within the autism group, oxytocin has the most effect on fixation duration in individuals with impaired levels of eye&#13; contact at baseline (Cohen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds d = 0.86). These findings demonstrate that the potential benefits of oxytocin in autism extend to a realtime&#13; interaction, providing evidence of a therapeutic effect in a key aspect of social communication.

Words are differentially represented in the brain according to their semantic category and these difficulties in ASC predict reduced activation to emotion-related words in limbic structures crucial for affective processing. Semantic theories view \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdemotion actions\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd as critical for learning the semantic relationship between a word and the emotion it describes, such that emotion words typically activate the cortical motor systems involved in expressing emotion actions such as facial expressions. As ASC are also characterised by motor deficits and atypical brain structure and function in these regions, motor structures would also be expected to show reduced activation during emotion-semantic processing. Here we used event-related fMRI to compare passive processing of emotion words in comparison to abstract verbs and animal names in typically-developing controls and individuals with ASC. Relatively reduced brain activation in ASC for emotionwords, but notmatched controlwords,was found inmotor areas and cingulate cortex specifically. The degree of activation evoked by emotion words in the motor systemwas also associated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the AutismSpectrum Quotient. We suggest that hypoactivation of motor and limbic regions for emotion word processing may underlie difficulties in processing emotional language in ASC. The role that sensorimotor systems and their connections might play in the affective and social-communication difficulties in ASC is discussed.

As well as reviewing the central ideas and concluding that the existing evidence base is broadly supportive of the model, they provide a detailed critique of some of the experiments that we have performed to study it. Though they conclude that the shortcomings that they identify in these experiments do not fundamentally challenge the prediction error model, we nevertheless respond to these criticisms. We begin by providing a more detailed outline of the model itself as there are certain important aspects of it that were not covered in their review. We then respond to their specific criticisms of the empirical evidence. We defend the neuroimaging contrasts that we used to explore this model of psychosis arguing that, while any single contrast entails some ambiguity, our assumptions have been justified by our extensive background work before and since.
