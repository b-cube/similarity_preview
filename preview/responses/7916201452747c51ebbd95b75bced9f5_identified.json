It is an undergraduate e-journal which provides a platform for the work of the Social Anthropology students of the University of St Andrews. The e-journal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds main aim is that of publishing research projects conducted by students in their second year of study. Additionally, the publication promotes visual and other experimental expressions of ethnographic interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The e-journal is intended to present the work of the University of St Andrews\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd undergraduate Social Anthropology students for two main audiences. In the first instance, Ethnographic Encounters presents a valuable resource for future students to draw on the experience and insights of their predecessors. In the second instance, Ethnographic Encounters offers a means for Social Anthropology students throughout the world to engage with their peers in St Andrews, establish new connections, share ideas and to begin to engage in an exchange of knowledge that is fundamental to the discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our newest section, &#039;Inspired by Ethnographic Encounters&#039;, aims to give students the opportunity to publish their work without restricting them to only submitting second-year ethnographic projects. Our goal in doing this is to create a space where we can reflect on the creative aspects of Social Anthropology in St Andrews, as well as to broaden the subject areas included in the journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential contributors are warmly invited to contact us at encounters@st-andrews.ac.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id=&quot;_mcePaste&quot; class=&quot;mcePaste&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0cm;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;Ethnographic Encounters is an undergraduate e-journal which provides a platform for the work of the social anthropology students of University of St Andrews.
