Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the economy, the presidency, the armed forces, and foreign policy, as well as their opinions of Senator Bob Dole, First Lady Hillary Clinton, and Congress. Attitudes were also solicited regarding the 1996 presidential and congressional elections, the media's treatment of Hillary Clinton, and the greatest achievement and disappointment of the Clinton administration. Questions specifically related to President Clinton queried respondents for their views on his honesty and integrity, economic policy, health insurance reform plans, welfare reform policy, and goals for reducing crime, improving the environment, and reducing the budget deficit, as well as whether he had kept his 1992 campaign promises. President Clinton's foreign policy record was addressed, including his handling of the situation in Bosnia, foreign relations with Russia and Israel, potential handling of international crises, and his ability to command international respect. Other topics covered the Whitewater investigations, 1993 White House FBI file requests, the role of the United States military in maintaining world order, and the role of Hillary Clinton in public policy decision-making processes. Respondents were also asked to identify who was responsible for health care reform, protection of the environment, the war on illegal drugs, crime reduction, welfare reform, minimum wage reform, and the reduction of the federal deficit. Background information on respondents includes age, race, sex, ethnicity, education, religion, family income, political party, political orientation, voter registration and participation history, age of children in household, and labor union membership.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1996-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-06</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1996-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-06</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                            </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>           <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
