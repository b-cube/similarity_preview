Following B\\ufffd\\ufffdjar &amp; Rezac (2009) and \\ufffd\\ufffd. Kiss (2013), I suggest that Cyclic Agree gives rise to an Inverse Agreement system in Hungarian, in which the verb shows intransitive agreement in cases where the object has equally or more highly specified features than the subject. The appearance of the second person agreement suffix only with first person but not third subjects is given a principled syntactic explanation. All personal pronouns are argued to trigger agreement in person and number, with some instances, namely inverse ones, not spelled out due to the interaction of Cyclic Agree and the feature specifications of Hungarian personal pronouns.

Implicit learning refers to the phenomenon of learning without intending to learn or awareness that one is learning at all. Semantic preference (or selectional preference \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd as preferred in computational linguistics) is the tendency of a word to co-occur with words sharing similar semantic features. For example, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddrink\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is typically followed by nouns denoting LIQUID, and the verb \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdchase\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is typically followed by ANIMATE nouns. The material presented here spans across disciplines. It examines a well-documented psychological phenomenon - implicit learning \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and applies it in the context of language acquisition, thereby providing insights into both fields. The organisation of this dissertation groups its experiments by their methodology. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the current psychological and linguistic literature. Chapter 2 includes a pen-and-paper study carried out in a classroom environment on Polish learners of English, where awareness is assessed by subjective measures taken at each test question as well as a post-experiment questionnaire. Chapter 3 includes a collection of 5 computer-based experiments based on a false-memory paradigm. After exposure to sentential contexts containing novel verbs, participants are shown to endorse more previously unseen verb-noun pairings that follow the correct semantic preference patterns to the pairings that violate it. The result holds even when participants do not reveal any explicit knowledge of the patterns in the final debriefing. Awareness is additionally assessed using indirect measures examining correlations of confidence judgements with performance. Chapter 4 examines whether implicit learning of novel verb semantic preference patterns is automatic. To this end, a reaction time procedure is developed based on two consecutive decisions (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddouble decision priming\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). The method reveals that semantic implicit learning, at least in the described cases, exerts its influence with a delay, in post-processing. Chapter 5 comprises research done in collaboration with Dr Nitin Williams, University of Reading. It documents an attempt at finding neural indices of implicit learning using a novel single-trial analysis of an electroencephalographic (EEG) signal, based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) denoising. Chapter 6 presents a final discussion and indications for future research. The main contribution of this dissertation to the general field of implicit learning research consists in its challenging the predominant view that implicit learning mainly relies on similarity of forms presented in training and test. The experiments presented here require participants to make generalisations at a higher, semantic level, which is largely independent&#13; of perceptual form. The contribution of this work to the field of Second Language Acquisition consists of empirical support for the currently popular but seldom tested assumptions held by advocates of communicative approaches to language teaching, namely that certain aspects of linguistic knowledge can develop without explicit instruction and explanation. At the same time, it challenges any view assuming that vocabulary learning necessarily relies on explicit mediation. The experiments collected here demonstrate that at least word usage in context can be learnt implicitly. A further contribution of this dissertation is its demonstration that the native language may play a key role in determining what is learnt in such situations. A deeper understanding of the phenomenon of semantic implicit learning promises to shed light on the nature of word and grammar learning in general, which is crucial for an account of the processes involved in the development of a second language mental lexicon. </summary> <dc:date>2013-04-16T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>The emergence of group stress in medieval French</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/243900\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Rainsford, Thomas Michael</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/243900</id> <updated>2013-07-25T12:19:50Z</updated> <published>2011-05-03T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The emergence of group stress in medieval French Rainsford, Thomas Michael The thesis investigates the development of the group-stress system in French&#13; from the earliest textual records to 1500. Empirical work is based on a corpus&#13; compiled especially for the study, which comprises 87 extracts from medieval&#13; French texts totalling over 250,000 words, composed mainly of verse texts to&#13; make use of the extra phonological information provided by the form. A unique&#13; metrical and syntactic annotation is used in the corpus to permit studies of&#13; phonological phrasing and stress placement in lines of verse.&#13; Much octosyllabic narrative verse, in particular texts associated with oral&#13; performance, is shown to have an iambic rhythmic tendency in the pre-1250&#13; period, which is particularly strong in the earliest texts. No such effect is&#13; found in lyric texts or plays, or in narrative from after 1250. Additionally, a&#13; phonological phrase boundary is commonly found in the middle of the line.&#13; Iambic rhythmic organization is argued to be incompatible with group stress&#13; and associated \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdstress deafness\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd effects observed in modern French. From this&#13; data, group stress is argued to have developed between the mid-12th and mid-&#13; 13th centuries.&#13; Work on modern French (e.g. Post, 2000) suggests that the stress group&#13; is the phonological phrase. Through reconstruction of the phonological phrasing&#13; of medieval French, the thesis demonstrates that regular word-final stress,&#13; the phonological phrase internal process of stress clash resolution, and the frequency&#13; of monosyllabic words combine to favour reanalysis of the French stress&#13; system in the pre-1250 period. Finally, the hypothesis that prosodic change affected&#13; verb-second word order in medieval French is reconsidered. It is argued&#13; that light clause-initial constituents which do not form their own phonological&#13; phrase (i.e. short adverbs, subject pronouns) become unstressed, a development&#13; which triggers syntactic changes that lead to the introduction of non&#13; verb-second word orders. </summary> <dc:date>2011-05-03T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
