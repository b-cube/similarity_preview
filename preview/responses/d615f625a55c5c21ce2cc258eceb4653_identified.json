Vitamin D deficiency is also increasing in prevalence, and there is emerging evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to impaired \\ufffd\\ufffd-cell function, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance, all of which are central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Song &amp; Manson, 2010). Following NHS and University ethical approval Welsh domiciled participants (n = 116) with varying levels of glucose control attended the Department of Sport and Exercise laboratory three times over a twelve-month period to examine the relationship between vitamin D and glucose homeostasis. Significant associations were observed between 25(OH)D and measures of glycaemia, and a seasonal variation was observed in 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in this Welsh population (summer 71.3 \\ufffd\\ufffd 23.8; winter 42.6 \\ufffd\\ufffd 23.8 nmol/l). Participants with normal glucose control (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd6 mmol/l) had significantly (U = 884.00, p = 0.03) higher 25(OH)D concentrations than those with abnormal glucose control (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 6.1 mmol/l). A randomised control trial failed to find an effect of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/day) and a fifteen-week cycling programme on measures of glycaemia and body composition in 36 healthy participants. There was a significant (23%) increase in vitamin D status in participants in the supplementation groups demonstrating the effectiveness of the dose administered. Combined with the body of evidence in this area (Pittas et al., 2007) the findings from this thesis provide some support for the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in the management and prevention of type 2 diabetes. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26275\"> <title>MEPs, Parties, and discipline : a critique of the 'Partisan Control Thesis'</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26275</link> <description>MEPs, Parties, and discipline : a critique of the 'Partisan Control Thesis' Dafydd, Einion A Summary of the Thesis&#13; This thesis presents a critique of the partisan control thesis, a common claim in the&#13; academic literature on the European Parliament that two partisan actors \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd domestic&#13; political parties and the European parliamentary groups (EP Groups) \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd influence how&#13; Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) approach representation. Specifically, it&#13; investigates whether domestic parties and EP Groups shape how MEPs think about&#13; and carry out representation, and what factors are linked to variation in the degree to&#13; which these partisan actors seek and achieve influence.&#13; Adopting a mixed-methods research design, this thesis analyses data from the&#13; 2010 EPRG survey of MEPs, and a body of original data gathered by conducting&#13; interviews with MEPs and officials. Three parties from Finland \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd KOK, the SDP, the&#13; PS \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and three from the UK \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the Conservatives, Labour, and UKIP \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are selected as&#13; case studies. The MEPs examined are affiliated to one of four EP Groups, namely the&#13; EPP, the S&amp;D, the ECR, and the EFD. This thesis finds that neither domestic political&#13; parties nor EP Groups exercise the degree of influence that the partisan control thesis&#13; suggests. Furthermore, it identifies that three factors are linked to the propensity of&#13; national parties to attempt to influence MEPs, and that a further three factors&#13; determine the desire and ability of EP Groups to influence MEPs.&#13; This thesis argues that although it is beneficial that MEPs are given the&#13; freedom by their parties to carry out their work according to their own judgment, the&#13; low levels of attention domestic parties pay to the activities of MEPs gives rise to&#13; concerns regarding the existence of an \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdaccountability deficit\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the EU. The&#13; pessimistic conclusion is that this deficit is unlikely to be addressed unless parties&#13; come to place greater value on goals that lie within the context of the EU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds political&#13; system. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26274\"> <title>The European Union\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Human Rights Promotion to Turkey: A Question of Legitimacy</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26274</link> <description>The European Union\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Human Rights Promotion to Turkey: A Question of Legitimacy Gkouti, Athina Summary&#13; Scholars have regularly presented the EU as a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnormative power\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that&#13; promotes human rights as a legitimate standard of international behaviour. Yet, the&#13; legitimacy of EU normative power within enlargement has not been well-defined or&#13; investigated. The overarching issue that this thesis aims to address concerns the&#13; legitimacy of EU human rights promotion to Turkey. It aims to provide an answer&#13; to a politically and intellectually challenging question: How should the European&#13; Union promote human rights to Turkey, if the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds human rights progress is to&#13; be understood not simply as a result of domestic dynamics, but as dependent on the&#13; legitimacy of EU human rights promotion? The central aim of the thesis is to&#13; explore ideas and practices that contribute to improving the EU policy of human&#13; rights towards its non-European partners. The theoretical focus offers a fresh&#13; perspective to the study of Turkey-EU relations that relates to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnormative power&#13; Europe\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and the legitimacy of human rights promotion. The empirical focus of the&#13; thesis explores legitimacy as being a highly significant issue which affects the longterm&#13; success or failure of EU human rights policies. It assesses the prospects and&#13; implications of EU policy and determines what is required in terms of external&#13; incitements for optimal outcomes. The original contribution of the thesis lies in its&#13; argument that EU normative power within enlargement is not intrinsic to the EU,&#13; but ought to be recognised as such through its interaction with non-European&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdothers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/14052\"> <title>Is reciprocity a foundation of international law or whether international law creates reciprocity?</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/14052</link> <description>Is reciprocity a foundation of international law or whether international law creates reciprocity? Fard, Shahrad Nasrolahi Summary&#13; The absence of a powerful uniform legal authority, to enforce international law and international agreements, has placed reciprocity in a pivotal position in inter-State relations and the extent to which States rely on reciprocity. This thesis examines the significance of reciprocity and the extent to which reciprocity manifests itself in international law, more specifically is this manifestation a foundation of international law or whether international law creates reciprocity. The present work argues how reciprocity in international law is a multifaceted concept. On the one side it is a principal tool incentivising States away from wrongful acts, and to abide by their obligations; alternatively it is a tool for establishing the right to a reciprocal response. Thus the study sets out to explore how international law shapes the international community\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds interactions and how, in turn, these interactions shape international law.&#13; Considering the important role that the rule of law plays in the context of international law, the thesis aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the rule of law particularly in its relationship with international law. This analysis will provide a useful discussion on the interactions between the rule of law and reciprocity.&#13; The United Nations was established to enhance co-operation amongst the international community with the goal of maintaining international peace and security. This thesis will explore the role of reciprocity in international law on enhancing international commitment and international co-operation. The significance of this lies in reciprocal and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdremedial\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd options in international law that maintain States\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd commitment to international obligations which in turn develops friendly relations and international co-operation.&#13; This thesis will aim to contribute to scholarly works to bridge the existing gap in interdisciplinary studies exploring the connection between reciprocity, co-operation and the rule of law in the realm of international law. </description> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
