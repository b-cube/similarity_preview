Decrees were passed by a vote of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, or both. Laws came into being by a more complicated process. Laws took precedence over Decrees. Anyone who proposed a decree in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> that contradicted an existing law was subject to prosecution on a charge of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@paranomon\"><soCalled>Illegal Proposal</soCalled></xref> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">grafh\\\\ parano/mwn</foreign>). Laws were passed through a process called <title>nomothesia</title> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">nomoqesi/a</foreign>) or <soCalled>legislation.</soCalled> Each year the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> met to discuss the current body of laws. Any citizen could propose a change in the laws, but could only propose the repeal of a law if he suggested another law to replace the repealed law. If the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> decided to change the laws, a board of <term>Nomothetai</term> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">nomoqe/tai</foreign>) or <soCalled>legislators</soCalled> was selected to review and revise the laws. The process of legislation was like a trial, with advocates speaking in defense of the existing laws, and others speaking against the existing laws. The Nomothetai would vote on changes, and any changes that passed were published on inscriptions near the statues of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Eponymous Heroes\">Eponymous Heroes</xref> and read aloud at the next meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>. The Nomothetai also undertook an annual review of all existing laws, to make sure that none contradicted others, and that none were redundant.</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"Terms\" n=\"Terms\"> <head>Terms</head>  <p>To understand legislation under the Athenian democracy, it is necessary to understand some terms. The Athenians of the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-400\">5th century BCE</dateRange> seem to have used two words interchangeably to refer to what we call a <soCalled>law,</soCalled> <term>nomos</term> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">no/mos</foreign>) and <term>psephisma</term> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">yh/fisma</foreign>). In the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange> these words had two distinct meanings: a <term>nomos</term> was a <soCalled>law,</soCalled> while a <term>psephisma</term> was a <soCalled>decree.</soCalled> For the <dateRange from=\"-499\" to=\"-400\">5th century</dateRange> usage, we have the historian <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Xenophon</name> and his his account of a speech that <name type=\"person\">Euryptolemus</name> gave before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> in <date value=\"-406\">406</date> (Source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\" n=\"OHCW\"><title>OHCW</title></bibl>). The speaker tells his audience that, in a particular case, either the <term>psephisma</term> of <name type=\"person\">Kannonus</name> applies (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.20\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.20</bibl>), or the <term>psephisma</term> regarding temple-robbers and traitors (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.21\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.21</bibl>); he then refers to both of these <term>psephismata</term> as <quote><term>nomoi</term></quote> (the plural form of <term>nomos</term>) (<bibl author=\"Xenophon\" work=\"Xen. Hell.\" n=\"Xen. Hell. 1.7.22\">Xen. <title>Hell.</title> 1.7.22</bibl>). So it would seem that these two terms were more-or-less equivalent. In the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange>, however, these two terms clearly refered to two different things: <term>nomoi</term> were laws enacted through a special process of legislation, while <term>psephismata</term> were decrees passed by a vote of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>. The orator <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name> in one of his speeches asks, rhetorically, why the <soCalled>laws</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">no/moi</foreign>) are good, but the <soCalled>decrees</soCalled> of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">yh/fismata</foreign>) are bad (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.177\">Aeschin. 1.177</bibl>). The philosopher <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> makes a theoretical distinction between <soCalled>laws</soCalled> and <soCalled>decrees,</soCalled> noting that in certain kinds of democracy the laws rule, but in other kinds of democracies decrees can override laws (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Pol. 1292a\">Aristot. <title>Pol.</title> 1292a</bibl>). <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> was the former kind of democracy, according to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, who quotes a principle of Athenian governance, that <quote>No decree, either of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> or the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> shall have more authority than a law</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">yh/fisma de\\\\ mhde\\  mh/te boulh=s mh/te dh/mou no/mou kuriw/teron ei)=nai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.87\">Dem. 23.87</bibl>).</p>  <p>On the other hand, the laws could determine what sorts of decrees the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> could pass, such as a law that allows the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> to pass a decree honoring a citizen, but that limits the circumstances of such an honor (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.36\">Aeschin. 3.36</bibl>). The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">courts</xref> could nullify a decree, based on the laws (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.96\">Dem. 23.96</bibl>). When inscribed on stone for the permanent record, decrees begin with the formula, <quote>it was decided by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref>,</quote> or, <quote>It was decided by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref></quote> (<bibl n=\"IG II2 206 4-5\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 206 4-5</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG II2 206 28-30\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 206 28-30</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG II2 237.5\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 237.5</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG II2 237 31\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 237 31</bibl>); a law began with the formula, <quote>It was decided by the Nomothetae</quote> (<bibl n=\"SEG 12 87.607\"><title>SEG</title> 12 87.607</bibl>).</p>  <p>The Athenians had no formal consitution such as the United States has, a body of laws that fundamentally define the state. Some laws, however, included additional clauses that made it very difficult to change or revoke the law. One such clause is quoted at <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.62\">Dem. 23.62</bibl>: <quote>Whosoever, whether magistrate or private citizen, shall cause this ordinance to be frustrated, or shall alter the same, shall be disfranchised with his children and his property</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.62\">Dem. 23.62</bibl>; see also <bibl n=\"IG II2 43.51-63 = Tod 123\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 43.51-63 = Tod 123</bibl>).</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"WrittenvUnwritten\" n=\"WrittenvUnwritten\"> <head>Written vs. Unwritten Laws</head>  <p>A law included as a quotation in a speech by the orator <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Andocides</name> says, <quote>In no circumstances shall magistrates enforce a law which has not been inscribed. No decree, whether of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> or <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, shall override a law. No law shall be directed against an individual without applying to all citizens alike, unless an <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> of six thousand so resolve by secret ballot</quote> (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.87\">Andoc. 1.87</bibl>). This establishes three important principles of Athenian legislation: (in order from last to first) that except under very special circumstances, the laws of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> were to apply to all citizens equally; that the laws (<foreign lang=\"grc\">no/moi</foreign>) had more authority than the decrees (<foreign lang=\"grc\">psh/fismata</foreign>) of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> or <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>; and finally that only the written laws were valid.</p>  <p>According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Plutarch</name>, when <name type=\"person\">Solon</name> revised the laws of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> in the <dateRange from=\"-599\" to=\"-500\">6th century BCE</dateRange>, he wrote the new laws on wooden tablets (<foreign lang=\"grc\">ei)s culi/nous a)/conas</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Plutarch\" work=\"Plut. Sol.\" n=\"Plut. Sol. 25.1\">Plut. <title>Sol.</title> 25.1</bibl>). By inscribing laws, either on wood or in stone, and setting them in a public place, knowledge of the laws was made available to all citizens rather than to a small elite. As <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> says, <quote>all the citizens have the same laws before them, simple to read and to understand</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">pa=sin h)=| tau)/t' a)nagnw=nai kai\\\\ maqei=n a(pla= kai\\\\ safh= ta\\\\ di/kaia</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.93\">Dem. 20.93</bibl>).</p>   <p>Knowledge of the laws was important, since juries in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">Peoples&#8217; Court</xref> were made up from the citizens in general. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> reminds the jurors sitting in judgement on one occasion, <quote>You have sworn to give a verdict according to the laws, and to the decrees of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> and of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council of Five Hundred</xref></quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 19\" n=\"Dem. 19.179\">Dem. 19.179</bibl>; note that he mentions the laws before the decrees).</p>  <p>But elsewhere, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> reminds Athenian jurors that the laws cannot cover every eventuality: <quote>Again, men of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, you must also consider well and carefully the fact that you have come into court today, sworn to give your verdict according to the laws&#8230; and where there are no statutes to guide you, you are sworn to decide according to the best of your judgement</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.118\">Dem. 20.118</bibl>). So in the absence of clear laws, jurors were free to vote according to unwritten laws, or their own understanding of justice (or their own prejudices).</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"History\" n=\"History\"> <head>A History of Legislation in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> in the <dateRange from=\"-425\" to=\"-375\">late 5th and early 4th centuries BCE</dateRange></head>  <p>In <date value=\"-411\">411</date> BCE, a group of Athenians overturned the democracy and installed an oligarchic government; during this crisis, both the oligarchs and the democrats claimed to be supporting the <soCalled>ancestral constitution</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s patri/ous no/mous</foreign>), the laws established in the <dateRange from=\"-599\" to=\"-500\">6th century</dateRange> by <name type=\"person\">Solon</name>, and after him, those by <name type=\"person\">Cleisthenes</name> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

The next year, <date value=\"-410\">410</date> BCE, when the oligarchy was overthrown, the restored democratic government immediately set up a body of <soCalled>Law Publishers</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">a)nagrafei=s tw=n no/mwn</foreign>) to publish all of the laws, especially those of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name> and <name type=\"person\">Solon</name> (<bibl n=\"IG I3 104.5-6\"><title>IG</title> I<edition>3</edition> 104.5-6</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.2\">Lys. 30.2</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.25\">Lys. 30.25</bibl>; source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\" n=\"Hansen, Athenian Democracy, 162-3\">Hansen, <title>Athenian Democracy</title>, 162-3</bibl>). That this was one of the first actions of the newly restored democracy suggests the importance Athenians placed on public knowledge of the laws. <name type=\"person\">Nicomachus</name> was in charge of this board, as <soCalled>Commissioner of Laws</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tw=n no/mwn a)nagrafeu\\\\s</foreign>), and was originally supposed to complete publication in four months (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.2\">Lys. 30.2</bibl>). The board spent six years, however, compiling and publishing <name type=\"person\">Solon</name>&#8217;s body of laws (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.2-3\">Lys. 30.2-3</bibl>). The published laws, which included the homicide law of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name> and laws regarding the powers of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> (<bibl n=\"M&#38;L 86\">M&#38;L 86</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG I3 105\"><title>IG</title> I<edition>3</edition> 105</bibl>) were inscribed on the wall of the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Stoa Basileios, Athens\">Stoa Basileios</name> in the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Agora, Athens\">Agora</name> (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.2-3\">Lys. 30.2-3</bibl>).</p>  <p>In <date value=\"-404\">404</date> BCE, when <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> surrended to <placeName key=\"Sparta\">Sparta</placeName>, the government of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref>, imposed on <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> by the Spartans, removed these published laws from the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Stoa Basileios, Athens\">Stoa Basileios</name> (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.2-3\">Lys. 30.2-3</bibl>). <name type=\"person\">Nicomachus</name>, the head of the <soCalled>Law Publishers</soCalled> was later put on trial, accused of manipulating the laws he published and helping the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref> consolidate their power (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.1-3\">Lys. 30.1-3</bibl>).</p>  <p>Like the Oligarchy of <date value=\"-411\">411</date>, the tyranny of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Thirty Tyrants\">Thirty</xref> lasted only one year, and after it was overthrown and the city returned to democratic rule, <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> once again compiled and codified its old laws: <quote>On the motion of <name type=\"person\">Teisamenos</name> the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> decreed that <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> be governed as of old, in accordance with the laws of <name type=\"person\">Solon</name>, his weights and his measures, and in accordance with the statutes of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name>, which we used in times past. Such further laws as may be necessary shall be inscribed upon tables by the Nomothetae elected by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and named hereafter, exposed before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Eponymous Heroes\">Tribal Statues</xref> for all to see, and handed over to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">magistrates</xref> during the present month. The laws thus handed over, however, shall be submitted beforehand to the scrutiny of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and the five hundred Nomothetae elected by the Demes, when they have taken their oath. Further, any private citizen who so desires may come before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and suggest improvements in the laws. When the laws have been ratified, they shall be placed under the guardianship of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref>, to the end that only such laws as have been ratified may be applied by magistrates. Those laws which are approved shall be inscribed upon the wall, where they were inscribed aforetime, for all to see</quote> (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.83-84\">Andoc. 1.83-84</bibl>).</p>  <p>To affirm a principle of democratic rule, <name type=\"person\">Teisamenos</name>&#8217; decree was followed by another law that said, <quote>In no circumstance shall magistrates enforce a law which has not been inscribed <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" type=\"reference\">that is, written down and published in a public place</note></quote> (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.85\">Andoc. 1.85</bibl>).</p>  <p>After inscribing the old laws of <name type=\"person\">Solon</name> and <name type=\"person\">Draco</name>, which Andocides says were to be used temporarily while the democracy codified new laws (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.81\">Andoc. 1.81</bibl>), the Athenians appointed a board of <soCalled>law givers</soCalled> or <term>nomothetae</term> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">nomoqe/tai</foreign>) to conduct a <soCalled>scrutiny</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">dokimasi/a</foreign>) of all the laws, in other words, to examine the laws and vote on whether each law should remain in effect (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.84\">Andoc. 1.84</bibl>). According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Andocides</name>, this revision of the laws happened quickly (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.85\">Andoc. 1.85</bibl>). The nomothetae dealt with the laws of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name> and <name type=\"person\">Solon</name>, and to other laws as well (<bibl author=\"Andocides\" work=\"Andoc. 1\" n=\"Andoc. 1.96-98\">Andoc. 1.96-98</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.42\">Dem. 24.42</bibl>), including a codification of all the sacrifices that <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> had to carry out during the course of a year (<bibl author=\"Lysias\" work=\"Lys. 30\" n=\"Lys. 30.17\">Lys. 30.17</bibl>).</p>  <p>Even after this revision, Athenians continued to refer to the <soCalled>laws of <name type=\"person\">Draco</name> and <name type=\"person\">Solon</name></soCalled> (see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.51\">Dem. 23.51</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.42\">Dem. 24.42</bibl>). It does seem that in the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange> homicide was still governed by <name type=\"person\">Draco</name>&#8217;s homicide law (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.37\">Dem. 23.37</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 43\" n=\"Dem. 43.57\">Dem. 43.57</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG I3 104\"><title>IG</title> I<edition>3</edition> 104</bibl>), and the laws of inheritance were closely based on Solon&#8217;s laws (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 44\" n=\"Dem. 44.67-68\">Dem. 44.67-68</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Apollodorus\" work=\"Dem. 46\" n=\"Dem. 46.14\">Dem. 46.14</bibl>).</p>  <p>After <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Andocides</name>, there is no <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange> reference to laws being published at the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Stoa Basileios, Athens\">Stoa Basileios</name>; orators mention laws published on pillars (<foreign lang=\"grc\">sth=lai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Apollodorus\" work=\"Dem. 59\" n=\"Dem. 59.75-76\">Dem. 59.75-76</bibl>) or in the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Metroon, Athens\">Metroon</name> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 25\" n=\"Dem. 25.99\">Dem. 25.99</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Lycurgus\" work=\"Lyc. 1\" n=\"Lyc. 1.66\">Lyc. 1.66</bibl>). Mogens Hansen suggests that in the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange> there were simply too many laws to put them all on stone, so they were written on papyrus and kept in the public archives at the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Metroon, Athens\">Metroon</name> (<bibl primary=\"NO\" n=\"Hansen, Athenian Democracy, 164-165\">Hansen, <title>Athenian Democracy</title>, 164-165</bibl>).</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"Nomothetae\" n=\"Nomothetae\"> <head>The Process of Making Laws: the Nomothetae</head>  <p>The procedures for making new laws or revising existing laws was complicated, and seems to have been intended to make the process as democratic as possible, and to prevent any hasty or poorly considered changes to the laws.</p>  <p>When the Athenian democracy published a law (<foreign lang=\"grc\">no/mos</foreign>), as opposed to a decree (<foreign lang=\"grc\">yh/fisma</foreign>), the text of the law began with the formula: <quote>It was decided by the nomothetae</quote> (<bibl n=\"SEG 12 87.6-7\"><title>SEG</title> 12 87.6-7</bibl>; decrees began with the formula, <quote>It was decided by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref>,</quote> or, <quote>It was decided by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref>,</quote> <bibl n=\"IG II2 206 4-5\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 206 4-5</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG II2 206 28-30\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 206 28-30</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG II2 237.5\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 237.5</bibl>; <bibl n=\"IG II2 237 31\"><title>IG</title> II<edition>2</edition> 237 31</bibl>).</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> describes process of legislation in detail, in his speech prosecuting <name type=\"person\">Timocrates</name> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24\">Dem. 24</bibl>). He reminds the jurors that, <quote>In our laws at present in force, men of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, every condition that must be observed when new statutes are to be enacted is laid down clearly and with precision. First of all, there is a prescribed time for legislation; but even at the proper time a man is not permitted to propose his law just as he pleases.

Then it is ordained that the law must be of universal application, and also that laws of contrary purpose must be repealed; and there are other directions with which I do not think I need trouble you now</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.17-18\">Dem. 24.17-18</bibl>).</p>  <p>While any citizen could suggest changes to the laws, laws were not passed by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> or the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, as decrees were, but were passed by a rather prolonged process involving the <soCalled>Law givers,</soCalled> the nomothetae (<foreign lang=\"grc\">nomoqe/tai</foreign>; the singular form is <foreign lang=\"grc\">nomoqeth/s</foreign>). Panels of Nomothetae were formed for the purposes of creating new laws and reviewing existing laws; the Nomothetae were drawn from Athenians who had sworn the <soCalled>dikastic oath,</soCalled> the oath that jurors swore before entering a courtroom (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl>; a passage in <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.149-151\">Dem. 24.149-151</bibl>, purports to be the text of that oath). So these Nomothetae were ordinary citizens assigned the task of creating and revising the laws.</p>  <p>These Nomothetae would get together and conduct legislation under three circumstances: if the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> called for revisions to the laws, if an individual Athenian proposed a change in the laws, and if the six <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Archons</xref> called the Thesmothetae (<foreign lang=\"grc\">qesmoqe/tai</foreign>; see <bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot.

This is how <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> describes the process:</p>  <p><quote>In the first presidency and on the eleventh day thereof, in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, the Herald having read prayers, a vote shall be taken on the laws, to wit, first upon laws respecting the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, and secondly upon general statutes, and then upon statutes enacted for the nine <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Archons</xref>, and then upon laws affecting other authorities. Those who are content with the laws respecting the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> shall hold up their hands first, and then those who are not content; and in like manner in respect of general statutes. All voting upon laws shall be in accordance with laws already in force</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.20\">Dem. 24.20</bibl>).</p>  <p>This passage tells us several things. First, it suggests that the laws of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> were divided into several categories. There were laws concerning the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">peri\\\\ tw=n bouleutikw=n</foreign>); this presumably included laws governing the Nomothetae and the procedure for legislation itself, since it was the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> that appointed the panels of Nomothetae (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.47-48\">Dem. 24.47-48</bibl>). There were laws <soCalled>common</soCalled> to all Athenians (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tw=n koinw=n</foreign>). There were laws having to do with the nine <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Archons</xref> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">oi(\\\\ kei=ntai toi=s e)nne/a a)/rxousin</foreign>). And there were laws having to do with <soCalled>other authorities</soCalled> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tw=n a)/llwn a)rxw=n</foreign>). This passage also tells us that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> voted on the existing laws by a show of hands (<foreign lang=\"grc\">xeirotoni/a</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.20\">Dem. 24.20</bibl>).</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> continues his description of the annual review: <quote>If any law already in force be rejected on show of hands, the presidents <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" type=\"reference\"><foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s pruta/neis</foreign>, the <soCalled>Prytaneis</soCalled> described in the article on the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref></note> in whose term of office the voting takes place shall appoint the last of the three meetings of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> for the consideration of laws so rejected. The commissioners <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" type=\"reference\"><foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s proe/drous</foreign>, the <soCalled>Proedroi</soCalled></note> who preside by lot at the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> are required, immediately after religious observances, to put the question respecting the sessions of the Nomothetae (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tw=n nomoqetw=n</foreign>), and respecting the fund from which their fees are to be paid. The Nomothetae (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s de\\\\ nomoqe/tas</foreign>) shall consist of persons who have taken the judicial oath</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.21\">Dem. 24.21</bibl>).</p>  <p>So, if the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> voted against any of the current laws, several things happened. First, the Prytaneis (those in charge of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> for that month, who set the agendas for meetings of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>) would set aside the last meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> in that month for discussion of the laws. The Nomothetae, ordinary citizens selected out of those who had sworn the oath that all jurors swore, would conduct the actual process of legislation, but the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> would decide certain details regarding the meetings of the Nomothetae. Specifically, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> would discuss payment for the Nomothetae (mentioned here at <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.21\">Dem. 24.21</bibl>), and how much the Nomothetae should be given to conduct their business (this is mentioned more specifically at <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 21\" n=\"Dem. 21.23\">Dem. 21.23</bibl>).</p>  <p>The Athenians took this process very seriously, as <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> tells us, and specified severe penalties for any official who deviated from the proper procedure: <quote>If the Prytaneis do not convene the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> according to the written regulations, or if the Proedroi do not put the question, each president shall forfeit one thousand drachmas of sacred money to <name type=\"god\">Athene</name>, and each commissioner shall forfeit forty drachmas of sacred money to <name type=\"god\">Athene</name>, and information thereof shall be laid before the Thesmothetae in such manner as when a man holds office being in debt to the treasury; and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Thesmothetae</xref> shall bring before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">Court</xref> according to the law all persons against whom such information is laid; otherwise they shall not be raised to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref>, as obstructing the rectification of the statutes</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.22\">Dem. 24.22</bibl>).</p>  <p>So the punishment for failing to follow the proper procedure was a 1000 drachma fine, and in the case of one of the archons, disqualification from serving on the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Council of the Areopagus</xref> after his term in office.</p>  <p>Before this meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, when the Athenians voted on the existing laws, anyone who wanted to change the laws was supposed to make public specific proposals for new laws: <quote>Before the meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> any Athenian citizen who wishes shall write down the laws proposed by him and exhibit the same in front of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Eponymous Heroes\">Eponymous Heroes</xref>, to the end that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> may vote on the question of the time allowed to the Nomothetae with due regard to the total number of laws proposed. Whosoever proposes a new statute shall write it on a white board and exhibit it in front of the statues of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Eponymous Heroes\">Eponymous Heroes</xref> on every day until the meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref></quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.23\">Dem. 24.23</bibl>).</p>  <p>This must have meant that the vote on the existing laws was equivalent to a vote on the proposed changes. If the citizens liked the suggestions posted beforehand, they could vote against the existing laws, thus starting a process of legislation. If the citizens did not like the posted suggestions, they would vote in favor of the existing laws. Requiring proposed changes before the meeting would allow the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> to make an informed decision regarding how long the Nomothetae should take to conduct their business (see also <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.94\">Dem. 20.94</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.36\">Dem. 24.36</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.39\">Aeschin. 3.39</bibl>).</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> says, elsewhere in his speech against <name type=\"person\">Timocrates</name>, that it was lawful for any citizen to propose changing an existing law, but only if he suggested a new law to take its place (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.33\">Dem. 24.33</bibl>).</p>  <p>The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, at this first meeting of the year (on the 11th day of the month <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Calendar\">Hekatombaion</xref>), would also choose five citizens to <quote>speak in defence of laws proposed for repeal before the Nomothetae</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.23\">Dem. 24.23</bibl>). This suggests that the process of legislation was very much like a trial in a courtroom, with some people <soCalled>prosecuting</soCalled> the existing laws (and advocating new laws), and others defending the existing laws (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.23\">Dem. 24.23</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.36\">Dem. 24.36</bibl>).</p>  <p>After this first meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> for the year, if the voting determined that the laws should be reviewed and possibly changed, there was a delay, presumably to let people consider matters. No further action happened at the next meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> in that month, but at the third meeting, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> decided how long the Nomothetae should spend legislating, and details of their pay (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 21\" n=\"Dem. 21.24\">Dem. 21.24</bibl>).</p>  <p>The Nomothetae were not chosen until the actual day assigned for legislation; on the morning of that day they were chosen by lot from those who had sworn the Heliastic Oath that all <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jurors</xref> swore (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl>). A board of nomothetae could be huge: <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> reports that in <date value=\"-354\">354/3 BCE</date>, <name type=\"person\">Timocrates</name> passed in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> a decree setting up a board of 1001 Nomothetae, and ordering the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> to assist them in their work (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl>; source for date, <bibl primary=\"NO\" n=\"Hansen, Athenian Democracy, 167\">Hansen, <title>Athenian Democracy</title>, 167</bibl>). It should be mentioned, however, that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> attacked this particular motion by <name type=\"person\">Timocrates</name> as being illegal, although not, it seems, for the number of Nomothetae that <name type=\"person\">Timocrates</name> proposed (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24\">Dem. 24</bibl>).</p>  <p>The meeting of the Nomothetae was conducted by Proedroi (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s proe/drous</foreign> mentioned at <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.33\">Dem. 24.33</bibl>).

The meeting was conducted like a trial, with advocates speaking in favor of the existing laws (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s sunapologhsome/nous to\\  dh=mon toi=s no/mois</foreign>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.23\">Dem. 24.23</bibl>), and others speaking in favor of changing the laws (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s sunhgo/rous</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.36\">Dem. 24.36</bibl>). When both parties had spoken, the Nomothetae voted by show of hands (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.33\">Dem. 24.33</bibl>).</p>  <p>Any new laws proposed by the Nomothetae were published near the statues of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Eponymous Heroes\">Eponymous Heroes</xref> and were also read aloud to the next meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.94\">Dem. 20.94</bibl>).</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"OtherWays\" n=\"OtherWays\"> <head>Other Ways of Initiating Legislation</head>  <p>In addition to this regularly scheduled, annual, opportunity for legislation, there were other ways of initiation the process of making changes to the laws of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>. Any citizen could, at any time, propose a change in the laws (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.33\">Dem. 24.33</bibl>). The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Archons</xref>, specifically the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Archons\">Thesmothetae</xref>, were also charged with making an annual review of the existing laws and, if they found contradictory laws or redundant laws, they could arrange for a board of Nomothetae to change the laws (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.38\">Aeschin. 3.38</bibl>).</p>  <p>In the case of an individual citizen who wanted to change the laws, he could not propose repealing a law without suggesting a new law to take its place (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.33\">Dem. 24.33</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.89-94\">Dem. 20.89-94</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.21\">Dem. 24.21</bibl>). The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> would decide whether or not the proposal had sufficient merit to be brought before the Nomothetae (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.21\">Dem. 24.21</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 3\" n=\"Dem. 3.10-13\">Dem. 3.10-13</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.39\">Aeschin. 3.39</bibl>).</p>  <p>The <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> had to be involved, too, because it was the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> that set the agenda for meetings of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>. So once a citizen had posted a proposal for new legislation, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> had to put the issue on the agenda for a meeting of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>; this was done by means of a <term>probouleuma</term> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">probou/leuma</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.48\">Dem. 24.48</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 3\" n=\"Aeschin. 3.39\">Aeschin. 3.39</bibl>). <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl> contains a decree that orders <quote>the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> to cooperate in the legislative process</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">sunnomoqetei=n de\\\\ kai\\\\ th\\  boulh/n</foreign>) in the matter of convening the Nomothetae, which may mean only that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref> was to ensure that the business appeared on the agenda for the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>.

Pol.</title> 41.2</bibl>); since the legislators, the Nomothetae, were chosen from the same pool as potential jurors, and swore the same oaths as jurors (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.27\">Dem. 24.27</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.149-151\">Dem. 24.149-151</bibl>), this comment seems fairly accurate. Whether or not we should see this fact as a bad thing is, of course, a matter of opinion.</p>  <p>We also find Athenians criticizing their city&#8217;s legislation. Both <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Isocrates</name> and <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> complain that <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> passes too many laws and fails to enforce them (<bibl author=\"Isocrates\" work=\"Isoc. 8\" n=\"Isoc. 8.A50\">Isoc. 8.50</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 24\" n=\"Dem. 24.142\">Dem. 24.142</bibl>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> makes another criticism, accusing his fellow Athenians of legislating too frequently and in too much haste; he says that there are too many new laws that invalidate older decrees, but that those decrees are still in force&#8212;a confusing state of affairs (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.91-92\">Dem. 20.91-92</bibl>).</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\"  id=\"Praise\" n=\"Praise\"> <head>Praise for Athenian Legislation</head>  <p>The Athenians do seem to have been, on the whole, proud of the distinction between decrees and laws. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>, for example, asks and answers a rhetorical question pitting the decrees of the <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Assembly</name>, which were easy to pass, against the laws, which were subject to the complex procedures for legislation: <quote>Why do you suppose it is, fellow citizens, that the existing laws are good, but that the decrees of the city are inferior to them, and that the verdicts rendered in the courts are sometimes open to censure? I will explain to you the reason. It is because you enact the laws with no other object than justice, not moved by unrighteous gain, or by either partiality or animosity, looking solely to what is just and for the common good. And because you are, as I think, naturally, more clever than other men, it is not surprising that you pass most excellent laws. But in the meetings of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> and in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">Courts</xref>, you oftentimes lose all hold of the discussion of the matter in hand, and are led away by deceit and trickery</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.177-178\">Aeschin. 1.177-178</bibl>).</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> praises this practice of legislating (<foreign lang=\"grc\">tou\\\\s no/mous tiqe/nai</foreign>) as being open and democratic (<foreign lang=\"grc\">par' u(mi=n, e)n toi=s o)mwmoko/sin, par' oi(=sper kai\\\\ ta)/lla kurou=tai</foreign>), and in helping the average citizen keep track of the laws of the city: <quote>[The Nomothetae undertake their annual review] so that there may be only one law dealing with each subject, and that the plain citizen may not be puzzled by such contradictions and be at a disadvantage compared with those who are acquainted with the whole body of law, but that all may have the same ordinances before them, simple and clear to read and understand</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 20\" n=\"Dem. 20.93\">Dem. 20.93</bibl>).</p>  <p>As for the laws themselves, the products of the complex and carefully designed process of <foreign lang=\"grc\">nomoqesi/a</foreign>, legislation, we find similar praise. The orator <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Lycurgus</name> reminds his listeners that, <quote>The things which in the main uphold our democracy and preserve the city&#8217;s prosperity are three in number: first the system of law, second the vote of the jury, and third the method of prosecution by which the crimes are handed over to them</quote> (<bibl author=\"Lycurgus\" work=\"Lyc. 1\" n=\"Lyc. 1.3-4\">Lyc. 1.3-4</bibl>).</p>  <p>And <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> tells a jury, <quote>I shall say nothing novel or extravagant or peculiar, but only what you all know to be true as well as I do. For if any of you cares to inquire what is the motive-power that calls together the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Council\">Council</xref>, draws the people into the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, fills the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">law-courts</xref>, makes the old <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">archons</xref> resign readily to the new, and enables the whole life of the State to be carried on and preserved, he will find that it is the laws and the obedience that all men yield to the laws; since, if once they were done away with and every man were given licence to do as he liked, not only does the constitution vanish, but our life would not differ from that of the beasts of the field</quote> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 25\" n=\"Dem. 25.20\">Dem. 25.20</bibl>).</p>  <p>The procedures for enforcing the laws are a subject more appropriate to a discussion of the <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref></soCalled>.</p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Bibliography\" n=\"Bibliography\"> <head>Secondary Works Cited</head>  <list rend=\"numbered\">  <item><bibl primary=\"NO\">John Boardman, Jasper Griffin, Oswyn Murray, <title>Oxford History of the Classical World</title> (Oxford, 1986) [<title>OHCW</title>]</bibl>.</item>  <item><bibl primary=\"NO\">J.A.
