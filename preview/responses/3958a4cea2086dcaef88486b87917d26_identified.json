It shows Joshua, the leader of the Israelites who succeeded Moses and  led them in the conquest of Canaan, the Promised Land. The panel  may originally have decorated the screen or gallery of a church or private house. It  is typical of the plainer style of church decoration that prevailed after the Reformation from about 1540 onwards. Narrative scenes with Old Testament figures in contemporary dress replaced saints in classical robes. The surface was no longer embellished with rich gilding and intricate two-dimensional patterns. The purpose of such panels was didactic rather than devotional. Simple images, large text and the use of English rather than Latin made the stories accessible to a wide range of people, many of whom were neither well-educated nor literate. .  Place The panels almost certainly come from the south-west of England. The figures are similar to those on a painted ceiling at Muchelney Abbey and in plasterwork at Montacute House, both in Somerset. The lettering is similar to inscriptions on walls of the Dorset churches of  Puddletown and Cerne Abbas. The panels were purchased in 1914 from a dealer from Lynmouth, Devon, by the name of T. Charbonnier. There was a strong tradition in south-western England in the early 17th century of portraying figures of this kind with associated texts in plasterwork. This panel, one of a group of 25 in the V&amp;A, is a rare surviving example of the tradition executed in paint on panel.  Time From about 1590 stories from the Old Testament supplied popular decorative themes in domestic and church settings in the West Country. Examples include Prideaux Place (1590s -1630s) and Lanydrock (1630s), Cornwall, and the parish church of Widecombe in the Moor, Devon.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>joshua-panel-unknown</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 4, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Unknown</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1604</year_end>              <object_number>O79014</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>Probably painted in the area of Plymouth, Devon  Panels of Old Testament Prophets, purchased from Mr T Charbonnier, The Art Gallery, Lynmouth, N.

The image is made on a brightly polished sheet of silvered copper. This process was initially used almost entirely for commercial portraiture. The photographs here by early amateurs, Horatio Ross and William Edward Kilburn, show a portrait and a fishing scene, prototypes of the ever-popular &#39;family snapshot&#39;. [14/07/06] &lt;b&gt;Object Type&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Daguerreotypes (an early type of photograph on a silvered copper plate) were usually protected by glass and sometimes kept in leather or thick plastic cases because the highly polished surface is easily scratched. The image is a unique positive made directly onto the plate without a negative, as in other forms of photography. Many daguerreotype photographers replaced miniature painters as makers of portraits as the process was quicker and less expensive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;Ownership &amp; Use&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Daguerreotypes were not made primarily for public display in exhibitions. Such small and intimate photographs were generally produced as private keepsakes and often remained within the family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;People&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Horatio Ross (1801-1886) took up photography in 1845, although he is also remembered as one of the 19th century&#39;s finest sportsmen. He was best known for steeplechasing (a form of horse racing) and as a marksman. Ross and his sons represented Scotland in the National Rifle Association championships in 1863.

The son is assisted by a gillie (a Scottish term for an attendant in the sport). It is true that photography made possible new kinds of intimate and casual records of family life. However, this photograph would have been very deliberately staged and posed, because the Daguerreotype process was highly complex to use, especially in the open air. Daguerrotype was the first commercially available form of photography, introduced in 1839. Each photograph was a one-off, appearing on a silvered copper plate.  In fact, Horatio Ross was perhaps the only photographer to use the process to photograph fly-fishing. He himself was one of the greatest sportsmen of his time. When he took up photography as one of the earliest British amateurs he naturally sought to illustrate his favourite pastimes. This example is enhanced by a lucky accident. The relative brightness of the sky, compared to the rest of the scene, has caused \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsolarisation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd - a reversal of white into blue. It looks as if the sky that day was blue and the Daguerreotype medium (which was black and white only) had been able to record it.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>hoddy-and-john-munro-fishing-daguerreotype-ross-horatio</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 21, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Ross, Horatio</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1847</year_end>              <object_number>O82869</object_number>              <credit>Given by Maj.

With the arrival of glassblowing around 50 BC, such items could be made relatively easily and became affordable to people of modest means. The two small loop handles on the neck of this bottle would have held a larger loop handle in bronze which could be used to suspend the bottle or carry it around.  Oils and other unguents were important in Roman society for preparing the bodies of burial or cremation. After use, the containers for such prepatory producs were often deposited alongside the bodies in their graves.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>bottle-unknown</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 29, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Unknown</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>200</year_end>              <object_number>O3699</object_number>              <credit>Salting Collection, Bequethed by George Salting Esq.</credit>              <history_note>Bequeathed to the museum by George Salting</history_note>              <place>Italy</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note>Like many ancient peoples, the Romans believed in an Afterlife that would be an idealized form of their worldly experience. So it was a family obligation to ensure that the grave of every deceased relative was furnished according to its means; not just food and wine, but also offerings of perfume. The wealthy would provide these offerings in flasks (unguentaria) made of silver or alabaster. With the arrival of glassblowing, poorer citizens now could offer similar items in glass.  There was also an extensive market for unguentaria in life as well as death; Roman society was fastidious about personal hygiene and appearance. And during the mid-1st century A.D., as glassworkers continued to adapt their skills, their wares steadily ousted their pottery counterparts from the marketplace. The forms of unguentaria steadily multiplied over the years-in particular, necks often were extended, to slow the evaporation of perfumed oils-as did their decoration, following stylistic trends of the glassworking industry overall.  In the mid 4th century A.D., the establishment of Constantinople as the new administrative heart of the Roman World resulted in many social and economic changes. But the Roman desire for perfumery and cosmetics remained a constant, and each time there was a change in shape among the gold and silver perfume bottles (unguentaria) of the wealthy, it soon was mimicked in glass.</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>CER</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>C.478-1924</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1759</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Mug of soft-paste porcelain painted with underglaze blue, Bow Porcelain Factory, Bow, ca. 1755-58</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>-0.02651000</longitude>              <year_start>1750</year_start>              <id>8924</id>              <date_text>ca. 1755-58 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AM2804</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description>Mug of soft-paste porcelain painted with underglaze blue.

The English porcelain factories made bell-shaped mugs from the 1750s to the 1770s.  Materials &amp; Making The Bow factory, where the mug was made, manufactured a type of porcelain strengthened with ashes from animal bones. The result was a comparatively durable ceramic material, one that was suitable for drinking utensils and other utilitarian wares.  Trading Bow porcelain was sold from a warehouse on the factory site and from London showrooms, but it could also be purchased at auction or from dealers in London and other cities. The factory also sold large quantities to merchants for export to the American colonies and elsewhere. Dragon-patterned blue and white wares are mentioned in the memorandum book of the clerk of one of Bow&#39;s London showrooms in 1756, when they were needed for one of the important London china and glass dealers.  Design The dragon pattern was popular at several English porcelain factories, including Bow, Worcester, Lowestoft, Vauxhall and Liverpool, between the 1750s and the 1770s. The English factories probably originally copied the pattern from an early-18th-century Chinese dish.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>mug-bow-porcelain-factory</slug>              <sys_updated>Oct. 21, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Bow Porcelain Factory</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1759</year_end>              <object_number>O77937</object_number>              <credit>Given by E.

An etching is produced by biting lines in a metal plate with acid to hold ink. The lines on the plate are filled with ink, which is then printed onto paper.  Subject Depicted This print by an unknown engraver was included in John Guillim&#39;s A Display of Heraldrie, a book containing illustrations of coats of arms accompanied by explanatory texts. John Guillim (1565-1621) was an Officer of the College of Arms, the official repository of the coats of arms and pedigrees of English, Welsh, Northern Irish and Commonwealth families and their descendants. A Display of Heraldrie, which brought its author fame, was first published in 1610 and appeared in many editions until 1724. This print comes from a posthumous edition of 1679 dedicated to Charles II and contains &#39;A Treatise of Honour, Military and Civil, by Captain Loggan&#39;.  The print shows King Charles II richly clad in robes of state and holding a military commander&#39;s baton in his right hand. His other hand rests on a shield or crystal globe, behind which is a wreathed Roman standard and a flag bearing the letters SPQR (senatus populusque Romanus - &#39;the senate and people of Rome&#39;). These items symbolise Roman imperial military triumphs and the parading of booty.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>charles-ii-print-unknown</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 21, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Unknown</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1679</year_end>              <object_number>O78212</object_number>              <credit>Given by Edgar Seligman</credit>              <history_note>Probably engraved in London by an unidentified engraver Plate from John Guillim&#39;s &#39;A Display of Heraldrie&#39;, published in 1679</history_note>              <place>London</place>              <production_note>Plate from John Guillim&#39;s &#39;A Display of Heraldrie&#39;, published in 1679</production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>PDP</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>T.310-1920</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1599</date_end>              <descriptive_line>THE JUDGEMENT OF PARIS</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>-1.56707000</longitude>              <year_start>1590</year_start>              <id>9631</id>              <date_text>ca. 1595 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AV2709</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description></physical_description>              <dimensions>Height: 321 cm, Width: 360.5 cm</dimensions>              <title></title>              <date_start>Jan. 1, 1590</date_start>              <materials_techniques>Tapestry-woven in wool and silk; 14 warp threads per inch (5-6 per cm)</materials_techniques>              <last_processed>March 2, 2015, 8:41 p.m.</last_processed>              <label>British Galleries: Tapestries were a vital element in 17th-century interiors and  provided warmth as well as vividly-coloured decoration for walls.

He won the love of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, but this led to the war between the Greeks and the Trojans.

Some tapestries had a decorative design using popular motifs, while others told a story. According to the inscription round the picture, this tapestry depicts a classical theme, its subject Paris giving the Golden Apple. The tale comes from the Epistles of the Latin poet, Ovid.  Manufacture In 1570 William Sheldon, a prosperous Worcestershire gentleman, set up a tapestry workshop in his manor house at Barcheston, now in Warwickshire.  His intention was to provide a remedy for the high local unemployment which, by training tapestry weavers, would also cut down the level of goods imported from Flanders (now part of Belgium) and the Netherlands, the traditional areas of the weaving craft. His head weaver almost certainly came from those regions and was engaged to teach his skills to local Englishmen. Few of the Sheldon tapestries rivalled  the more sophisticated work produced in Flanders and most of the products attributed to the Sheldon looms are relatively modest in size and style. They were therefore within reach of the middle classes of society. Production continued through the lifetime of William\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds son, Ralph, but had almost certainly ceased by 1615.  People and Places The initials HI, seen to the left and right below the central scene, are thought to be those of Henry, son of Walter Jones, first owner of this tapestry. Son of a Witney woollen merchant, Walter went to Oxford University; after a legal training he became Town Clerk of Worcester. He bought Chastleton House (Oxfordshire) from Robert Catesby, a bankrupt Sheldon relative later involved in the Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Jones rebuilt Chastleton, where the tapestry was found, as an imposing Jacobean house, displaying coats of arms not his own in several prominent places. A chimney piece was carved with the Sheldon arms, and, in an inventory of 1633, a bedroom in the house was described as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdMr Sheldon\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds chamber\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The arms, and room, can still be seen; the house is now owned by the National Trust.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>tapestry-sheldon</slug>              <sys_updated>Sept. 4, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Sheldon</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1599</year_end>              <object_number>O78823</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>Made for Walter Jones (born possibly 1550, died in 1632)</history_note>              <place>Warwickshire</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>T&amp;F</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>W.15:1 to 14-1930</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1810</date_end>              <descriptive_line></descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>-0.12714000</longitude>              <year_start>1808</year_start>              <id>9732</id>              <date_text>1808-1810 (made) 1808 (painted)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AM8408</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description></physical_description>              <dimensions>Height: 158.5 cm, Width: 78 cm, Depth: 51 cm</dimensions>              <title></title>              <date_start>Jan. 1, 1808</date_start>              <materials_techniques>Mahogany, veneered with zebrawood and other woods, with gilt-bronze mounts</materials_techniques>              <last_processed>March 2, 2015, 8:41 p.m.</last_processed>              <label>British Galleries: This bureau bookcase illustrates the mixing of styles that was common in Regency objects.

People George Oakley was a very fashionable cabinetmaker with a shop at 8 Old Bond Street, London. The bureau bookcase is very similar in design to other pieces of furniture that were made by his firm, Oakley &amp; Evans. In 1801, the London correspondent of Journal der Luxus und der Moden, a German magazine, wrote that &#39;all people with taste buy their furniture at Oakeleys [sic], the most tasteful of the London cabinetmakers&#39;.  Materials &amp; Making By 1810, when this bureau bookcase was made, combinations of different styles and contrasting materials had become fashionable. The mounts are Egyptian figures while the glazing bars in the doors are Gothic. The exterior is covered with zebrawood, a dark and patterned wood from Brazil, while the interior is veneered in satinwood, which is light in colour and came from Ceylon.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography></bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>bureau-bookcase-oakley-george</slug>              <sys_updated>Aug. 4, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Oakley, George</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1810</year_end>              <object_number>O78953</object_number>              <credit></credit>              <history_note>Probably designed and made in London by George Oakley (died in 1841) of Oakley &amp; Evans, Old Bond Street, London; watercolours of the River Clyde signed by James Baynes (born in 1766, died in 1837)</history_note>              <place>London</place>              <production_note>Watercolours of the River Clyde signed by James Baynes (born in 1766, died in 1837)</production_note>              <historical_context_note></historical_context_note>              <collection_code>FWK</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>C.1700-1910</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1754</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Chinese snuff bottle, porcelain moulded in relief, painted decoration depicts the underside of a lotus flower, Qing Dynasty; ca. 1750.</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>104.16564900</longitude>              <year_start>1745</year_start>              <id>11611</id>              <date_text>ca. 1750 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2010EC4378</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description>The bottle is a round flattened flask form without a stopper.

This example is decorated with Turkish-influenced decoration of inlaid mother-of-pearl, then widely used in Venice, a maritime power with extensive links with the Eastern Mediterranean. The particular style of this mirror can be dated to the 1590s: a spinet with similar decoration was made in Venice by Giovanni Cellestini and dated 1593.

Formerly part of the collection of Edmond Bonnaff\\ufffd\\ufffd, eminent French art historian and collector (1825-1903) and bought in Paris at the sale of his collection,  lot 319, held at the H\\ufffd\\ufffdtel Drouot, Paris. Described as &#39;Venetian mirror on a lacquered stand with an inner frame of mother-o&#39; pearl.&#39;  See museum papers on the Fulgence nominal file. 25 lots were purchased at the Bonnaff\\ufffd\\ufffd sale 1/5/1897 at Rue Drouot, Paris, via M. Fulgence (a dealer, who bid on behalf of the Museum): museum nos. 489-1897 to 517-1897 inclusive. Museum staff visited Bonnaff\\ufffd\\ufffd&#39;s house at Passy on 28/4/1897, before the private view of the sale, with B assisting and offering information on the history of each piece and repairs that had been carried out. 32 pieces were selected for biddign, the &#39;gem of the collection&#39; being a &#39;very beautiful piece of French Renaissance furniture - No. 349 - a small credence or cupboard, which we have valued at 10,000 frances (\\ufffd\\ufffd400)&#39;. The Museum hoped that George Salting would continue the bidding if/when the bids exceeded the SKM limit, but in the event, neither the Museum nor Salting bought  it.  Although widely published, this is an unusual survival and no other mirrors of similar form are known, though the type of decoration is found on many other luxury objects (see below). The heavy scrolling form of the base with a central oval plaque is not commonly found on furnishings but the cresting of the walnut choir stalls in the church of Santa Giustina, Padua by Maestro Rizzardo Taurino and associates (1556-1560) indicates the currency of the form. Elaborate frames to mirrors in various materials are however recorded: silver, gilded wood, pastiglia, ivory etc.</history_note>              <place>Venice</place>              <production_note>glass plate probably added some time in 19th Century</production_note>              <historical_context_note>Various contemporary pictures show mirrors in use, usually in the bedchamber or dressing room of the house, and used when arranging one&#39;s coiffure, as Gilles Corrozet confirms in his Blason du Miroir, where he describes a Miroir de verre bien bruny/D&#39;une riche chasse garny/Ou la belle, plaisante, et clere/Se void, se mire, et considere... (Mirror of well burnished glass fitted with a rich frame in which the beauty views herself pleasantly and clearly, admires herself and surveys...)  Gustav Ludwig, p.306 notes that flat mirrors are rarely recorded in inventories, but cites one example &quot;specchij cum el pe&quot; (mirror with a foot) in relation to this mirror.  P.K.Thornton, The Italian Renaissance Interior 1400-1600 (London 1991), pp.234-9 on mirrors notes that mirrors in Italy would have been familiar to most people of any standing by 1400 and even earlier, though references to mirrors in Italian household inventories seems to be rare before about 1450. Until well into the 16th century steel mirrors were more common than silvered glass ones. Glass mirrors were being made in Germany in the 14th century, and in Murano during the 15th century, apparently as early as 1420. From 1507 Venetian mirror production developed into a dominant position. Pains were taken to preserve mirror plates from damage, with the use of curtains, shutters or special cases  Decoration Fine lacquerwork was made in Persia during the 16th century. It was commonly decorated with moresques executed in gold: this was done on relatively  small items, such as folding book-rests, book-covers, containers for writing materials, etc. Such objects excited the admiration of Europeans whenever they saw them, and early imitations of this work embodying moresque decoration were made in Venice. The technique was deemed suitable for embellishing the covers of highly important government documents, so apparently carried no light-hearted or frivolous connotation in the way that imitations of Chinese artefacts were often to do later. Venetian lacquer was also used for making small objects, such as jewel caskets covered with moresques, although entirely occidental figure-subjects occasionally  occupy panels within the imitation Islamic ornament. Sometimes the ground of the panels in such work was made of mother-of-pearl which reflects light back through the painted deocration applied on to it. A similar effect was contrived with a gold ground over which painted decoration was applied; the colours were often applied so as to form \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe ground\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, leaving the pattern itself unpainted (reserved as it is called).. exemplified on the V&amp;A \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdQueen Elizabeth virginals\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (about 1570) or a harp ordered for the private orchestra of Duke Alfonso d\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEste (1581, Rome). Thornton pp.34-5  Huth says that from the 13th century Venice had been an entry point to Europe for goods (earthenware, metalwork, textiles, jewelry and lacquerware) from the Levant and Orient. A Venetian document of 1283 consists of rules for the depentores (those working with a brush, involved in the production of varnished caskets, tables and woodwork). The decoration of wares as opposed to simply protecting them with varnishes seems to have begun during the mid 16th century. A Syrian craft which may have inspired Venetian artisans working in lacquer was the practice of damascening metal, known in Milan and Venice as early as 1300. The Italian craftsmen (no oriental craftsmen resided in Venice) who practised this art  were called azziministi. Another Oriental craft introduced to Venice from the late 15th century was the practise of fashioning elaborate bindings for books. Venetian copies or adaptations of lacquered bindings \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdin the Persian style\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd date from the middle of the 16th century (eg Binding, Museo Correr 1570-77).  European engravings based on Moresque designs, such as those by \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe Master F\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, were circulating in Italian workshops as early as 1520. Venetian shields of wood covered with parchment, painted with knotwork and scrolls, and with areas in white, red and green that shone through the varnish, giving the effect of lacquer survive in armeria of the Doge\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds palace (Venice ) and from the household of the Bishop of Salzburg. Huth discusses other types of object (probably Venetian) with similar decoration, which may have been what was referred to by Italians variously as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfrissi grottesche\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdalla zemina\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the Persian manner, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpetteniera turchesca\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the Turkish manner: a quiver case, a folding table, small cases (casse da pettenti), caskets (scrigni or possibly what was known as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcasse da conzar il cao\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, boxes for dressing the hair), mirror frames and frames of architectural form with or without inset marble plaques, cuoridoro shields (described by Contadini in At Home in Renaissance Italy eds. Ajmar-Wollheim, and Dennis, pp.319-321), cabinets with leather coverings and musical instruments such as harpsichords and harps.  Monika Kopplin, European Lacquer (Munich, 2010), pp.23-34 Kopplin notes that Venice traded in shellac, mainly from north-east India, Indochina and Sumatra, and maintains that Islamic lacquered objects (made from as early as the 10th/11th centuries) were undoubtedly present in Venice by the 16th century. Recent studies of the techniques used found that Venetian &#39;lacquer&#39; was generally made up of linseed oil and colophony derived from pine resin, a composition also mentioned in contemporary writings such as Leonardo Fioravanti (1517-1588) in his &#39;Compendio  di secreti rationali&#39; (Venice 1562). Turpentine of larch, also known as &#39;Venice turpentine&#39; was also used, though not sandarac, the most important resin in Islamic lacquerwork but problematic on account of its limited availability and complex preparation. Arabesques were applied in powdered gold on the black-painted wood, and gold leaf employed for gilding larger decorative surfaces which were then given a luminous glow through a lustre finish in a variety of colours. Tempera was probably used as well as oils, and a final coat of glossy varnish applied. These studies suggest that the stylistic imitation of Islamic models was coupled with the use of largely identical techniques (p.24, citing Adriana Rizzo, &#39;Le &quot;laque&quot; v\\ufffd\\ufffdnitien: Une approche scientifique&#39;, in Venise et l&#39;Orient 828-1797, exh. cat., Institut du monde arabe, Paris (2006), pp. 244-51)</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>FWK</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>FA.226[O]</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1814</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Oil painting entitled &#39;The Refusal&#39; by Sir David Wilkie.

Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, HMSO, London, 1990.  p.xviii.  John Sheepshanks (1784-1863) was the son of a wealthy cloth manufacturer.  He entered the family business, but his early enthusiasms were for gardening and the collecting of Dutch and Flemish prints.  He retired from business at the age of 40, by which time he had begun collecting predominantly in the field of modern British art.  He told Richard Redgrave RA, then a curator in the South Kensington Museum (later the V&amp;A) of his intention to give his collection to the nation.  The gallery built to house the collection was the first permanent structure on the V&amp;A site, and all concerned saw the Sheepshanks Gift as forming the nucleus of a National Gallery of British Art.  Sheepshanks commissioned works from contemporary artists, bought from the annual RA summer exhibitions, but also bought paintings by artists working before Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837.  The Sheepshanks Gift is the bedrock of the V&amp;A&#39;s collection of British oil paintings, and served to encourage many other collectors to make donations and bequests.  Historical significance: Sir David Wilkie R.A. (November 1785-1841) was born at Cults, which is about twenty miles north of Edinburgh.  His father was the minister there and his maternal grandfather owned the mill at Pitlessie.  His formal artistic training began when he was fifteen and his family sent him to the Trustees&#39; Academy in Edinburgh; this was the earliest publicly funded art school in Britain.  He moved to London in 1805, and first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1806 at the age of only twenty.  His painting &quot;The Village Politicians&quot; was a sensation and he was immediately something of a celebrity.  He went on to become internationally recognised, his paintings of everyday life, with strong narrative themes, peopled with expressive characters and packed with eye-catching details, hugely popular with the public.  He was made a full member of the Royal Academy in 1811, was appointed Painter to the King in 1830 and was knighted in 1836.

Duncan has come to woo Maggie, who is at first stand-offish until her admirer&#39;s pride is hurt, whereupon she falls lovesick; finally they manage to synchronise their affections.       The text had been suggested to Wilkie as a subject as early as 1807 by George Thomson, the folk-music collector and publisher, to whom Burns had sent the song soon after they began their collaboration on &lt;i&gt;A Select Collection of Original Scotch Airs&lt;/i&gt; in 1792; in 1819 Wilkie painted a smaller repetition of the composition for him (NGS). Thomson was notoriously guilty of playing fast and loose with the material Burns sent him, and Wilkie has followed his precedent: his amendments to the poem include adding the girl&#39;s family, anxious at her wilfulness, and omitting the drink - according to Burns the story takes place &#39;On blythe yule night when we were fu&quot; (drunk).       &lt;i&gt;The Refusal&lt;/i&gt; stands out among the pictures Wilkie painted in London before his Highland tour of 1817 as being the most evocatively Scottish (he had already painted at least one other illustration to Burns - &lt;i&gt;The Vision&lt;/i&gt; - while a student in Edinburgh). Thus it appealed strongly to the miniature painter Andrew Robertson when he considered the future of a Scottish school of painting in a speech to the Highland Society of London in 1818 marking the election of Wilkie as an honorary member (at the time the picture was on show at the British Institution): &#39;In one moment it comprises the whole drama of that favourite song, and holds out an useful model to young women. So rich is the invention of Wilkie, so exquisite his feeling, that he goes farther even than our immortal Bard; not only do his figures speak, but the spectator is insensibly taught to moralize. What moral did a Dutch picture ever inculcate?&#39; Perhaps thinking of Edinburgh rather than London, Robertson concluded &#39;Would to God, that Wilkie&#39;s Duncan Gray could be secured as the foundation of a national gallery!&#39; (&lt;i&gt;Literary Gazette&lt;/i&gt; [4 April 1818], 216-7).&quot;  Troman&#39;s notes under cat. no. 4, &quot;The Blind Fiddler&quot; (Tate Gallery), which is also on panel and dates from 1806, that this &quot;was the first major work of Wilkie&#39;s to be painted on a wooden panel rather than canvas, one of the most far-reaching technical means by which he sought to emulate Netherlandish art after his move to London (several eighteenth-century French painters had also regularly used panel, such as Greuze and Vig\\ufffd\\ufffde-Lebrun).&quot;  The &quot;Broken Jar&quot; was painted a decade later, and Wilkie continued to use panel as well as canvas throughout his career.</history_note>              <place>Great Britain</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note>This is one of eight works attributed to David Wilkie (1785-1841) which were given to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum by to the collector John Sheepshanks (1784-1863) in 1857, only 16 years after Wilkie&#39;s death.  But although Sheepshanks and Wilkie were contemporaries and Sheepshanks knew personally many of the artists whose work he owned, it seems likely that the works attributed to Wilkie in Sheepshanks&#39; collection were not purchased directly from the artist  .</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>PDP</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>W.9-1972</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1590</date_end>              <descriptive_line>One half of a games board</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>12.31849000</longitude>              <year_start>1565</year_start>              <id>18825</id>              <date_text>ca. 1570-90 (made)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2009BY8405</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description>A games board, the carcase wood (unidentified) veneered with a tropical hardwood (rosewood or ebony) with gilt moresque decoration, and inlaid with three colours of lapis lazuli: a darker shade with gold veining, a pale shade with speckling, and a blue/white marbled shade.

The three patterns of blue lapis lazuli used probably came from Afghanistan, and were known in the 16th century as &#39;Persian lapis lazuli&#39;. The gilded decoration of delicate moresque ornament is painted on rich veneers of tropical hardwood. It was particularly fashionable in Venice 1560-1600 for a wide range of luxury products from musical instruments to bookbindings, small boxes and mirror frames. The taste in Venice (and nearby Padua) for Moresque ornament was probably first inspired during the 1470s by Islamic book bindings imported from cities in Turkey, Egypt, Persia and Syria.</public_access_description>              <exhibition_history></exhibition_history>              <bibliography>Andrea Palladio, 1508-1580 : the portico and the farmyard / catalogue by Howard Burns in collaboration with Lynda Fairbairn and Bruce Boucher, London 1975, cat. no. 107</bibliography>              <vanda_exhibition_history></vanda_exhibition_history>              <slug>games-board-unknown</slug>              <sys_updated>Nov. 5, 2014, midnight</sys_updated>              <artist>Unknown</artist>              <historical_significance></historical_significance>              <year_end>1590</year_end>              <object_number>O61532</object_number>              <credit>Bequeathed by the 6th Duke of Wellington</credit>              <history_note>Bequeathed by (Gerald), 7th Duke of Wellington, Stratfield Saye House, Reading, Berks.

This board forms half of a typical 16th century &#39;pair of tables&#39; for games. Another board half would have completed the backgammon board with larger merels (nine men&#39;s morris) on the reverse. However, there is no evidence of hinging on W.9-1972, perhaps because the weight of the boards would have put undue strain on the hinges, so it may be assumed that the pair, though used together were not physically joined.   The attribution to Venice, an established centre for the production of luxury artefacts in the 16th century, rests in large part on the painted decoration of gilt moresques (see below). Although similar gamesboards with hardstone and painted moresque ornament have not been identified, the combination on Venetian luxury objects c.1550-1600 of hardstone and painted moresque suggests that a Venetian origin for this board is likely.  This gamesboard may be considered as a product of the late 16th century Venetian interest in what was known as Persian style decoration. There is certainly a neat congruence between the use of &#39;Persian lapis lazuli&#39; and gilded moresque decoration &#39;in the Persian style&#39;. The likely design of the gamespieces that would have accompanied the board remains a matter for speculation; possibly they would have been cut and carved in hardstone or exotic hardwood, like the veneers and mouldings used on the board.</history_note>              <place>Venice</place>              <production_note></production_note>              <historical_context_note>Lapis lazuli is characterised by its intense deep-blue colours, and by specks of tiny, sometimes auriferous pyrite crystals that create a sparkling effect. Some less pure varieties have white or grey specks due to the presence of calcareous matter. Although less valuable, these varieties were useful in decorative hardstone work. During the renaissance the most intense and uniformly coloured variety came from Badakshan in Afghanistan and was called &#39;Persian lapis lazuli&#39;. Other, more speckled varieties were obtained in France (and from the end of the eighteenth century Russia became the main exporter to Europe). (Taken mainly from Anna Maria Giusti: Pietre Dure - Hardstone in Furniture and Decorations. (London, 1992), p. 270)  &#39;Because for centuries Venice was the main European port of entry for exotic hardstones from the Orient, it is not surprising that La Serenissima - the Republic of Venice - has a long history of hardstone cutting. The hardstone carvers&#39; guild was established there in 1284, only slightly later than the one in Paris. Regulations for the craft followed in 1318 and were enforced. Venetian luxury goods flooded into the northern states of Italy and encouraged the growth of the industry, not only there but also in much of Europe. ...The.. lapis lazuli from Afghanistan [was] either brought west along Ottoman trade routes that ended in Venice or were spoils from Byzantium.&#39; Koeppe notes, in relation to a late 16th century Venetian cabinet inset with lapis lazuli and various hardstones, and partly gilded with arabesques, that the combination of carefully chosen semiprecious stones (naturalia) and the elegant design and fine craftsmanship of the wooden structure, decorated with sparkling gold paint and arabesques (arteficialia), was particularly appropriate to a collector&#39;s curiosity cabinet.

[See also NEW YORK, Metropolitan Museum, Stefano Carboni (ed.), Venice and the Islamic world, 828-1797, (New York, New Haven, 2007)]  For discussion of this type of painted decoration, see Huth, Hans: Lacquer of the West. The History of a craft and an industry, 1550 - 1950. (Chicago, 1971), chapter 1; Peter Thornton, Form and Decoration (London, 1998), chapter 3; Alberici, Clelia: Il Mobile Veneto (Milan, 1980), p.61ff.; Anna Contadini &#39;Middle-Eastern objects&#39; in At Home in Renaissance Italy, eds.Marta Ajmar-Wollheim and Flora Dennis (London, 2006), p308ff.; Ernst J. Grube &quot;Venetian lacquer and Bookbindings of the sixteenth century.&quot; in New York, Metropolitan Museum, Stefano Carboni (ed.), Venice and the Islamic world, 828-1797, (New York, New Haven, 2007), pp. 230-43  Fine lacquerwork was made in Persia during the 16th century. It was commonly decorated with moresques executed in gold: this was done on relatively small items, such as folding book-rests, book-covers, containers for writing materials, etc. Such objects excited the admiration of Europeans whenever they saw them, and early imitations of this work embodying moresque decoration were made in Venice. The technique was deemed suitable for embellishing the covers of highly important government documents, so apparently carried no light-hearted or frivolous connotation in the way that imitations of Chinese artefacts were often to do later. Venetian lacquer was also used for making small objects, such as jewel caskets covered with moresques, although entirely occidental figure-subjects occasionally occupy panels within the imitation Islamic ornament. Sometimes the ground of the panels in such work was made of mother-of-pearl which reflects light back through the painted deocration applied on to it. A similar effect was contrived with a gold ground over which painted decoration was applied; the colours were often applied so as to form \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe ground\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, leaving the pattern itself unpainted (reserved as it is called).. exemplified on the V&amp;A \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdQueen Elizabeth virginals\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (about 1570) or a harp ordered for the private orchestra of Duke Alfonso d\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEste (1581, Rome). Thornton pp.34-5  Huth says that from the 13th century Venice had been an entry point to Europe for goods (earthenware, metalwork, textiles, jewelry and lacquerware) from the Levant and Orient. A Venetian document of 1283 consists of rules for the depentores (those working with a brush, involved in the production of varnished caskets, tables and woodwork). The decoration of wares as opposed to simply protecting them with varnishes seems to have begun during the mid 16th century. A Syrian craft which may have inspired Venetian artisans working in lacquer was the practice of damascening metal, known in Milan and Venice as early as 1300. The Italian craftsmen (no oriental craftsmen resided in Venice) who practised this art  were called azziministi. Another Oriental craft introduced to Venice from the late 15th century was the practise of fashioning elaborate bindings for books. Venetian copies or adaptations of lacquered bindings \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdin the Persian style\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd date from the middle of the 16th century (eg Binding, Museo Correr 1570-77). European engravings based on Moresque designs, such as those by \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe Master F\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, were circulating in Italian workshops as early as 1520.   Huth discusses other types of object (probably Venetian) with similar decoration, which may have been what was referred to by Italians variously as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfrissi grottesche\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdalla zemina\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the Persian manner, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpetteniera turchesca\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the Turkish manner: a quiver case, a folding table, small cases (casse da pettenti), caskets (scrigni or possibly what was known as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcasse da conzar il cao\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, boxes for dressing the hair), mirror frames and frames of architectural form with or without inset marble plaques, cuoridoro shields (described by Contadini in At Home in Renaissance Italy eds. Ajmar-Wollheim, and Dennis, pp.319-321), cabinets with leather coverings and musical instruments such as harpsichords and harps. Most relevant to discussion of the V&amp;A gamesboard is a group of various frames (which Huth describes as Venetian c.1580) of architectural form survive, with inset marble slabs, and with black/gold moresque patterns on the cornices and mouldings (pl.14-19). Some frames of this type are incorporated into table cabinets.</historical_context_note>              <collection_code>FWK</collection_code>       </museumobject>     <museumobject>                   <original_price></original_price>              <attributions_note></attributions_note>              <related_museum_numbers></related_museum_numbers>              <museum_number>P.2-1942</museum_number>              <date_end>Dec. 31, 1578</date_end>              <descriptive_line>Portrait miniature of Alice Brandon, Mrs. Hilliard, water colour on vellum, painted by Nicholas Hilliard, 1578.</descriptive_line>              <shape></shape>              <longitude>1.71832000</longitude>              <year_start>1578</year_start>              <id>19058</id>              <date_text>1578 (painted)</date_text>              <primary_image_id>2006AP6272</primary_image_id>              <rights>3</rights>              <physical_description>Portrait of Alice Brandon, Mrs Hilliard, head and shoulders, wearing a ruff, in a circular frame with a decorative border with inscriptions in gold.</physical_description>              <dimensions>Height: 59 mm, Width: 57.5 mm</dimensions>              <title>Alice Brandon, Mrs Hilliard</title>              <date_start>Jan. 1, 1578</date_start>              <materials_techniques>Watercolour on vellum stuck to card; later stuck to a larger piece of circular card upon which the later outer band of inscription and decoration has been painted</materials_techniques>              <last_processed>March 2, 2015, 9:07 p.m.</last_processed>              <label></label>              <event_text></event_text>              <production_type></production_type>              <location>Portrait Miniatures, room 90a, case 2</location>              <marks>&#39;NH&#39;  &#39;Ano Dni / * AEsS. 22.&#39;  &#39;+ ALICIA .

Alice Brandon (b. 1556-d. before 1608, daughter of Robert Brandon, the Queen\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds goldsmith, married Nicholas Hilliard in 1675 and bore him seven children, Daniel, Elizabeth, Francis, Laurence, Lettice, Penelope and Robert.  This delightful miniature was definitely painted while Hilliard was in France and is recognized as the prime instance of a more direct contact with the portraiture of Francois Clouet.  Its sensitivity and feminine charm reflects very full the impact of French portraiture which, particularly in the chalk drawings, aimed at catching fleeting expression.  The face has been damaged, with restoration to the forehead.  There is a degree of flaking and the usual fading and oxidizing of the silver.  This retains a frame of a type which at one time was also added to both the miniature of Nicholas and Richard Hilliard (nos. 48, 49).  It would seem highly likely that this decorative border was added by Laurence Hilliard.  The inscription refers to Alice as &lt;i&gt;UXOR PRIMA&lt;/i&gt;, Hilliard\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds first wife which would indicate that the Nicholas who married Susan Gysard in 1608 was the miniaturist (Edmond &lt;i&gt;Limners and Picture-makers&lt;/i&gt;, p. 68).  This is a rare instance of Hilliard signing with a monogram NH.  INSCRIBED: Above the shoulders: &lt;i&gt;NH&lt;/i&gt; (in monogram); on either side of the head: &lt;i&gt;Ano Dni / * AEsS. 22.&lt;/i&gt; On the mount over the arms left of Hilliard and right of Brandon and the inscription: &lt;i&gt;+ ALICIA . BRANDON NICOLAI HILLYARD . Q / VI PROPRIA MANV DEPINXIT VXOR PRIMA.&lt;/i&gt;  COLLECTIONS: The miniature is not referred to in Laurence Hilliard\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds will as are those of her husband and father-in-law (see no. 48) which supposes a different descent; it was purchased together with another Hilliard by Walter Francis, 5th Duke of Buccleuch, in 1869; thence by descent; acquired through the N.A.C.F., 1942.

The hilt is decorated with the archangel Michael, and the use of oxidisation is typical of Froment-Meurice&#39;s interest in surface treatments and decorative effects. He was hugely celebrated as a jeweller and goldsmith, winning medals and accolades whenever he exhibited. The Museum bought extensively from the firm, an indication of its reputation. Much of this success was due to his workshop subcontractors, who included some of the finest artists and craftsmen of the period. Froment-Meurice&#39;s stand at the Great Exhibition was unusual amongst the French manufacturers for its mixture of plate, jewellery and objects of vertu.
