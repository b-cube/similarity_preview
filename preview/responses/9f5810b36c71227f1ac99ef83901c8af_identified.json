These adjustments involve an active and dynamic balance between defensive and non-defensive behaviors, and underlying each change are the fundamental alterations within the neural circuits that form the cellular bases for those behaviors. The marine mollusk Aplysia californica provides an ideal model system for examining plasticity at both the behavioral and neural levels following exposure to aversive stimuli. After receiving a noxious stimulus, Aplysia elicit the learned behavioral change known as sensitization through which their defensive responses are enhanced, in particular the tail-siphon withdrawal reflex (TSWR). Sensitization of the TSWR manifests from an increase in facilitation at the neuronal synapses that govern the reflex. Sensitization training induces a concurrent suppression of non-defensive behaviors, particularly feeding behavior. The suppression of feeding results from a decrease in excitability of neuron B51, which is a key decision-making neuron in the feeding neural circuit that is critical to the production of feeding behavior. The neurotransmitter serotonin has been shown to mediate and induce the sensitization of the TSWR, but it is not involved in the concomitant suppression of feeding behavior. This study proposed the neurotransmitter nitric oxide (NO) as the signaling molecule that mediates the modification of feeding. The goal of this study was to examine the roles of NO signaling in the enhancement of the TSWR produced by sensitization training, the sensitization training-induced suppression of feeding, and the modulation of the feeding neural circuit. NO signaling was found to be necessary for sensitization training-induced behavioral plasticity. When NO signaling was pharmacologically blocked by in vivo application of the NO synthase inhibitor N?-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), sensitization training failed to produce the sensitization of the TSWR. L-NAME also prevented sensitization training from inducing the suppression of feeding behavior known to occur concomitantly with the sensitization of the TSWR. These results suggested that modifications of both defensive and non-defensive behaviors via aversive learning were prevented when NO signaling was blocked. NO signaling was also found to modulate the Aplysia feeding neural circuit. NO is known to tonically inhibit feeding behavior in vivo. The application of L-NAME in vitro to isolated preparations of the feeding circuit caused the excitability and activity of neuron B51 to increase. Conversely, when NO signaling was augmented by in vitro application of the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) to the isolated feeding circuit, the excitability of B51 decreased in a manner analogous to that produced by sensitization training. Neither L-NAME nor SNAP treatments affected the resting membrane properties of B51, indicating that the bidirectional modulation of B51 excitability by NO signaling acts through voltage-dependent channels. Based on these results, it is evident that NO signaling modulates the changes in multiple behaviors following exposure to aversive stimuli, and that NO signaling is significantly involved in and essential for behavioral and cellular plasticity in Aplysia. </summary> <dc:date>2014-08-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Sleep Disorders Treatment Survey</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/153675\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/153675</id> <updated>2015-02-26T15:47:00Z</updated> <published>2014-08-18T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Sleep Disorders Treatment Survey Even though the Association of Sleep Disorders Center was founded in 1976, sleep medicine wasn?t considered a specialty until 1996. The United States population has undergone a 20% decrease in sleep time over the past century, with a concurrent increase in reported sleep disorders. Sleep disorders are similar to the ?silent killer? heart disease in that they frequently go undiagnosed. While personal health can be affected by sleep disorders, there is also a risk to third parties. Big trucks are responsible for 4,000 fatalities yearly, and 28% of commercial driver?s license (CDL) drivers have diagnosed sleep apnea. A government passed bill HR3095 regulates physical exams required by CDL drivers. A licensed CDL driver now has to be seen by a medical examiner registered by the National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners to be eligible to drive once diagnosed with a sleep disorder. Several treatments are offered to alleviate the symptoms of sleep disorders. The standard form of treatment requires patients to wear devices that often result in low compliance. However, it is unclear what types of treatments patients try, and whether they eventually find a treatment that works to alleviate their symptoms.  This study was performed on 86 subjects to obtain a census of what treatments people who had been diagnosed with sleep disorders used to alleviate their symptoms. There are no current cures for sleep disorders but the symptoms can be managed. This survey assesses patient knowledge and where they acquired their information about sleep disorders and treatment, which treatments were used, what symptoms were experienced, and quality of life issues. The majority of subjects acquired their information about sleep disorders from their dentists, sleep physician, family doctor, family/friends and the internet (94%). Over 76% of the subjects stated that they had sleep disordered breathing symptoms for 6 years or more. There were several modalities of treatments used; nonsurgical, surgical and pharmacological. The two preferred treatments of choice were continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machines and adjustable oral appliances (aOA). Subjects used aOA (80.2%) more often than CPAP (11.6%). Mann Whitney U-tests showed significantly fewer traveling difficulties and less interference with their quality of life with aOA than CPAP use. There was significant improvement after treatment in snoring, fatigue, and feeling refreshed in the morning regardless of treatment modality. </summary> <dc:date>2014-08-18T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>The Epidemiology and Impact of Dog-Associated Zoonoses in Developed and Developing Countries</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/153674\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/153674</id> <updated>2015-02-26T15:47:00Z</updated> <published>2014-08-04T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The Epidemiology and Impact of Dog-Associated Zoonoses in Developed and Developing Countries Dogs are an important part of human societies throughout the world. Although people derive many economic and health benefits from their relationships with dogs, these relationships are not without risk. Interaction with dogs can lead to an increased risk for zoonotic diseases, if the appropriate precautions are not taken. While dogs contribute to the transmission of a variety of zoonoses, only a few of these diseases, such as rabies and cystic echinococcosis, are recognized as having widespread economic and public health implications.  In order to assess the knowledge and perceptions of dog-associated zoonoses in Brazos County, Texas, random digit dialing was used to select households for participation in a cross-sectional telephone survey. Of the 1691 households, which were contacted, 922 (55%) completed the interview. Dog owners accounted for 56% of the study participants. Eighty-six percent of the respondents indicated they would report being bitten by a dog that they did not own. Factors that were shown to be significantly associated with bite reporting included, age, sex, urbanicity, and rabies knowledge. Many of the respondents lacked knowledge about dog-associated zoonoses, which could seriously affect their health.   Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is known to be endemic in Rio Negro Province, Argentina. However, current epidemiological data were not available for this region. A community-based CE screening study, which incorporated diagnostic imaging and a questionnaire, was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of human CE and identify locally relevant risk factors in the study population. The overall CE prevalence among the community volunteers was 7.1%, with 1.6% of children, and 10% of adults diagnosed as CE-positive. Age, level of education, dog ownership, and contact with sheep were found to be significantly associated with CE status.  In regions of the world where CE is highly endemic, it has been shown to be a substantial financial burden for those who are affected. When the costs associated with human CE, obtained from hospital chart reviews and patient interviews, were combined with livestock-associated costs obtained from government reports and scientific publications, the estimated total annual cost of CE in Rio Negro Province was $5,100,373 (95% CI: $2,852,345?$8,004,122). </summary> <dc:date>2014-08-04T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Static, Rotordynamic, and Thermal Characteristics of a Four Pad Spherical-Seat Tilting Pad Journal Bearing with Four Methods of Directed Lubrication</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/153673\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/1969.1/153673</id> <updated>2015-02-26T15:47:00Z</updated> <published>2014-08-07T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Static, Rotordynamic, and Thermal Characteristics of a Four Pad Spherical-Seat Tilting Pad Journal Bearing with Four Methods of Directed Lubrication Static, dynamic, and thermal characteristics (measured and predicted) are presented for a 4-pad, spherical-seat, TPJB with 0.5 pivot offset, 0.6 L/D, 101.6 mm nominal diameter, and 0.3 preload in the LBP orientation. One bearing is tested four separate times in the following four different lubrication configurations: (1) flooded single-orifice (SO) at the bearing shell, (2) evacuated leading edge groove (LEG), (3) evacuated spray-bar blocker (SBB), and (4) evacuated spray-bar (SB). The LEG, SBB, and SB are all considered methods of ?directed lubrication?. These methods rely on lubrication injected directly to the pad/rotor interface. The same set of pads is used for every test to maintain clearance and preload; each method of lubrication is added as an assembly to the bearing.  Test conditions include surface speeds and unit loads up to 85 m/s and 2.9 MPa respectively. Static data includes measured bearing clearances prior to operation (cold) and immediately after operation (hot), rotor-bearing eccentricities and attitude angles, and a new approach to locating the hot center of a bearing. Dynamic data includes: (1) impedance values calculated from measured accelerations, displacements, and excitation forces; and (2) four sets (one set for each bearing configuration) of direct and cross-coupled rotordynamic coefficients derived from measurements and fit to a frequency independent KCM model.  Thermal data include measured temperatures from sixteen bearing thermocouples along with inlet, outlet, stator housing, and ambient thermocouples. Twelve of the bearing thermocouples are embedded in the babbitt layer of the pads while the remaining four are oriented at the leading and trailing edge of the loaded pads exposed to the lubricant. Bearing thermocouples provide a circumferential and axial temperature gradient.  The pivot stiffness (pad and pivot in series) is measured and incorporated into predictions. Measured static, dynamic, and thermal values are compared to predictions from XL_TPJB, a computer code developed at the Texas A&amp;M University Turbomachinery Lab for predicting bearing performance.  Measurements show significant cross-coupled stiffness terms with opposite signs and magnitudes that are 20-50% of the direct terms, a max axial temperature gradient of 9.6 ?C, and attitude angles as high as 29?; all of these indicate that the tilt motion of the pad may be impeded by friction between the spherical pivot and the pad.  Temperature measurements show directed lubrication, coupled with an evacuated bearing housing, reduces max bearing temperatures up to 13.9 ?C for the LEG, 10.2 ?C for the SBB, and 12.8 ?C for the SB. Although the SB and SBB reduce the max bearing temperature as intended, they can also cause an increase in temperatures at the leading and trailing edges of the loaded pads. The LEG typically reduced temperatures at all locations. Compared to the base case of the flooded SO, directed lubrication reduces the max bearing temperature. Additionally, the dynamics of the system can also be significantly impacted. Using directed lubrication can reduce direct stiffness by up to 18% for the LEG, 25% for the SBB, and 20% for the SB. Similarly, the direct damping can be reduced by up to 24% for the LEG, 45% for the SBB, and 34% for the SB. </summary> <dc:date>2014-08-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
