Tick sampling data (91 files, each representing a day of sampling) indicate tick abundance (distinguishing larvae, nymphs, adult males and adult females), vegetation height, soil moisture, temperature and relative humidity.  Static risk map files indicate modeled tick abundance: 251 landcover files for the three sites, as well as 36 ArcView map files.  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  Many people take pleasure from activities in forests and wild lands in the UK and others are being encouraged to participate. Unfortunately, there are risks and one of the most insidious is the possibility (albeit tiny) of acquiring a disease from wild animals; for example, ticks can be vectors of the bacterial infection leading to Lyme Disease. Both diagnosis and treatment can be problematic so prevention of acquiring such disease is highly desirable.  Surprisingly little is known about how best to warn countryside users about the potential for disease without scaring them away or spoiling their enjoyment. Answering such questions was the goal of this project, and required the integration of a diverse set of scientific skills, and an understanding of the views of those who manage countryside, those who have contracted zoonotic diseases and those who access the land.  This project combined knowledge from three strands of work, namely risk assessment, risk perception and communication, and scenario analysis. The study sites were selected to provide a range of environmental conditions and countryside use. Peri-urban parkland, accessible lowland forest and heath and remote upland forest were chosen as represented by Richmond Park on the fringe of Greater London, the New Forest in Southern England, and Exmoor in South West England.  The following additional data from this same research project are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6892 (see online resources): Lyme disease risk perception data resulting from tick imagery vignette experiments, Lyme disease patient interviews and surveys, residents and countryside staff focus groups, forest manager interviews, and multiple scoring procedures of animal social representation; as well as Lyme and tick risk communication data resulting from interviews with organisations and content analysis of risk warning information leaflets,  Further documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal and the project's ESRC funding award web page (see online resources).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Rick Stuart</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Human health and safety</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rural Economy and Land Use Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Assessing and communicating animal disease risks for countryside users</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>health risks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>leisure time activities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>lyme disease</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>national parks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>nature reserves</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tourism</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>zoonotic diseases</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDS</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-25T13:14:24Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/de5447b7-70bb-4a11-822b-c1f53987681e\">     <title>Bird abundance and distribution on Peak District farms and moorlands, 2007-2008 - RELU Sustainability of hill farming</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/de5447b7-70bb-4a11-822b-c1f53987681e</link>     <description>This data set consists of the tabulated results of bird surveys on Peak District farms and moorlands. Bird abundance and distribution on Peak District farms and moorlands, 2007-2008  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  The project used the Peak District National Park as a case study to examine the impact of hill farming practices on upland biodiversity (using birds as an indicator group); how hill farms were responding to ongoing and future changes to policies and prices; what this would in turn imply for upland biodiversity; what the public wanted from upland ecosystems and how policies could be designed better to deliver public goods from hill farms.  To answer these questions, the project team conducted ecological and economic surveys on hill farms; used survey results to parameterise ecological and economic models of this farming system; developed new ways to integrate these into coupled ecological and economic models and paid particular attention to interactions across farm boundaries; used the models to evaluate the performance of existing policies and to test designs that could lead to more effective policies; and conducted a range of choice experiments with different cross-sections of the general public to evaluate their preferences for upland landscapes.  Choice experiment, socio-economic survey and model data from this study are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6363 (see online resources).

The UKBMS comprises a suite of surveys carried out each year across the UK that generate data on butterfly abundance. The UKBMS started in 1976 (few sites from 1973) with thirty-six sites increasing to over a thousand by 2010. On the majority of these sites, recorders walk a fixed route (divided into up to 15 sections) at their site every week from 1st April to 29th September (total of 26 weeks), each year, counting butterflies within defined limits (5m box) when weather meets certain criteria. On some sites different survey techniques are employed to assess the abundance of species. These techniques include timed counts and larval web surveys in fixed areas. Weather data is recorded at the time of the count and habitat data is available for most transects. The surveys are undertaken by volunteers and other recorders, who contribute their data free of charge. The scheme is operated as a partnership between the Centre For Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC), and is jointly sponsored by a multi-agency consortium of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Natural Environment Research Council (through CEH), BC, Department of the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Countryside Council for Wales, Natural England, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission and Scottish Natural Heritage. UKBMS data is widely used for research; a list of publications as well as downloadable PDF copies of past Annual Reports is made available via the UKBMS website. Datasets currently available for download are yearly calculations of species trends and collated indices of abundance, as well as yearly updated site data. Access to the full dataset should be requested directly from the UKBMS.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-06T09:13:09Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31f301f5-5374-45c5-8db5-37ea43422b8d</link>     <description>Collated indices are a relative measure of butterfly abundance across monitored sites in the UK, calculated from data collected by the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS). Collated indices are calculated annually for each individual butterfly species that has been recorded on five or more sites in that year. Based on this criterion collated indices have been calculated for the entire UKBMS time series from 1976 to the current year for the majority of species. For some rarer species the time series starts in a later year due to lack of data. Collated indices are calculated using a statistical model that accounts for missing data. The number of sites for each species ranges from 5 to several hundred and varies from year to year. Since 2008 more than 1,000 sites have been monitored across the UK each year. Collated indices are calculated so that we can determine how butterfly populations are changing over time across the UK. This data can be used, for example, to determine where to target conservation efforts and to measure the condition of the UK countryside. Butterflies are recognised as important indicators of biodiversity and environmental change (e.g. as official UK Biodiversity Indicators), and have been used in numerous research studies to understand the impacts of changes in climate and the extent and condition of habitats. Although the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH) and Butterfly Conservation (BC) are responsible for the calculation and interpretation of the Collated indices, the collection of the data used in their creation is ultimately reliant on a large volunteer community. The UKBMS is funded by a consortium of organisations led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lepidoptera</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>butterflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03578</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-10-27T14:27:51Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/15b65cf5-d54a-43ff-9cd9-7483bea36ab3\">     <title>United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: species trends 2013</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/15b65cf5-d54a-43ff-9cd9-7483bea36ab3</link>     <description>This dataset provides linear trends, over varying time periods, for the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) Collated Indices of individual butterfly species across the UK. The main statistical values derived from a linear regression (slope, standard error, P-value) are presented for the entire time series for each species (1976 to 2013), for the last 20 years, and for the last decade. In addition a trend class, based on slope direction and its significance, and a percentage change for that time period are provided to describe the statistical trends. These trend data are provided for 59 UK butterfly species. Trends across different time series allow us to determine the long and short-term trends for individual species. This is enables us to focus conservation and research and also to assess species responses to conservation already in place.

The Climoor field site is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increase temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots(July to September annually). We have measured a range of key community characteristics and processes (ranging from plant diversity to rates of soil respiration) since the experiment began in 1998. In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain). Detailed descriptions of the site (including both vegetation and soil) and treatments are included in the supporting information as well as the methods used, and it is vital that this is considered when re-using this data. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Coordinate reference systems</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Elevation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Climate change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heathland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drought</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>warming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calluna</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vaccinium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Empetrum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>automated roof technology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>shrubland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Clocaenog Forest</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ruthin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NE Wales.</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere-vegetation-soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biweekly to annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03637 Task 11</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03012NEU Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02613 Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03425 Task 9</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02639 Task 2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01735NEW</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-26T14:42:39Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a60f52b8-0f9f-44f6-aca4-861cb461a0eb\">     <title>Location data of worker bumblebees across an agricultural landscape in Buckinghamshire, UK</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a60f52b8-0f9f-44f6-aca4-861cb461a0eb</link>     <description>This dataset contains locations of worker bumblebees of five species (Bombus terrestris, B. lapidarius, B. pascuorum, B. hortorum, B. ruderatus) across an agricultural landscape centred on the Hillesden Estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.

Three stones were taken from each of the 20 locations and epilithon removed from a defined area. Samples were kept in the cold and removed to the laboratory for analyses. DNA was extracted from all soil and epilithon samples using the MOBIO Powersoil 96 well DNA extraction kit. DNA was quality checked for purity and yield prior to submission for 454 pyrosequencing to assess both bacterial and eukaryotic biodiversity within each sample.
