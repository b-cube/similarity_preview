This process of exchange was called <term>antidosis</term>. The advantage of the system from the viewpoint of the democracy was that it encouraged the rich to be suspicious of each other, instead of being hostile towards the state; but although we know of several challenges, there is no attested case in which the exchange was completed. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">a)nti/dosis</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"apagoge\" n=\"apagoge\"> <head>apagoge</head>  <p><emph>apagoge</emph>, pl. <term>apagogai</term> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>dragging away,</soCalled> i.e., to the appropriate magistrate.

Its powers had been severely restricted by the democratic reforms of <name type=\"person\">Ephialtes</name> in the <dateRange from=\"-469\" to=\"-460\">460s BCE</dateRange>, which left it as little more than the main court for cases of homicide; in the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">fourth century</dateRange> however other powers were added, most notably <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"apophasis\">apophasis</xref>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">*)/areios pa/gos; *)/areos pa/gos</foreign>.</p>   </div0>   <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"arkhon\" n=\"arkhon\"> <head>arkhon</head>  <p><emph>arkhon</emph>, pl. <term>arkhontes</term> (participle acting as a noun), Eng. <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">archon</xref> or arkhon &#183; Lit. <soCalled>one who is in authority.</soCalled> Used in three senses: loosely, to refer to any Athenian public official; more strictly (usually a collective plural) to describe the <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">nine arkhons</xref></soCalled>; specifically, as the title of the senior of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">nine arkhonships</xref>. These were still the titular chief magistrates of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, but their real authority had been severely restricted ever since they began to be appointed by lot, apparently in the <dateRange from=\"-489\" to=\"-480\">480s</dateRange>. They retained however an honorific position, particularly in the administration of justice: or instance, former <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">arkhons</xref> became members of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"areopagus\">Areiopagos</xref> for life; and during their year of office they processed the litigation presented to the most important of the <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourts\">dikasteria</xref></term>, and presided over trials held there, although in this capacity they were by now little more than non-voting (and non-speaking) chairmen. The three senior <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"archons\">arkhons</xref> each had a specific title and competence: the <term>arkhon</term> (the eponymous official of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> who gave his name to the civil year) heard cases involving family and inheritance matters of citizens; the <term>arkhon basileus</term> (lit. <soCalled>king arkhon</soCalled>) presided over religious matters, including sacrilege and homicide; the <term>polemarkhos</term> (lit. <soCalled>war arkhon,</soCalled> but by now all his military functions had been handed over to the <term>strategoi</term>) dealt with family and inheritance cases involving metics and apparently cases involving certain other privileged foreigners also. The other six arkhons were called <term>thesmothetai</term> (sing. <term>thesmothetes</term>: originally perhaps <soCalled>establisher of judgements</soCalled> rather than <soCalled>maker of laws</soCalled>); they heard those public cases, and perhaps also some private ones, which did not fall within the competence of the three senior arkhons or of other named officials. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">a)/rxwn, a)/rxontes</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"astunomos\" n=\"astunomos\"> <head>astunomos</head>  <p><emph>astunomos</emph>, pl. <term>astunomoi</term> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>one who regulates (affairs within) the <term>astu</term> (the built-up area of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>).</soCalled> A board of public officials charged with the general supervisory duties which we associate with the police. Unlike the police, however, they did not undertake the investigation of crime. Nor were they much concerned with the arrest or punishment of accused or convicted criminals: this role was played by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@eleven\">Eleven</xref>. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">a)stuno/mos, a)stuno/moi</foreign>.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"atimia\" n=\"atimia\"> <head>atimia</head>  <p><emph>atimia</emph> (abstract noun) &#183; Lit. <soCalled>loss of <term>time</term>, honour.</soCalled> In early archaic <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, <term>atimia</term> seems to have meant outlawry, the total deprivation of all rights, such that a citizen could kill an <term>atimos</term> (pl. <term>atimoi</term>: person suffering from <term>atimia</term>) without committing an offence or apparently incurring blood-guilt. Well before the classical period, however, <term>atimia</term> had already been restricted in its scope to mean the loss of some or all of a man&#8217;s active rights as a citizen. Such <term>atimia</term> could be partial or total; it could be imposed permanently by a court, or it could be the (theoretically) temporary result of an unpaid debt to the state, a condition which would automatically terminate if the debt were ever paid off. A man subject to total <term>atimia</term> could not appear in certain public places, could not take part in public life, and could not appear in court. If he broke any of these bans, he was liable to <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@apagoge\"><term>apagoge</term></xref> and death. But he did retain his private rights as a citizen: to kill him would be murder; he was not formally exiled; and he continued to own his property&#8212;though his lack of the capacity to sue may have made it difficult procedurally to defend these rights, and many may have found life under such restrictions so intolerable that voluntary exile seemed preferable. A man subject to partial <term>atimia</term> lost either a particular right or rights, or else the power to exercise his rights in a particular situation: for instance, the ability to bring certain types of prosecution. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">a)timi/a</foreign> (loss of <foreign lang=\"grc\">timh/</foreign>).</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"basileus\" n=\"basileus\"> <head>basileus</head>  <p><emph>basileus</emph> See sv. arkhon.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">basileu/s</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"boule\" n=\"boule\"> <head>boule</head>  <p><emph>boule</emph> &#183; Lit. <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"council\">council</xref>.</soCalled> The democratic <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"council\">council</xref> of 500 men, appointed annually by lot from among citizens aged at least thirty, and with severe restrictions on repeated membership. Its chief function was to prepare the agenda for meetings of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"assembly\"><term>ekklesia</term></xref>, and to undertake certain routine administrative duties, in particular that of co-ordinating the activities of numerous boards of minor officials; but it had also certain independent judicial powers, mainly but not only in cases of limited importance: in some cases of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@eisangelia\"><term>eisangelia</term></xref>, the <term>boule</term> could decide whether to refer the trial to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"assembly\">ekklesia</xref> or to a <term>dikasterion</term>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">boulh/</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"boulomenos\" n=\"boulomenos\"> <head>(ho) boulomenos</head>  <p><emph>(ho) boulomenos</emph> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>anyone who wishes.</soCalled> Whereas prosecution in a <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@dike\">dike</xref></term> could only be brought by the aggrieved party, in a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@graphe\">graphe</xref> or other public case it could be brought by any qualified person (which normally meant any Athenian citizen who was not himself <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@atimia\"><term>atimos</term></xref>). </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">o( boulo/menos</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"diadikasia\" n=\"diadikasia\"> <head>diadikasia</head>  <p><emph>diadikasia</emph> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>judgement (contested) between</soCalled>: a dispute between two people who each claim the same thing, in particular a contested inheritance. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">diadikasi/a</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"diaitetes\" n=\"diaitetes\"> <head>diaitetes</head>  <p><emph>diaitetes</emph>, pl. <term>diaitetai</term> &#183; An arbitrator. Throughout the history of Athenian law, it had always been open for litigants to arrange arbitration (<term>diaita</term>) on a private basis: in theory, the decision of a private arbitrator was binding, presumably because the litigants had voluntarily contracted to accept it. There was also, however, a system of public arbitration, introduced <date value=\"-400\">c. 400 BCE</date>: every hoplite (or possibly every citizen), in the year that he ceased to be eligible for military service at the age of 59, had to serve as public arbitrator; and every <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@dike\">dike</xref> (private dispute) was allocated by lot to one of them for an attempt at preliminary resolution. In such cases arbitration was compulsory (litigants were obliged to attend) but it was not binding (a dissatisfied litigant could refuse to accept the verdict: see sv. <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@ephesis\"><term>ephesis</term></xref>). According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name>, the job of the arbitrator (private or public) is unlike that of the <term>dikastes</term> in several respects: he should try to reconcile the parties before imposing a solution; he has the discretion to bring in a decision mid-way between the demands of the litigants; and in his judgement he should look to epieikeia (<soCalled>equity,</soCalled> but see further sv. <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@epieikeia\"><term>epieikeia</term></xref>) rather than to <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@dike\">dike</xref> (<soCalled>justice</soCalled>). </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">diaithth/s, diaithtai/</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"diamarturia\" n=\"diamarturia\"> <head>diamarturia</head>  <p><emph>diamarturia</emph> &#183; A formal presentation of a witness (<term>martus</term>) whose evidence serves to compel the public official before whom it is presented either to act in a certain way, or (more commonly) to desist from so acting. As a result of the introduction of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@paragraphe\"><term>paragraphe</term></xref> around <date value=\"-400\">400</date> BCE, the scope of <term>diamarturia</term> was soon rapidly restricted: after <date value=\"-380\">380</date> BCE, its only attested use is in inheritance cases, where a legitimate son could have a claim by a more remote relative quashed on the grounds that the case was not actionable; to re-open the case, the rival claimant would have successfully to prosecute the witness by <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@pseudomarturion\"><term>dike pseudomarturion</term></xref>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">diamarturi/a</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"dike\" n=\"dike\"> <head>dike</head>  <p><emph>dike</emph>, pl. <term>dikai</term> &#183; A concept of wide scope: <soCalled>justice,</soCalled> <soCalled>good order,</soCalled> <soCalled>judgement.</soCalled> But it can also refer to the process by which a just settlement is determined, thus <soCalled>a lawsuit,</soCalled> <soCalled>a trial,</soCalled> and even <soCalled>the case which one pleads</soCalled> or <soCalled>the penalty which one has to pay.</soCalled> In the sence of <soCalled>lawsuit,</soCalled> <term>dike</term> can be used either generically, to refer to any type of indictment, or else (more commonly) in a semi-technical sense, to denote the older <soCalled>private suit</soCalled> (which only the aggrieved party or his immediate or his immediate personal representatives could bring) as opposed to the newer <soCalled>public suit</soCalled> (<xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@graphe\"><term>graphe</term></xref>), which could be brought by any citizen in good standing; it should however be noted that the category of public procedure was broader than that of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@graphe\"><term>graphe</term></xref>, and included a number of extraordinary procedures which were not themselves <term>graphai</term>, see for instance svv. <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@apagoge\"><term>apagoge</term></xref>, <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@apophasis\"><term>apophasis</term></xref>, <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@eisangelia\"><term>eisangelia</term></xref>, <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@euthunai\"><term>euthunai</term></xref>, <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@phasis\"><term>phasis</term></xref>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">di/kh, di/kai</foreign>.</p>  <p>Note: It seems that these indictments in Athenian law were only allowed if use of the dike or <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@graphe\"><term>graphe</term></xref> procedure against a particular offence was authorised by statute; whether the defendant&#8217;s alleged behavior fell within the terms of this offence could of course be a matter for debate. An indictment was normally described as a dike (or <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@graphe\"><term>graphe</term></xref>, as appropriate), qualified by the name of the offence, usually in the genitive case: thus <term>graphe hubreos</term>, a public indictment for <term>hubris</term>. </p> </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"diomosia\" n=\"diomosia\"> <head>diomosia</head>  <p><emph>diomosia</emph> &#183; A special oath taken in cases of homicide: in all other cases the litigants alone swore the <term>antimosia</term> (lit. <soCalled>oath [of two people] against each other</soCalled>); in homicide cases all the witnesses had to join in the oath of their principals, which was for this reason known as the <term>diomosia</term> (lit. <soCalled>oath between [more than two people]</soCalled>). </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">diwmosi/a</foreign>.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"dokimasia\" n=\"dokimasia\"> <head>dokimasia</head>  <p><emph>dokimasia</emph>, pl. <term>dokimasiai</term> &#183; An investigation held either by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"council\"><term>boule</term></xref> or in a court, to test whether a man was formally qualified either to hold the public office to which he had been appointed or else to exercise a privilege to which he was laying claim. <term>Dokimasiai</term> were of various types, and were for the most part held in advance: no public official, whether elected or appointed by lot, could hold office without having passed his <term>dokimasia</term>; and newly enrolled citizens, whether by birth or by naturalisation (uncommon), were among those similarly tested. In these cases a man who was rejected suffered disqualification but no further penalty; a public speaker however (see sv. <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@rhetor\"><term>rhetor</term></xref>) could be challenged to undergo a retroactive <term>dokimasia</term> before a court, and this had more of the nature of a regular trial, in that if convicted he would apparently be punished. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">dokimasi/a, dokimasi/ai</foreign>.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"eisangelia\" n=\"eisangelia\"> <head>eisangelia</head>  <p><emph>eisangelia</emph>, pl. <term>eisangeliai</term> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>public announcement, laying of information</soCalled>: a form of public indictment broadly corresponding to impeachment in the USA. It was available for use against any public official during or after his term of office (he would normally be suspended from office for the duration of the trial) or against any political leader who had made a public proposal. It seems that the case could be brought either directly to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"assembly\"><term>ekklesia</term></xref> or else to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"council\"><term>boule</term></xref>, and that the final hearing would take place either before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"assembly\"><term>ekklesia</term></xref> or (more commonly, and in every known case after <date value=\"-360\">360</date> B.C.) before a <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">dikasterion</xref></term>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">ei)saggeli/a, ei)saggeli/ai</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"ekdosis\" n=\"ekdosis\"> <head>ekdosis</head>  <p><emph>ekdosis</emph> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>giving forth</soCalled>: the ceremony at which the <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@kurios\">kurios</xref></term> of a betrothed bride gave her into the hand of her new husband.

Because of the urgency of the trade, such cases had rapid and privileged access to the courts; but it is not clear whether the term <term>emmenos</term>, commonly used to describe them, should be interpreted to mean that the case must be completed within a month (the traditional view), or (as has recently been argued) that there was an opportunity every month to initiate such cases; it is uncertain also whether such litigation could take place only during the summer months or only during the winter months. It is possible that other special rules may have applied in these cases. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">e)mporikh\\\\ di/kh, e)mporikai\\\\ di/kai</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"endeixis\" n=\"endeixis\"> <head>endeixis</head>  <p><emph>endeixis</emph>, pl. <term>endeixeis</term> &#183; A procedure closely related to <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@apagoge\"><term>apagoge</term></xref>. The precise significance of the term is disputed: traditionally it was thought to be a denunciation made before a public official who would then himself arrest the culprit; but it may instead have been used by the plaintiff in some cases as a voluntary preliminary to <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@apagoge\"><term>apagoge</term></xref>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">e)/ndeicis, e)ndei/ceis</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"engue\" n=\"engue\"> <head>engue</head>  <p><emph>engue</emph>, pl. <term>enguai</term>; <term>enguetes</term> &#183; A surety: the <term>engue</term> is the thing which is pledged as security, and the <term>enguetes</term> the person who pledges or commits himself as a pledge. Such sureties were used in a range of legal contexts: to guarantee the payment of a fine or the appearance of a defendant (particularly a foreigner) in court; and as a deposit payable to those who contracted from the state the right to collect taxes or to operate mining concessions. But the most notable use of <term>engue</term> was as the necessary prelude to <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@ekdosis\">ekdosis</xref></term> in the regular Athenian form of marriage, corresponding to (but much stronger than) the modern engagement. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">e)ggu/h, e)ggu/ai; e)gguhth/s</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"ephesis\" n=\"ephesis\"> <head>ephesis</head>  <p><emph>ephesis</emph> &#183; Refusal to accept the decision of an official or a court of first instance, combined with a demand for the dispute to be resolved by a higher authority. For instance, <name type=\"person\">Solon</name> in the <dateRange from=\"-599\" to=\"-590\">590s</dateRange> is said to have introduced <soCalled>ephesis to the dikasterion</soCalled> as a curb on the summary jurisdiction of public officials; and from their introduction in c. <date value=\"-400\">400</date> B.C., the decisions of public arbitrators were similarly subject to <term>ephesis</term>. <term>Ephesis</term> is traditionally translated <soCalled>appeal,</soCalled> but this can have misleading connotations. An appeal in English law is brought on the initiative of a dissatisfied litigant (in criminal cases, a convicted defendant) after the court of first instance has decided against him/her; it is his/her duty to persuade the appellate court to reverse the decision, and s/he becomes in a sense the plaintiff in the process. In <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, there were at least some situations in which <term>ephesis</term> could take place before the lower authority had reached a decision; it was the duty of the original plaintiff, not of the dissatisfied litigant, to persuade the court to act (that it, the court was retrying the case from scratch and not reviewing a decision already made); and it is possible that in the case of Solonian <term>ephesis</term>, this referral was automatic and did not depend on an initiative taken by one of the two litigants. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">e)/fesis</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"epieikeia\" n=\"epieikeia\"> <head>epieikeia</head>  <p><emph>epieikeia</emph> &#183; <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> says that it is the function of the <term>dikastes</term> (juror/judge) to judge according to <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@dike\">dike</xref></term> (<soCalled>justice</soCalled>), but that the <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@diaitetes\">diaitetes</xref></term> (arbitrator) should make his decision according to <term>epieikeia</term>. It is conventional therefore to translate <term>epieikeia</term> as <soCalled>equity,</soCalled> since this is a standard and convenient way to describe <soCalled>fairness</soCalled> or <soCalled>natural justice</soCalled> as opposed to the strict application of legal rules. There are however certain problems here. <soCalled>Equity</soCalled> in English law can mean simply <soCalled>fairness,</soCalled> but it is also the name given to the system of law developed originally by the Court of Chancery (the Lord Chancellor&#8217;s court), to provide relief in cases where to apply the rules of the common law would have seemed manifestly unfair. <soCalled>Equity</soCalled> in this sense is itself a body of rules; it is found only in countries which base their legal system on the common law; and it is clearly not what <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> is talking about. It should indeed be noted that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name>&#8217;s statement of theory receives little acknowledgment in Athenian practice: when a litigant in an extant speech pleads for the application of natural justice in his favour, he characteristically describes this as <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@dike\">dike</xref></term> and not as <term>epieikeia</term>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">e)piei/keia</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"epikleros\" n=\"epikleros\"> <head>epikleros</head>  <p><emph>epikleros</emph> (fem. adj. acting as noun), <term>epiklerote</term> (abstract noun) &#183; An <term>epikleros</term> was the daughter of a man who died leaving no male heir; she was not his heiress, but possession of his estate went together with her hand in marriage.

The examination was conducted by boards of <term>logistai</term> (pl.) and <term>euthunoi</term> (pl.), as appropriate; but any private citizen could bring a charge at any stage during the proceedings. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">eu)qu/nh, eu)/qunai</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"exegetes\" n=\"exegetes\"> <head>exegetes</head>  <p><emph>exegetes</emph>, pl. <term>exegetai</term> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>interpreter.</soCalled> A group of officials who expound the proper procedure in situations which raise unusual questions of religious law. Their activity is attested in several cases, all of homicide; and in each case they are responding to an inquiry by an individual by an individual rather than as expert witnesses before a court. In one case they offer also to advise a litigant, implying that this was something more than their regular function of interpreting the law. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">e)chghth/s, e)chghtai/</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"graphe\" n=\"graphe\"> <head>graphe</head>  <p><emph>graphe</emph>, pl. <term>graphai</term> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>a writing</soCalled>; hence, <soCalled>a written indictment,</soCalled> cf.

Its characteristic was that the indictment could be brought by any qualified citizen (<term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@boulomenos\">ho boulomenos</xref></term>), whereas the older <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@dike\">dike</xref></term> procedure could be brought only by the injured party. <term>Graphai</term> and other public procedures appear to have given rise to higher penalties, and thus to have rewarded a successful plaintiff much more heavily than did <term>dikai</term>; but they were also considerably more risky: a plaintiff in a public suit who failed to obtain 20 per cent of the votes of the jury could expect to suffer a heavy fine and possibly also other penalties (e.g. at least partial <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@atimia\">atimia</xref></term>). </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">grafh/, grafai/</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"klepsudra\" n=\"klepsudra\"> <head>klepsudra</head>  <p><emph>klepsudra</emph> &#183; Lt. <soCalled>water-stealer.</soCalled> A water-clock, used to regulate the length of the proceedings in legal cases. It consisted of a bowl of water with a small hole near the base, such that the hole could be stopped or opened as desired: normally two such bowls were used, the one being allowed to empty its contents into the other, and then vice versa, to measure the passage of time. In any category of case, a set number of bowls-full was allocated to each speaker, but the flow of water was stopped for the reading of laws and the testimony of witness. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">kleyu/dra</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"kurios\" n=\"kurios\"> <head>kurios</head>  <p><emph>kurios</emph> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>master,</soCalled> <soCalled>lord,</soCalled> or in certain contexts <soCalled>sovereign.</soCalled> An Athenian woman had to be represented in legal transactions by a male relative, who was described as her <term>kurios</term>: in the case of an unmarried girl or widow who had returned to the house of her family, this would normally be her father or (failing him) her brother or paternal uncle, but it could even be her adult son. A married woman was represented by her husband, but it appears that her agnatic <term>kurios</term> did retain certain rights: for instance, the reversion of her dowry. Confusingly, the term <term>kurios</term> was also used to denote the owner of property or the master of a household, and there are contexts in which the two uses might conflict: a married son, for instance, would be <term>kurios</term> of his wife; but his father may still be <term>kurios</term> of his household. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">ku/rios</foreign>.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"logographos\" n=\"logographos\"> <head>logographos</head>  <p><emph>logographos</emph>, pl. <term>logographoi</term> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>speech-writer</soCalled>: specifically, a professional writer of speeches for litigants to deliver in court.

The precise arrangements for the process seem to have been revised several times during the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">fourth century</dateRange>; but it is notable that the <term>nomothetai</term> were a body selected by lot from among the panel of eligible <term>dikastai</term>.

The child of an unmarried union between citizen and non-citizen was clearly illegitimate, and had rights neither of inheritance nor of <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"citizenship\">citizenship</xref>. The status of the child of unmarried citizen parents is less clear: such a person was clearly a <term>nothos</term> without rights of inheritance, but it is disputed whether s/he was or was not a citizen. It is possible, though less certain, that the word <term>nothos</term> was used to describe the child of a mixed marriage even in those contexts (e.g. before <date value=\"-450\">450</date> BCE) where such a marriage was legally permissible, even though such a child might have full rights to inheritance as well as to <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"citizenship\">citizenship</xref>. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">no/qos, no/qoi</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"oikos\" n=\"oikos\"> <head>oikos</head>  <p><emph>oikos</emph> &#183; A household: the word can be used to describe people or family property or a building, or all three together. The term is rarely used in the formulation of Athenian statutes, but the concept seems to play an important r&#244;le not only in family but in <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"citizenship\">citizenship</xref> law: see svv. <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@kurios\">kurios</xref></term>, <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@nothos\">nothos</xref></term>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">oi)=kos</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"paragraphe\" n=\"paragraphe\"> <head>paragraphe</head>  <p><emph>paragraphe</emph> &#183; A counter-indictment, in which the defendant charges the plaintiff with bringing an illegal prosecution. The procedure was invented (or possibly re-organised) around <date value=\"-400\">400</date>, to help those threatened with charges which broke the Amnesty: the latter had been imposed under Spartan supervision to protect former supporters of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"thirty tyrants\">Thirty Tyrants</xref>, the oligarchic junta of <dateRange from=\"-404\" to=\"-403\">404/3</dateRange> which had been overthrown by the democratic restoration of <dateRange from=\"-403\" to=\"-402\">403/2</dateRange>. <term>Paragraphe</term>, however rapidly extended its scope: for the defendant, it seems to have had the advantage that it was itself a prosecution; whereas the older procedure of <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@diamarturia\">diamarturia</xref></term> simply served to block a particular claim by the plaintiff, <term>paragraphe</term> enabled the defendant to turn the tables, becoming himself the prosecutor and (if successful) imposing a penalty on his opponent. </p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">paragrafh/</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"paranomon\" n=\"paranomon\"> <head>(graphe) paranomon</head>  <p><emph>(graphe) paranomon</emph> &#183; A public indictment against the proposer of a new <term>psephisma</term> (decree), charging that his proposal is unconstitutional (lit. <soCalled>against the law</soCalled>): One of the most extensively documented of all Athenian legal procedures, and one of the most overtly political: the prosecutor might claim for instance that the bill had been proposed without the necessary formalities; but many of the extant <term>graphai paranomon</term> are directed against honorary decrees, and in these the prosecutor regularly bases his case on the claim that the honour is itself undeserved. The procedure could be employed against proposals both before and after they had been voted on by the <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"assembly\">ekklesia</xref></term>. Until <date value=\"-403\">403</date> B.C., it was apparently used without discrimination against both <term>nomoi</term> (laws) and <term>psephismata</term>; but in that year a formal distinction was for the first time drawn between the two types of statute (see sv. <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"law_glossary@nomos\">nomos</xref></term>, <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"legislation\">Legislation</xref>). The old procedure of <term>graphi paranomon</term> was retained for use against <term>psephismata</term>; but a new parallel procedure, the <term>graphi nomon me epitedeion theinai</term>, was felt to be required for use against unconstitutional (lit. <soCalled>inexpedient</soCalled>) <term>nomoi</term>.</p>  <p>Greek: <foreign lang=\"grc\">grafh\\\\ parano/nwn</foreign>.</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"section\" id=\"phasis\" n=\"phasis\"> <head>phasis</head>  <p><emph>phasis</emph> &#183; Lit. <soCalled>a showing forth, declaration</soCalled>: denunciation of a man who is illegally withholding property which belongs to the state.

This vote of the <term><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"assembly\">ekklesia</xref></term> had no formal effect: it did not bind a successful plaintiff to continue his action in court, nor apparently did it prevent him from doing so if unsuccessful; it imposed no penalty either on plaintiff or on defendant. It did however strengthen the hand of the successful plaintiff: after the manner of a straw poll, it showed which way the wind was blowing.
