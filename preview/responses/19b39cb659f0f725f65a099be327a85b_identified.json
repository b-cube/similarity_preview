Fire Departments not having a permanent location are included, in which case their location has been depicted at the city/town hall or at the center of their service area if a city/town hall does not exist. This dataset includes those locations primarily engaged in forest or grasslands fire fighting, including fire lookout towers if the towers are in current use for fire protection purposes. This dataset includes both private and governmental entities. Fire fighting training academies are also included.  TGS verified the name, physical street address, city, state, five digit zip code, phone number, and location through phone contact.  No other state provided information was verified.  Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.  All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.  The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 10/16/2006 and the newest record dates from 11/10/2006.</abstract> <purpose>Homeland Security  Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.  1. An assessment of whether or not the total fire fighting capability in a given area is adequate.  2. A list of resources to draw upon by surrounding areas when local resources have temporarily been overwhelmed by a disaster - route analysis can determine those entities that are able to respond the quickest.  3. A resource for Emergency Management planning purposes.  4. A resource for catastrophe response to aid in the retrieval of equipment by outside responders in order to deal with the disaster.  5. A resource for situational awareness planning and response for Federal Government events.</purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20061016</begdate> <enddate>20061110</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Unknown</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc> -102.010477</westbc> <eastbc> -94.611579</eastbc> <northbc> 39.998808</northbc> <southbc> 37.002604</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>LCSH - Library of Congress subject headings (Washington, DC: LC, Cataloging Distribution Service) http://authorities.loc.gov/</themekt> <themekey>Fire stations</themekey> <themekey>Fire departments</themekey> <themekey>Emergency</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>structure</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>LCSH - Library of Congress subject headings (Washington, DC: LC, Cataloging Distribution Service) http://authorities.loc.gov/</placekt> <placekey>Kansas</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>None</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Mike Thompson</cntper> <cntorg>Techni Graphic Systems, Inc.</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>Director of Geospatial Datasets</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing and Physical Address</addrtype> <address>2000 Noble Drive</address> <city>Wooster</city> <state>OH</state> <postal>44691</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>330-263-6222</cntvoice> <cntfax>330-263-6294</cntfax> <cntemail>mthompson@tgstech.com</cntemail> <hours>8am - 5pm, Monday - Friday, Eastern Time</hours> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <secinfo> <secsys>DOD</secsys> <secclass>Unclassified</secclass> <sechandl>Unclassified</sechandl> </secinfo> <native>Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.6.1500</native> </idinfo> <dataqual> <attracc> <attraccr>For entities that were contacted, the name, address, city, state, and five (5) digit zip codes were verified to be correct as of the date indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. The existence of the entity was also verified, as well as whether it met the criteria for inclusion in this dataset. Four (4) digit zip code extensions were derived from USPS (United States Postal Service) data and were not verified.  ID Check: IDs are not blank or duplicated.  Coordinate Check: Coordinates are not null or zero and the x and y fields match the shape.  Basic Address Check: Physical addresses were verified to be non blank and to not be a \"PO Box\", \"General Delivery\", \"Highway Contract\", or \"Rural Route\" address.  Highway Address without Type Check: Physical addresses containing the word \"Highway\" or \"Route\" were verified to also contain a type designator such as \"State\", \"US\", or \"County\". These type designators are often missing from addresses, leading to confusion if more than one \"Highway\" of the given number exists in an area.  Basic Name Check: Entity name is not blank or same as entity city and has a minimum of 2 characters. Name does not contain punctuation characters that can interfere with database operations, such as \" (quote) and * (asterisk).  Basic Phone Check: All phone numbers are ten (10) numeric digits. Alphabetic characters have been converted to the corresponding numeric digit.  County FIPS to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular FIPS Code attribute is actually in the state specified by the state attribute.  County Name to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular county name attribute is actually in the state specified by the state attribute.  Phone Number Format Check: Phone numbers (including area code) were verified to be formatted as nnn-nnn-nnnn.  NPA_NXX Check: Area codes (sometimes called \"Number Planning Areas\", or NPA's) and central office codes (sometimes known as exchanges, or NXX's) were validated against data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA). In some cases NPA-NXX combinations did not show up in the NANPA data but were verified to work.  Zip Code Check: The zip code is five (5) or nine (9) numeric digits, is listed in the postal database, is in the same state as indicated by the entity's [STATE] attribute, and is not a PO Box only zip code.  Zip City Check: The entity's zip code and city were verified to match according to the USPS Address Information System (AIS).  Collocation Check: Entities with different addresses must not share the exact same geospatial location.  Geographic Spell Check: Words that appear in the entity name were checked against a standard English word list (and Spanish word list for entities in Puerto Rico). Words not appearing in the standard word lists were then checked against names appearing in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) and located within 25 miles of the entity. Proper names were manually reviewed for correct spelling.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>See the \"Attribute_Accuracy_Report\" section.

Some areas do not have regular city style addressing, so entities may not have a street number. In such cases, the name of the road they are located on is listed in this attribute.</attrdef> <attrdefs>TGS</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Text</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>ADDRESS2</attrlabl> <attrdef>Location within physical address, i.e. floor, suite, building.</attrdef> <attrdefs>TGS</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Text</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>CITY</attrlabl> <attrdef>The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a \"City\" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address, but recognizes the location (i.e. they list the location as \"undeliverable\"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city; rather, they list the city as having \"General Delivery\". In these cases the city and associated zip code is acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] attribute will contain a street address, not \"general delivery\"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the \"City\" specified in its city field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases the \"city\" that appears in this attribute may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable \"city\" to the USPS. An example of this is \"Notre Dame, IN\". There is no city in Indiana called \"Notre Dame\", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to Notre Dame University, which is actually located in the city of South Bend. \"Notre Dame\", like most USPS cities is an easily recognized place, gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality the USPS \"city\" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable \"city\" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.  Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.</attrdef> <attrdefs>TGS</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Text</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>STATE</attrlabl> <attrdef>Two (2) character abbreviation for state associated with the entity's physical address.

The \"Index Entries\" that appear on the NAICS webpage (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) are being used to populate this attribute as opposed to the \"NAICS Title\". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and \"NAICS Titles\", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the \"Index Entries\". By using the \"Index Entries\", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these \"Index Entries\". The \"Index Entries\" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus there are often two or more \"Index Entries\" that are synonyms, for example: \"Prisons\" and \"Penitentiaries\". In cases like this we have standardized on one \"Index Entry\".  NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset. On the other hand, HSIP Themes are assigned based upon the function that qualified an entity for inclusion in this dataset. It is possible that if an entity appears in more than one dataset it will have a different HSIP Theme in each dataset, but it should have the same NAICS Code and NAICS Description in each case.</attrdef> <attrdefs>TGS</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>FIRE DEPARTMENTS (E.G., GOVERNMENT, VOLUNTEER (EXCEPT PRIVATE))</edomv> <edomvd>FIRE DEPARTMENTS (E.G., GOVERNMENT, VOLUNTEER (EXCEPT PRIVATE)) - [NAICS Code 922160]: Entities that are involved in fire fighting are classified under this description, unless they are privately owned, are primarily involved in forest fire fighting, or also operate a rescue service.</edomvd> <edomvds>TGS</edomvds> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>FIRE AND RESCUE SERVICE</edomv> <edomvd>FIRE AND RESCUE SERVICE - [NAICS Code 922160]: Entities that are involved in fire fighting and rescue service are classified under this description, unless they are privately owned, or are primarily involved in forest fire fighting.</edomvd> <edomvds>TGS</edomvds> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>AMBULANCE AND FIRE SERVICE COMBINED</edomv> <edomvd>AMBULANCE AND FIRE SERVICE COMBINED - [NAICS Code 922160]: Entities providing ambulance services with fire protection service.</edomvd> <edomvds>TGS</edomvds> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>FIRE FIGHTER TRAINING SCHOOLS</edomv> <edomvd>FIRE FIGHTER TRAINING SCHOOLS - [NAICS Code 611519]: Entities that are primarily involved in training fire fighters are classified under this description.</edomvd> <edomvds>TGS</edomvds> </edom> </attrdomv> </attr> </detailed> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Data Access and Support Center (DASC)</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address>1930 Constant Avenue</address> <city>Lawrence</city> <state>Kansas</state> <postal>66047-3726</postal> <country>USA</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>785-864-2000</cntvoice> <cntfax>785-864-5317</cntfax> <cntemail>dasc@kgs.ku.edu</cntemail> <hours>0800-1700</hours> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc> <distliab>The State of Kansas Geographic Information Systems Core Database's digital data have been tested and their documentation carefully reviewed.
