You can <strong><a href=\"https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk\">register to vote online</a></strong> at any time after your 16th birthday, although you won't be able to vote until you are 18. It's a good idea to register as early as you can to make sure that you can vote when the election happens.</p> <p>You'll need your National Insurance Number to register to vote.</p> <p>Students can register both at home and in the place where they are studying. They can vote in local elections in both areas, but it's illegal to vote in both areas in a general election.</p> <p>When you register, you'll be asked if you want to appear on the 'open register'. This is a list of the names and addresses of registered voters which anyone can buy. Appearing on the open register might mean you get more junk mail.</p> <p>You'll also be asked if you want to apply for a postal vote. Saying 'yes' won't automatically mean you can vote by post. You'll be sent an application form, which you'll need to complete and send back to get your postal vote.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.registertovote.service.gov.uk\">Register to vote.</a></strong></p> <h2>How to vote</h2> <p>There are three ways to vote:</p> <ul> <li><strong>In person</strong>, at a polling station</li> <li><strong>By post</strong>, if you apply for a postal vote in advance</li> <li><strong>By nominating someone else</strong> to go to the polling station for you</li> </ul> <h3>Voting in person</h3> <p>In the run-up to the election, you should receive a polling card through the post. This tells you where the polling station (the place you go to vote) is. It will normally be a public building, like a school, town hall or church. The polling station will be open from 7am to 10pm on the day of the election, but if you arrive near to closing time and there is a queue, you might not be able to vote.</p> <p>You don't need to take anything with you to vote, but you can take your polling card to show who you are. The polling station staff will ask for your name and address and give you the voting papers for the elections that are taking place.</p> <p>You'll go into a polling booth to fill in your papers. This makes sure that nobody else can see how you vote. Each paper will have instructions on how to fill it in: make sure you follow these carefully, or your vote might not count.</p> <p>When you've filled in your paper, you put it into the ballot box. If there is more than one election, you'll put each paper in a different box, so make sure you match them up properly. They will normally be colour-coded to make this easier.</p> <h3>Voting by post</h3> <p>You can choose to vote by post. If you do, you will be sent your voting papers in advance. You'll need to fill them in at home along with a special form, then post them back using a provided envelope. It's important to post your vote as quickly as possible to make sure it arrives on time, but if you leave it too late, you can take it to the polling station on election day instead.</p> <p>Anyone can vote by post \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd you don't need to give a reason. You can <strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote\">download an application form online</a></strong>.</p> <h2>Voting by proxy</h2> <p>In some situations, you can get somebody else to vote for you. This could be an option if you won't be in the country or you have a medical problem that makes it difficult to get to the polling station.</p> <p>You'll need to <strong><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/apply-vote-proxy\">fill in a form</a></strong> to do this. Do this as early as possible to make sure your application is dealt with on time \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd at least a week before election day.</p> <p>Anyone who is registered and allowed to vote can be your proxy, but it should be someone who you can trust.</p> <h2>Types of election</h2> <p>There are a number of different kinds of election that you might participate in. These will often be scheduled on the same day, so you'll vote in more than one kind of election at once. Make sure you check which elections are taking place well in advance so you can decide who you want to vote for.</p> <h3>General elections</h3> <p>In a general election, you vote to decide who your MP will be. This decides who makes up the government. You'll get a list of the candidates' names and which political party they are standing for, and you can place a single vote for one candidate. Whoever gets the most votes will be the MP for your area.</p> <p>General elections normally take place every five years.</p> <h3>Local elections</h3> <p>In local elections, you'll vote to decide who sits on your local council. The system is mostly the same as general elections, but you might be able to vote for more than one candidate: check the instructions on your ballot paper carefully.</p> <p>In some areas, you'll also vote for a mayor. In mayoral elections, you'll get to pick a first and second choice, instead of simply picking a single candidate.</p> <p>How often local elections happen depends on where you live, but it will be at least once every four years.</p> <h3>European elections</h3> <p>In European elections, you vote for an MEP to represent you in the European Parliament. Instead of voting for a single candidate, you rank the candidates in order of preference. More than one candidate from each area will be elected, so there might be more than one candidate for the same political party.</p> <p>European elections take place every five years.</p> <h3>By-elections</h3> <p>A by-election is held when an MP, councillor or MEP needs to be elected outside the usual elections. This might happen because they have died or resigned, or because there was a problem with the election. By-elections work in the same way as the normal elections, but they won't be on a regular schedule.</p> <h3>Referendums</h3> <p>A referendum isn't technically an election: instead of being asked to choose between different candidates, you're asked to vote on a particular proposal, such as changing the voting system or the structure of the government. Referendums normally work in the same way as elections, but some of the rules about who can vote may be different. For example, in the Scottish independence referendum in 2014, the voting age was 16 instead of 18.</p> <p>Make sure you read the question on the paper carefully: if it isn't clearly phrased, you can end up voting the opposite way to the one you intended.</p> <h2>Related links</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/practical-advice/trade-unions-explained\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Trade unions explained</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/studying-at-university/getting-involved-with-your-student-union\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Getting involved with your student union</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/practical-advice/where-can-i-go-for-legal-advice\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Where can I go for legal advice?</a></strong></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>MarkTaylor</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-18T12:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Article</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/practical-advice/could-text-messages-get-more-students-voting\">     <title>Could text messages get more students voting?</title>     <link>http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/practical-advice/could-text-messages-get-more-students-voting</link>     <description>Text messages will remind students to register to vote when they arrive on campus.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/kikishua/5708302436\"><img src=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/practical-advice/could-text-messages-get-more-students-voting/@@images/1a0fbd91-fab8-40e5-8b8a-b44c3e9314a1.jpeg\" alt=\"Could text messages get more students voting?\" class=\"image-right\" title=\"Photo by Crishna Simmons CC BY-NC\" /></a>Text messages will remind students to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote\">register to vote</a> when they arrive on campus.</strong></p> <p>Using a system more often used to persuade people to pop into a shop as they pass, the Electoral Commission plans to send a text to students when they enter certain areas near their university.</p> <p>A change made last year means that everyone now has to register to vote individually, instead of as part of a household.

These include:</p> <ul> <li>Work experience, especially if it's highly relevant to the job</li> <li>Having a good understanding of the organization and the industry</li> <li>Being able to demonstrate 'soft skills' like time management and communication</li> <li>Giving specific examples of things you have achieved, rather than just describing your strengths and skills.</li> </ul> <p>Find out more about how to impress with your <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/cv-writing-skills\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">CV</a></strong>, <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/how-to-write-a-cover-letter\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">cover letter</a></strong> and <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/how-to-fill-in-a-job-application-form\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">application form</a></strong>, as well as <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/interview-tips-and-tricks\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">how to stand out at a job interview</a></strong>.</p> <h2>Do employers prefer long-term voluntary work or a wider range of work for a shorter time?</h2> <p>There is no fixed answer to this. What really matters is what you experience and achieve during your work, and how relevant it is to the job you are applying for. A long period of volunteering gives you the opportunity to achieve more and develop different skills, such as planning, but there's a risk that you could end up repeating the same kind of work instead of pursuing new experiences.</p> <p>A long-term commitment that doesn't take up too much time, such as volunteering once a week, can help you to get some of the benefits while still having time for other, shorter work experience opportunities.</p> <h2>Is the importance of a degree decreasing with extremely high tuition fees or increasing?</h2> <p>So far, higher fees don't seem to have made much difference to the number of people going to university, which suggests there won't be much impact on competition for graduate jobs.</p> <p>The other side of the question is whether getting a degree is still worth it financially. This is a little bit complicated because of the way the repayments system works. After you graduate, 9% of your earnings over \\ufffd\\ufffd21,000 go towards repaying your student loan. If you earn less than \\ufffd\\ufffd21,000, you don't repay anything. This figure was increased when fees went up, so when you first start work you'll actually have more money in your pocket than under the old fees system. However, if you earn enough to repay a decent amount of your loan, you'll end up paying more in the long run.</p> <p>Ultimately, though, comparing the new system to the old one isn't what matters: after all, you can't go back in time to the days before fees. Instead, you need to consider how university study compares to the other options available, such as apprenticeships, which don't involve fees and allow you to earn a wage while you are studying. <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/a-levels/whats-next-after-a-levels\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Find out more about your options after A-level.</a></strong></p> <h2>What makes individuals stand out on a CV if they all have the appropriate qualifications and work experience?</h2> <p>While qualifications and work experience are the core of your CV, you can include other achievements if they are relevant to the job. For example, if you were part of a sports team, you could mention this as a demonstration of your teamwork skills. If you have taught yourself a valuable skill, such as programming, you can mention this even if you don't have a formal qualification.</p> <p>But making your CV stand out isn't just about what you have done: it's also about the way you present it. You need to think carefully about how your qualifications and experience make you the best candidate for the job you're applying for, and highlight those things on your CV. Try to mention specific things you have achieved rather than just describing your strengths and skills.</p> <p>Finally, make sure you avoid <strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/90-of-cvs-are-full-of-blunders\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">common CV mistakes</a></strong> to make sure that your hard work doesn't go to waste.</p> <h2>Would you say a sandwich degree gives students a better chance of getting a job after their degree? Or does it make no difference, as long as the candidates have relevant work experience?</h2> <p>If you have the same level of work experience, it's unlikely that employers will be all that interested in whether it was a part of your course or done separately. However, you might struggle to obtain the same amount of experience as you would get on a sandwich course if you're doing it independently. Universities often have close ties to industries which can get you a high-quality, structured placement for a full year. Gaining significant work experience during your course can also help you to direct your studies during the rest of your time at university.</p> <p>There are also financial differences. Students doing a year in industry can still get a maintenance loan to help with their living costs, although this is at a reduced rate of \\ufffd\\ufffd2,347. On some kinds of unpaid placement, you can get your full student finance package. Some universities also offer bursaries or scholarships which students doing a year in industry can qualify for. All of this can make getting work experience much more affordable.</p> <h2>Do employers prefer graduate entry medical students as they have two degrees or those who have just completed the five year MBBS course?</h2> <p>Unless your undergraduate degree is especially relevant to the position you're applying for, it shouldn't make much difference. Your work experience and skills are likely to be more important.</p> <p>Studying medicine will really help you get a job: it has the highest employment rate of any subject.</p> <h2>Related links</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/landing-that-dream-job\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Landing that dream job</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/how-to-kickstart-your-career-while-you-study-1\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">How to kickstart your career while you study</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/career-pathways/jobhunting-tips/improve-your-job-prospects-in-10-minutes\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Improve your job prospects in 10 minutes</a></strong></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>MarkTaylor</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-13T16:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Article</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/apprenticeships/what-can-an-apprenticeship-give-you-that-other-courses-cant\">     <title>What can an apprenticeship give you that other courses can't?</title>     <link>http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/apprenticeships/what-can-an-apprenticeship-give-you-that-other-courses-cant</link>     <description>Apprenticeships develop skills you can't get on an academic course, according to a survey of business leaders.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/niexecutive/8744051876\"><img src=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/apprenticeships/what-can-an-apprenticeship-give-you-that-other-courses-cant/@@images/064269c5-29b8-41a6-8771-dfb15424f142.jpeg\" alt=\"What can an apprenticeship give you that other courses can't?\" class=\"image-right\" title=\"Photo by Northern Ireland Executive CC BY-ND\" /></a>Apprenticeships develop skills you can't get on an academic course, according to a survey of business leaders.</strong></p> <p>77% said that apprentices gain skills that can only be learned in a work environment, while almost half said that apprenticeships are a faster and more cost-effective way to start your career than getting a degree.</p> <p>Apprenticeships combine a paid job with training leading to a recognised qualification.

Find out about funding for overseas courses.</strong></p> <h3>UK loans and grants</h3> <p>If you do your whole degree abroad, you won't be able to access the loans and grants that you would get in the UK. You can get these if you do a year abroad during a UK-based degree. <a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/studying-at-university/going-abroad-during-your-degree\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\"><strong>Find out more about going abroad during your degree</strong>.</a></p> <h3>Other funding</h3> <p>Funding to do a full degree abroad is more difficult to find than for UK-based courses with a year abroad. This is because universities will often support their students if they want to spend time in another country \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd but if you're doing your entire course overseas, this isn't an option.</p> <p>The funding you can get will depend on the country you are going to, the subject you are studying and even the specific institution you study at. The main sources of funding are:</p> <ul> <li>UK or international organizations that promote international study</li> <li>The government of the country you are going to</li> <li>The university you apply to</li> </ul> <p>If you're studying in Europe, you can find out about the available funding from the <strong><a href=\"http://www.european-funding-guide.eu\">European Funding Guide</a></strong>.</p> <p>If you're studying in the USA, you can find out more about the available funding from the <strong><a href=\"http://www.fulbright.org.uk/\">Fulbright Commission</a></strong>.</p> <p>The <strong><a href=\"http://www.britishcouncil.org/study-work-create/practicalities/funding-studies\">British Council</a></strong> has information on other sources of funding.</p> <h3>Working while abroad</h3> <p>There will be restrictions on the work you can do while you are studying in another country. These vary from place to place and can be complex. For example, in the USA you will normally only be able to get a job if it is on campus, part of a training course, or if you can show that you are in financial trouble for reasons beyond your control.</p> <p>If you do work that isn't allowed by your visa, you could be arrested or deported, so make sure you are certain of the work restrictions before you look for a job.</p> <h3>Tuition fees</h3> <p>How much you pay in tuition fees will depend on where you study. They vary widely, from as much as \\ufffd\\ufffd28,000 at some US universities to free in parts of Germany. Universities that don't charge fees might charge an administration or registration fee, usually of a few hundred pounds.</p> <p>Within the EU, you'll be charged the same fees as a home student, although if there is support available for the cost of fees you may not qualify. In other countries, you might be charged a higher rate, so make sure you confirm the cost for international students with the university directly.</p> <h3>Related links</h3> <ul> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/choosing-a-university/studying-a-university-course-abroad\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Studying a university course abroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/applying-to-university/applying-for-a-university-course-abroad\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Applying for a university course abroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/studying-at-university/going-abroad-during-your-degree\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\"><span>Going abroad during your degree</span></a></strong></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>MarkTaylor</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-12T15:14:38Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Article</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/applying-to-university/applying-for-a-university-course-abroad\">     <title>Applying for a university course abroad</title>     <link>http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/applying-to-university/applying-for-a-university-course-abroad</link>     <description>Find out how to apply if you want to study outside the UK.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/4867951888\"><img src=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/applying-to-university/applying-for-a-university-course-abroad/@@images/c9149a5e-4339-40f1-9206-8a2f75c6d115.jpeg\" alt=\"Applying for a university course abroad\" class=\"image-right\" title=\"Photo by Wally Gobetz CC BY-NC-ND\" /></a><strong>F</strong><strong>ind out how to apply if you want to study outside the UK.</strong></p> <h3><span style=\"color: black; \">The application process</span></h3> <p><span><span>Some European universities are being brought into the UCAS system, allowing you to apply for them in the same way you would a UK university. For most, though, you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdll have to contact the universities directly to find out how to apply. Do this early, because you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdll also need to know whether they will recognise your current UK qualifications, or whether you need to study any additional courses or qualifications before you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdre eligible. Plus, bear in mind that certain countries \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd such as the USA \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd charge students to apply to university, so you\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdll need to find about any costs like this in advance.</span></span></p> <p>Application forms are normally similar to the UCAS form, requiring your exam results, a personal statment and a reference. Remember, you might also have to go to an interview \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd more difficult if it means travelling a long way!</p> <p>Application deadlines can also differ in different countries, so check this well in advance.</p> <p>Remember, you can still apply for courses in the UK if you are applying overseas. However, you won't be able to use a UK application as an 'insurance' choice to back up a conditional offer outside the UCAS system.</p> <h3>Entry requirements</h3> <p>Most universities will accept A-levels or the International Baccalaureate. However, their requirements may be different to what you would expect in the UK: for example, they may only accept A-levels taken at the same time as each other, and may require certain subjects regardless of what you want to study at university.</p> <p>If your course isn't in English, you'll normally need a qualification to show that you can speak the langauge well enough to follow the course. Make sure you check what is required before you apply.</p> <h3>Related links</h3> <ul> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/choosing-a-university/studying-a-university-course-abroad\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Studying a university course abroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/money/student-finance/funding-a-university-course-abroad\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Funding a university course abroad</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title=\"\" href=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/studying-at-university/going-abroad-during-your-degree\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Going abroad during your degree</a></strong></li> </ul> <ul></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>MarkTaylor</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-12T15:14:43Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Article</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/choosing-a-university/worlds-most-respected-universities\">     <title>Which are the world's most respected universities?</title>     <link>http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/choosing-a-university/worlds-most-respected-universities</link>     <description>UK universities rise up a poll of academics compiled to discover the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds most respected universities.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><strong><img src=\"http://www.brightknowledge.org/knowledge-bank/education-pathways/choosing-a-university/450pxHarvard_college__science_center.jpg/@@images/a6084eb1-3c76-4980-b601-023b1c3b25e9.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"image-right\" title=\"\" />UK universities rise up a poll of academics compiled to discover the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds most respected universities. </strong></p> <p>An annual\\ufffd\\ufffdpoll conducted by the <a href=\"http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk\" class=\"external-link\"><strong>Times Higher Education Supplement</strong> </a>has revealed the 100 universities with the best reputations in the world.
