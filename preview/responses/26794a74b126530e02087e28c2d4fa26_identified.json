Possible titles                     for this role might be something like \"Community Technical Officer\"  or                     \"Community Outreach Coordinator\". In this proposal we will refer to this                     position as the COC.</p>                                         <p> In this proposal we envision this as a volunteer position, on the theory                     that if the TEI chooses to fund this activity the money is better spent                     on grants to projects as described in the COP proposal. However, if the                     program overall is a success we may find that in a few years there is                     both need and funding to permit this to be a paid position. Some                     additional activities and responsibilities are described at the end that                     could be added if this role expands.</p>                                          <p>As currently envisioned the position is roughly at a part with the SIG                     Coordinator in its level of responsibility and time commitment. It might                     be desirable to appoint two co-coordinators.  The COC would be appointed                     by the TEI Board of Directors</p>                                          <p>The role of the COC is to coordinate the TEI's Community Outreach                     Program, to ensure that queries and requests for assistance are answered                     promptly and that members of the TEI community are able to get advice,                     consultation, and assistance in developing grant proposals.</p>                                         <p> Specific responsibilities and activities include:                     <list><item>maintaining a current set of consultant listings</item>                     <item>recruiting consultants who represent a broad range of expertise and a                     variety of languages so to support as much of the TEI community as possible</item>                     <item>publicizing the COP and its grants program</item>                     <item>serving as point of contact for queries about TEI consultancy, the                     outreach program, grant assistance</item>                     <item>issuing call for proposals for the consultancy grant program and                     managing whatever proposal review process is established</item>                     <item>once a year, compiling reports from grant program for the TEI to be                     shared at the TEI members meeting (and in whatever other venues are                     appropriate)</item>                     <item>help consultants and projects publish the results of their work                     (customizations, tools, etc.) on the TEI web site or wiki, as appropriate</item></list></p>                                          <p>If funding were available for this position, additional activities and                     responsibilities could include:                                          <list><item>providing basic consultation via email, answering questions that fall                     below the threshold for consultancy but above what respondents on e.g.                     the TEI list are likely to provide.</item>                     <item>ensuring that customizations and other TEI-related tools, stylesheets,                     etc. arising out of TEI consultations are made available to the TEI                     community in a usable form.</item>                     <item>cultivating relationships with relevant disciplinary bodies to                     coordinate the development of appropriate customizations</item>                     <item>maintaining active contact with consultants (especially those                     providing support under the TEI consultancy grants program) and                     identifying projects whose outcomes include products (e.g.                     customizations, conversion stylesheets, tools, etc.) might be of benefit                     to the TEI community at large</item>                     <item>at the conclusion of a project, receiving these products and doing                     whatever is necessary to polish, document and publish them on the TEI                     site (e.g. providing explanatory material, checking for bugs, adding                     comments, etc.)</item>                     <item>curating this library of customizations (e.g. migrating them forward                     to future versions of the TEI as necessary)</item></list></p>             </div>         </body>     </text> </TEI> ",
