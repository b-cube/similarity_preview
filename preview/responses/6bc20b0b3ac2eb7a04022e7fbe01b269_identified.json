The weight in milligrams (mg) is given of each surviving bee recorded as it was removed from the outside of the nest as we progressed towards the nest core. Bumblebee colonies of similar mass were provided with sugar syrup (UT, n=12), containing chlorpyrifos (CP, 150  nanomolar nM, n=6) imidacloprid (IMD, 10 nM, n= 6) or both (IMD + CP, n=12). No pollen was provided and bees were free to forage in a wilderness/grassland area in the west of Scotland.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from up to 591 1km squares and scaling up to a national level. The data are summarized as percentage increase or decrease in habitat area per Land Class (areas of similar environmental characteristics) and are in a vector format. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB and using the 'ITE Land Classification' as a method of stratification. The data were collected as part of Countryside Survey, a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978 by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares.

In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-04T14:09:44Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5e7b868b-890f-4246-b818-026ff19e60e2\">     <title>Conservation biological control experiments data, 2005-2009 - RELU Re-bugging the system: promoting adoption of alternative pest management strategies in field crop </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5e7b868b-890f-4246-b818-026ff19e60e2</link>     <description>This set of conservation biological control experiments data was collected as part of five field experiments investigating agricultural biological control techniques, particularly the effect of wild field margins on pests and predators.  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.   Despite the widespread concerns regarding the use of pesticides in food production and the availability of potentially viable biological pest control strategies in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems, the UK cereal crop production remains a bastion of pesticide use. This project aimed to understand further the reasons for this lack of adoption, using the control of summer cereal aphids as a case study.  Reasons for this lack of adoption of biocontrol remain a complex interplay of both technical and economic problems. Economists highlight the potential path dependency of an industry to continue to employ a suboptimal technology, caused by past dynamics of adoption resulting in differential private cost structures of each technique. Further, risk aversion on the part of farmers regarding the perceived efficacy of a new technology may also limit up-take. This may be particularly important when IPM rests on portfolios of technologies and when little scientific understanding exists on the effect of portfolio and scale of adoption on overall efficacy. Faced with this, farmers will not adopt a socially superior IPM technology and there exists a clear need for public policy action. This action may take the form of minimising uncertainty through carefully designed research programs, government funding and dissemination of the results of large-scale research studies or direct public support for farm landscape and farm system changes that can promote biocontrol.  This research looked at alternatives to the use of insecticides in arable agriculture and the difficulties facing producers in switching over to them. Two approaches were explored: habitat manipulations, to encourage predators and parasites, and using naturally occurring odours to manipulate predator distribution as model technologies. Scale and portfolio effects on biocontrol efficacy have been investigated in controlled and field scale experiments. Aim is to improve the way research and development of new products and techniques are carried out to help break the dependence on chemical pesticides.  'Semiochemical experiment data, 2005-2009 - RELU Re-bugging the system: promoting adoption of alternative pest management strategies in field crop systems' data from this same research project are also available through the CEH Information Gateway.  In addition, socio-economic research has been used to help direct natural science research into the development and evaluation of a combination of habitat management and semiochemical push-pull strategies of appropriate scale and complementarity to yield viable, commercially attractive and sustainable alternatives to the use of insecticides in cereal crop agriculture. These socio-economic data are available through the UK Data Archive under study number 6960 (see online resources).

The Climoor field site is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increase temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots(July to September annually). We have measured a range of key community characteristics and processes (ranging from plant diversity to rates of soil respiration) since the experiment began in 1998. In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain). Detailed descriptions of the site (including both vegetation and soil) and treatments are included in the supporting information as well as the methods used, and it is vital that this is considered when re-using this data. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Coordinate reference systems</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Elevation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Climate change</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heathland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>drought</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>warming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calluna</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vaccinium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Empetrum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>automated roof technology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>shrubland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Clocaenog Forest</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ruthin</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NE Wales.</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>atmosphere-vegetation-soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biweekly to annual</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03637 Task 11</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03012NEU Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02613 Task 1</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C03425 Task 9</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C02639 Task 2</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01735NEW</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-26T14:42:39Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1577ff82-f44e-458b-b576-6686ceaa1297\">     <title>UK ecological status map view service (WMS)</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1577ff82-f44e-458b-b576-6686ceaa1297</link>     <description>This is a web map service (WMS) for the UK ecological status map - a spatial indicator of ecological status for valuation of biodiversity across the UK, based on species occurrence records</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-05-14T09:21:35Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/de35d4ea-e75e-464c-b82f-2c2c1402cf8e\">     <title>Location and identification of soil sample sites from the Wolf and Tamar catchment </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/de35d4ea-e75e-464c-b82f-2c2c1402cf8e</link>     <description>This dataset contains the codes for water laboratory analysis, sampling dates and locations for soil samples collected from the Tamar catchment in winter 2013/2014 as part of the South West project.
