The study known as the CREEK Project began in January 1996. Based on detailed geomorphological observations from North Inlet creeks, by fall of 1996, eight small intertidal creeks had been selected based on similarities in size and configuration.  Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured weekly in each creek and exhibited seasonal and inter-annual influences.  Triplicate 1000-ml (one Liter) water samples were collected weekly from March 1997 to February 2000 at a depth of 1.0 meter below the water's surface three hours after high tide from each of the eight experimental creeks. Water temperature was recorded at the time of collection; time was recorded in DST. The water samples were analyzed for chlorophyll a, nitrogen [total nitrogen filtered (TNF), ammonia (NH4), and nitrate (NO3)], phosphorus [total phosphorus filtered (TPF), and orthophosphate (PO4)], organic carbon [dissolved (DOC)], and suspended sediment [Total Suspended Sediment (SusSol), Organic Suspended Sediment (OSS), Inorganic Suspended Sediment (ISS)]. Salinity was measured when the samples were brought into the laboratory for processing.</abstract> <purpose>The CREEK Project water chemistry program was initiated in March 1997 to monitor nutrient cycling in the eight experimental creeks. A larger purpose of this monitoring program was to combine the water chemistry, chlorophyll a, and suspended sediment monitoring data with other aspects of the CREEK Project (i.e. nekton, oyster and phytoplankton) ecological monitoring data to provide ecosystem level information and understanding about the role of oyster reefs.</purpose> <supplinf> In the original raw weekly Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; the Organic Solids and Ashfree Dry Weight (AFDW) were labeled together in the same column within the Suspended Solids worksheet.  This was incorrect because AFDW by definition represents inorganic suspended solids (ISS), not organic suspended solids (OSS).  However, the formula within the column calculated the organic suspended solids (OSS). Therefore, AshfreeSS actually represented the OSS values within all of the raw worksheets.  In February of 2004 the Rescue Data Manager corrected the problem by renaming the column as OSS and by calculating and creating an ISS variable and file. The term, ISS, was used to replace the term, AshfreeSS, which is used in the original raw spreadsheets.  No changes were made to the original raw files, but copies and changes were made to these files. These new corrected files were placed in the DATA directory in the \"RESCUE2003.PROCESS\" directory and were also carried forward into the RESCUE2003.FINAL directory.  See the section called \"Resource Description\" for Directory and Files listings. Several other datasets were collected over varying periods during the four years.  Oyster biomass data was collected to determine the natural average biomass of oysters within intertidal creeks so that all creeks could be adjusted to that average level and subsequently to monitor changes in oyster biomass since elucidating the role of oysters was the primary purpose of the overall study.  Intensive planktonic - microbial loop sampling and experiments were conducted in selected creeks at various times.  Collections of all nekton in creeks during bankfull neap tides were conducted seasonally during three years of the project, one pre-manipulation year and two post-manipulation years. Oyster growth was measured monthly during the same period of nekton collections.  Infection intensities of the oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, were made in fall of the pre-manipulation year and once following the manipulation.  See the Creek Project Overview documentation for information on publications, presentations, and other undergraduate and graduate research project topics. Summary of important results: Although covering 25-70% (avg.40%) of intertidal creek bottoms, oysters do not dominate faunal biomass or the remineralization of nutrients. Totally unexpected was the finding that summer nekton (fishes, shrimps, crabs) biomass is higher than oyster biomass. Nekton prefer certain creeks to others and these distributions are related to creek shape, mean depth, flooding and discharge rate, and distance to upland ridge, but not creek size (volume, area, or length). A tag/recapture study by a student found that pinfish migrated into flooding creeks but did not move among creeks. El Ni&amp;ntilde;o, a global environmental event, was clearly evident from the analysis of three years of weekly chlorophyll and nutrient data (1997-2000). Utilizing limited literature values and preliminary experiments, a simple budget for ammonium indicated that nekton inputs were considerably greater than oyster excretion as a source to intertidal creeks.

Standard curves were analyzed in order to insure linearity and instrument stability. For TN and TP five blanks were prepared and analyzed to determine the level of contamination of the oxidizing reagent used in each batch of total nitrogen and total phosphorus samples.  These blanks were run in duplicate and the lowest value was used as a correction for that batch of total samples. Samples, which were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on the SHIMADZU TOC-500 Carbon Analyzer, were run in triplicate and means were reported. Chlorophyll a values were determined by standard method of Fluorometric Analysis.  The fluorometer was calibrated by running standard curves, which were then used to generate correction equations. All recorded sediment weights were determined using a four-place Analytical Balance with a standard deviation of (+/-) 0.1 mg. </attraccr> <qattracc> <attraccv> &gt;Total Nitrogen Filtered (TNF)  &amp;plusmn; 1 micromoles per liter* &gt;Total Phosphorus Filtered (TPF)  &amp;plusmn; 1 micromoles per liter* &gt;Ortho phosphate (PO4)   &amp;plusmn; 0.08 micromoles per liter* &gt;Ammonia (NH4)    &amp;plusmn; 0.2 micromoles per liter* &gt;Nitrate (NO3)    &amp;plusmn; 0.1 micromoles per liter* &gt;Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)  &amp;plusmn; 0.1 milligrams per liter &gt;Total Suspended Solids (SusSol)  &amp;plusmn; 0.001 grams per liter (&amp;plusmn; 1 milligram/liter) &gt;Organic Suspended Solids (OSS)  &amp;plusmn; 0.001 grams per liter (&amp;plusmn; 1 milligram per/liter) &gt;Inorganic Suspended Solids (ISS)  &amp;plusmn; 0.001 grams per liter (&amp;plusmn; 1 milligram/liter) &gt;Chlorophyll a (Chla)   &amp;plusmn; 0.1 micrograms per liter (&amp;micro;g/l) &gt;Salinity     &amp;plusmn; 2 parts per thousand &gt;Water Temperature    &amp;plusmn; 1 degrees Celsius &gt; [*micromoles per liter (&amp;micro;M/L) = microgram atoms per liter (&amp;micro;g atoms/L) &gt;Parameter Number of Decimal Places &gt;TNF  1 &gt;TPF  1 &gt;PO4  2 &gt;NH4  2 &gt;NO3  2 &gt;DOC  1 &gt;SusSol  3 &gt;OSS  3 &gt;ISS  3 &gt;CHLA  2 &gt;SAL  0 &gt;TEMP  0 </attraccv> <attracce> TNF and TPF:  The Technicon Autoanalyzer used for these analyses reports values to three decimal places, but due to variations and slight contamination of the oxidizing reagent, handling, and processing of the water samples, the accuracy of the final values is only to &amp;plusmn; 1 micromoles per liter.  However, the measurements (reported in micromoles per liter) are reported with one decimal place.  Negative calculated values for total nitrogen and phosphorus can occur and negative values are the result of mathematical manipulation of the raw values. PO4, NH4, and NO3:  The handling and processing of these nutrients is more accurate, and there is less room for error. The measurements (reported in micromoles per liter) are given with two decimal places. DOC:  A Shimadzu Carbon analyzer was used that reads to the nearest one hundredth, but because the final value is an average of the three values, the nearest tenth of a milligram per liter is used (one decimal place). SusSol, OSS, and ISS:  The balance reads to the fourth decimal place of a gram (ten thousands of a gram), but humidity in the air can influence the filters, so the 3rd decimal place is read and assumed accurate (&amp;plusmn;0.001 g = &amp;plusmn; 1 milligram). Measurements are reported in grams/liter with three decimal places in the database. Chlorophyll a:  Strickland and Parsons (1972) say that detection limits depend upon the volume filtered and the sensitivity of the fluorometer.  Using a Turner fluorometer, the accuracy limit documentation states a limit of 0.01 &amp;micro;g/L when 2 L was filtered.  Because we filter 10-20 ml, the accuracy would be much less. We are estimating that our chlorophyll accuracy is 0.1 &amp;micro;g/L at best.  No tests have been done to verify this.  Measurements are reported in micrograms/liter with two decimal places in the database. Strickland, J.D.H., and T.R. Parsons. 1972. A Practical Handbook of Seawater Analysis, Seconded.

These negative values are not generated by the Technicon Autoanalyzer.  Negative values are the result of mathematical manipulation of the raw values.  Very low values approaching the lower detection limit should be suspect and considered zero values.  The actual negative values should be viewed as an indicator of the range of error involved in the method for analysis. These values are reported as negative values in the final data set, they are not changed to zero. Negative values can occur for one or a combination of the following reasons: &gt;    1) The nutrient concentration of the sample approaches the minimum detection &gt;            limit of the technique - the assumption is that the baseline drift on the &gt;            technicon is both linear &amp; incremental &gt;    2) Errors were incurred during the preparation of the samples for analysis &gt;    3) Subtraction of the oxidation reagent blank from the very low total nutrient &gt;            concentration &gt; Negative values for Orthophosphate (PO4) and Nitrate (NO3) also indicate that the concentration of the sample is below the minimum detection limit of the technique, these values should be viewed as an indicator of the range of error involved in the method of analysis and are reported as negative, they are not changed to zero. Negative values for Total Suspended Solids (SusSol), Organic Suspended Solids (OSS), and Inorganic Suspended Solids (ISS) are rare, but can exist due to the measuring error of the electronic balance plus the minute amount of solids on the filter. </logic> <complete> Missing Data: The MS Excel data file is verified for typographical errors by the Data Manager.  Missing data values are represented by periods.  Missing values are usually a result of aborted samplings (i.e. boat or weather problems); other missing values are due to samples being lost or contaminated. The first sampling was named CP1 (Creek Project #1) and the numbers were sequential up to the last sample date.  If a sample week was missed, a sample number was not skipped.  Triplicate samples were taken at each creek. Creek 1a, Creek 1b, and Creek 1c represent the first, second, and third samples taken at Creek 1, respectively.

CP 59 on 5/8/1998, creek 2a (24.62), creek 2b (24.71), and creek 2c (27.14), the values were very high which might be due to a strong thunderstorm the night before.  CP 64 on 6/9/1998, creek 4a (59.85) and creek 4c (37.17), the values were high because it was very turbid from boat disturbance which is noted by the water chemistry technician. CP 64 on 6/9/1998, creek 4a (59.85) was not listed in the raw excel spreadsheet; however, the value was listed in the raw data sheets. The Rescue Data Manager entered this value into the process data sheets.

OSS In the original raw weekly Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; the Organic Solids and Ashfree Dry Weight (AFDW) were labeled together in the same column within the Suspended Solids worksheet.  This was incorrect because AFDW by definition represents inorganic suspended solids (ISS), not organic suspended solids (OSS).  However, the formula within the column calculated the organic suspended solids (OSS). Therefore, AshfreeSS actually represented the OSS values within all of the raw worksheets.  In February of 2004 the Rescue Data Manager corrected the problem by renaming the column as OSS and by calculating and creating an ISS file. The term, ISS, was used to replace the term, AshfreeSS, which is used in the original raw spreadsheets.  No changes were made to the original raw files, but copies and changes were made to these files. These new corrected files were placed in the DATA directory in the \"RESCUE2003.PROCESS\" directory and carried forward into the RESCUE2003.FINAL directory.  See the section called \"Resource Description\" for Directory and Files listings.

CP 70 on 7/21/1998, CP 76 on 9/4/1998 and CP 119 on 6/29/1999, the values were high due to a very low tide which was noted by the water chemistry technician. CP 20 on 7/29/1997, creek 4a (0.075), creek 4b (0.066), and creek 4c (0.072), the values were high which may due to a low mid - ebb tide.

CP 143 on 12/20/1999, creek 4c and CP 149 on 2/9/2000, creek 8b, missing numbers were inserted into the values in the oxidized weight column by the Rescue Data Manager.  The value in the oxidized weight column for CP 143 was listed as 0.126; however the correct number is 0.1206. The value in the oxidized weight column for CP149 was 0.118; however the correct number is 0.1128. CP 102 on 3/2/1999, creek 1a (-0.001) and CP 120 on 7/9/1999, creek 1b (-0.010) had negative values.  In checking for errors in calculation, the Rescue Data Manager determined that the recorded oxidized weight for the two samples with negative values were actually higher than the total weights. This is due to the measuring error of the electronic balance plus the minute amount of solids on the filter.

Temperature was also taken at the same time.  The water samples were placed in a cooler (no ice) which kept it ambient temperature, and the samples were filtered back in the lab usually within an hour of collection; however, if the samples could not be brought back within the hour, they were placed in an ice chest.  {Tests were run to determine if filtering the water after one hour gave different nutrient concentration values from the samples which were filtered within one hour. There were no significant differences observed.} Date, sample name, water temperature, time and samplers were recorded in the field on a master data sheet and kept with all values obtained for that sample number. </methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Field Collection Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Water Temperature Water temperature was measured in the field with a mercury filled thermometer from the water sample taken at the 1.0 meter level below the surface water.

Water from the sample was placed onto a hand-held refractometer.  Seventy-five to 500 ml of the water samples were filtered through a pre-weighed pre-combusted Whatman GFF 0.7 &amp;micro;m (nominal pore size) glass fiber filter usually within one hour of the water sample collection at the Baruch Marine Field Laboratory's Water Chemistry Lab to separate the particulates from the water.  Samples were shaken up first before filtering began; the amount of water filtered was determined by how much sediment and other solids were in the sample.  In the winter in the absence of phytoplankton blooms and when sedimentation was low, up to 400 ml were filtered. In the summer and usually after heavy rains, less water was filtered; the determining factor was to get a good sample of suspended solids on the filter from the water sample in order to get beyond the minimum detection limits of the SusSol analysis. A 0.7 &amp;micro;m (nominal pore size) glass fiber filter was used throughout the entire study to determine the cutoff between dissolved and particulate constitutes in the water sample.  The filtered water is then run through a Technicon Analyzer. The following water chemistry analysis used filtered aliquots (&lt; 0.7 &amp;micro;m):  NH4, NO3, PO4, TN, TP, and carbon (DOC).  What remained on the 0.7 &amp;micro;m filters were used for the Suspended solid and Chlorophyll a analysis. Technicons have a datalogger that calculates the concentrations and puts them into a temporary file as the trays are run. The data are transferred via software to a computer that stores the concentrations in a file. No correction is necessary for the ortho phosphate (PO4), Nitrate-Nitrite (NO3), or Ammonia (NH4).  The only data corrections required are for Whole and Filtered Total Nitrogen and Whole and Filtered Total Phosphorus. The correction formula is established in the spreadsheet that will take each concentration number, subtract out the Oxidizer Reagent Blank (ORB) and then multiply the number by the Dilution factor.  These two numbers are supplied by the chemist. </methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Laboratory Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Orthophosphate (PO4) The filtrate (&lt;0.7 &amp;micro;m) was used in the procedure to determine the PO4 chemistry.

The filtrate (&lt;0.7 &amp;micro;m) was used in the procedure to determine the TNF and TPF chemistries.  The TN &amp; TP method is a combination of two methods listed below, but in general the procedure consisted of an alkaline persulfate oxidation followed by automated analysis for nitrogen (as nitrate) and phosphorus (as phosphate) on a Technicon Auto Analyzer for all four chemistries.  Oxidation reagent blanks (ORB) are run with each batch of persulfate digestion reagents. With alkaline persulfate digestion, all nitrogen in the sample was oxidized to nitrate, which was then reduced by cadmium and analyzed as nitrite.  The precision and recovery of this method compared favorably with a Kjeldahl procedure (D'Elia et al., 1977).  The main advantage of the persulfate oxidation was the speed and convenience with which it was accomplished.  Unlike the Kjeldahl method, which recovered only organic and NH4 - nitrogen, the persulfate oxidation also included NO3 and NO2 nitrogen. This semi-automated procedure combines the persulfate oxidation with automated nitrate and phosphate analysis to provide simultaneous analysis for total persulfate nitrogen (TPN) and total persulfate phosphorus (TTP) (Glibert et al., 1977).  Glibert's procedure has been further modified to use smaller sample size so that the digestion flask can double as the sampler tray cup (Loder 1978).  With this method, many samples can be run quickly with a minimum of handling. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>C.F. D'Elia</origin> <origin>P.A. Steudler</origin> <origin>N.

Weekly water chemistries were analyzed in the water chemistry laboratory, and the data values from each analysis were later entered (either by hand or by ftp) into a Microsoft Excel workbook file, verified, edited and finalized. Sampling event numbers were assigned to each weekly sampling CP # (C=CREEK, P= Project).  The first sampling was named CP1 and the numbers were sequential up to the last sample date.  If a sample week was missed, a sample number was not skipped.  Therefore, each weekly file is named as follows: CP01-CP99; beginning 2/16/1999 the naming convention was changed to CPA100-CPA151. The database is compiled and maintained in yearly MS Excel Workbooks.  All hardcopy (paper) data collected were kept in individual weekly files and organized by sample number.  Hardcopies of all raw datasheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's data archival room. Worksheets also known as \"tabs\" within each Excel Workbook file are where each water chemistry calculations were made. These tabs represent \"Process\" spreadsheets for particular groups of parameters, such as sediment, nutrient, or chlorophyll.  Any calculations or manipulation of the data necessary to achieve the final data take place within these \"Process\" work sheets.  In this way, the critical process/calculation steps can be kept with the final data.  The process steps taken to reach the final database values are explained below. In the original MS Excel spreadsheets, the data was compiled into yearly spreadsheets for 1997, 1998, and 1999. NOTE: some data from 1998 occurs in the 1997 file, 1997 includes data from March 19, 1997-February 11, 1998, 1998 includes data from February 17, 1998-February 22,1999, and 1999 includes data from March 2, 1999-February 23, 2000. Each spreadsheet contained all of the water chemistry research conducted throughout the year which was listed in separate tabs within the spreadsheets. The data were also plotted and examined for potential outliers and errors in the data. The original annual files also contain logged data and graphics for each water chemistry variable. All water chemistry parameters were logarithmically transformed to ensure equal variability, but temperature and salinity observations were not transformed.  The Grubbs test (Grubbs and Beck, 1972*) was used to determine outliers; only two observations were deleted.  *Grubbs, F.E. and G. Beck.  1972.  Extension of sample sizes and percentage points for significance tests of outlying observations.  Technometrics  14:847-854. Parameter Sheets: Salinity and Volume Filtered Process When the water sample reaches the chemistry laboratory, salinity readings are taken with a refractometer and recorded for each water sample on a parameter sheet.  The parameter sheets are handwritten data sheets that include:  date, cruise #, sample #, site, time, weather, salinity, temperature, suspended solids and chlorophyll a sample volume filtered, and any pertinent comments.  A data technician entered these data into yearly \"Process\" Excel worksheet or tab. TNF, TPF, NO3, NH4, PO4 Process Information on the samples in each tray of nutrients run through the technicon is recorded on a \"Run Sheet\" by the water chemistry technician.  The technicons have a datalogger that calculates the concentrations, puts them into a temporary text file, and produces an output printout with the same information.  Hardcopies of both the printouts and run sheets are maintained on site in the BMFL's data archival room. No corrections are necessary for the orthophosphate (PO4), nitrate (NO3), or Ammonia (NH4) concentrations from the Technicon printout.  A data technician entered these data into yearly MS Excel nutrient process worksheets, and later copied the values directly into the final yearly Excel file. Total Nitrogen Filtered and Total Phosphorus Filtered data from the technicon printout do require corrections.  A data technician entered these data into yearly TNTP MS Excel files.  Within this file, a calculation was performed which took each concentration number, subtracted the Oxidizer Reagent Blank (ORB), and then multiplied the number by the Dilution factor.  The ORB values and dilution factors were supplied by the chemist. Once the totals were calculated in the process worksheet tab, they were copied into the final yearly spreadsheet tab. Technicon printouts for TNF, TPF 10/22/99 (CP 134), NH4 9/23/99 (CP 130), and NO3OP 12/20/99 (CP 143) all changed formats for the rest of the project. The chemistry process is still the same, however a new computer program was implemented and this is why the printouts look different. Total Nitrogen Filtered and Total Phosphorus Filtered data from the technicon printout do require corrections. The correction formula was established in the \"TNTP\" \"Process\" tab of the Workbook. It takes each concentration number, subtracts the Oxidizer Reagent Blank (ORB), and then multiplies the number by the Dilution factor.  The ORB values and dilution factors are supplied by the chemist.  Once the totals are verified error-free and the final value is calculated, the final values are copied from the TNTP \"Process\" tab into the FINAL spreadsheet tab. Process and Calculation Description for Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll readings were recorded onto new Chlorophyll data sheets that also contained the sample site, date, door factor, fluorometer gain, sample volume, dilution factor, and other parameters important to the calculation of the final chlorophyll data.    A data technician entered the values from the data sheets into the \"Process\" tab of the yearly MS Excel Workbook, where final values are calculated in micrograms per liter and copied to the FINAL tab of the Workbook. Calculated chlorophyll values (in micrograms per liter) are derived using the raw data and predetermined door factors and gain factor.  For those samples that were acidified, a Tau value is also calculated and incorporated into the formula.  Over the course of the database, there have been changes in equipment and protocol.  Therefore, with changes in filters, fluorometers, door factor values, etc., the calculation process has also evolved.  The following are explanations and formulas for individual time periods of chlorophyll data. &gt;Where, &gt; FD = Door Factor (as calculated for each door) &gt; FO = Chla reading &gt; FA = Phae reading &gt; Gain = Gain value &gt; Volume filtered = 10 or 20ml, normally 10ml as of 1 May and 20ml on 1 December &gt; Volume Extract = 10ml, from Greenberg et al. (1980) &gt; Tau(T) = acid factor (as calculated) March 19, 1997 - December 17, 1998; Creek Projects 1-91: Data processing for chlorophyll since July 23 has been completed using the Sequoia-Turner Model 450 Fluorometer, SC 665 nanometer emission filter, and NB 440 nanometer excitation filter.  This filter does not allow for the measurement of the FA wavelength and is specific to chlorophyll a (FO) only.  Neither Tau nor FA values are used in the final calculation.  The \"span\" knob for this period was turned to minimum, and as a result, it was no longer necessary to use the correction factor (6.4) for maximum span in the denominator. &gt;Chl (ug/L) =((FD)(FO)(50)(vol. extract)) / ((vol. filtered)(Gain)) &gt; FD values &gt; 1x=5.38 &gt; 3x=0.379 &gt; 10x=0.09 &gt; 30x=0.053 &gt; December 21, 1998 - February 23, 2000; Creek Projects 92-151: Data processing for this period was the same as above, with the exception of the new door factors listed below. &gt; 1x=8.76 &gt; 3x=0.46 &gt; 10x=0.107 &gt; 30x=0.077 &gt; The door factors are not the same on the handwritten data sheets and the \"process\" excel spreadsheets. The door factors used to calculate the chlorophyll a values were from the \"process\" excel spreadsheets and not from the raw data sheets. Process and Calculation Description for Suspended Solids (SusSol, OSS, and ISS) Filter number, weights of pre-weighed filters, dried sample weights for SusSol, and muffled sample weights for OSS were hand written onto datasheets.  A data technician entered the values from the parameter sheets into the \"Process\" tab of the yearly MS Excel workbook, where final values are then copied to the FINAL tab of the workbook.  Final values were calculated using the following formulas. Suspended Solids Calculations: &gt;SusSol value (g) = [Total wt.(g) minus (-) Filter weight(g)]. &gt;Organic Sediment value (g) = [Total wt.(g) minus (-) Oxidized wt.(g)] &gt;Inorganic Sediment value (g) = [Total sediment value(g) minus (-) Organic sediment value(g)] &gt; TO CONVERT TO MILLIGRAMS PER LITER: &gt;Total Suspended Solids (SusSol) (g/L) = [[Total Sediment value (g) times (x) 1000] divided by (/) volume of water sample filtered (ml)] &gt;Organic Suspended Solids (OSS) (g/L) = [[Organic Sediment value (g) times (x) 1000] divided by (/) volume of water sample filtered (ml)] &gt;Inorganic Suspended Solids (ISS) (g/L) = [[Inorganic Sediment value (g) times (x) 1000] divided by (/) volume of water sample filtered (ml)] &gt; Process and Calculation Description for Carbon: Information on the samples in each tray run through the Shimadzu Carbon Analyzer is recorded on a \"Run Sheet\" by the Water Chemistry Technician.  The carbon analyzer produces an output printout with three DOC concentrations (in mg/L) and an average of the three concentrations for each sample.  A data technician entered the average value into the \"Process\" nutrient MS Excel spreadsheet.  These values were later copied directly into the final yearly tab. &gt;               Data Rescue Process Description Data Capture of Original Raw and Final Data Files and Documentation (July 2003) Obtained original Raw hardcopy data sheets from PI, David Bushek.  Raw digital values in the MS Excel process worksheet tabs and the Final yearly digital data files also came from David Bushek.  Project manager, Leah Gregory created the first version of this metadata record. Data Verification, Editing, and Graphing (August 2003) The database was verified using hardcopy original datasheets and MS Excel spreadsheets to account for missing and anomalous data. The Data Rescue Data Manager edited the Final data by comparing the hardcopy original datasheets to the original MS Excel Final spreadsheet tabs.  In the original MS Excel spreadsheets, the data was compiled into yearly spreadsheets for 1997, 1998, and 1999.  Each spreadsheet contained all of the water chemistry research conducted throughout the year which was listed in separate tabs within the spreadsheets.  The original database that was obtained from the PIs was modified when creating the Final Rescued database. The spreadsheet data was transposed (i.e. the data was rearranged by creek and date). When rearranging yearly spreadsheets for 1997, 1998, and 1999 in MS Excel, some of the columns were not complete (i.e. the formulas were not copied into the corresponding cells).  So the formulas were copied into the empty cells.  This only applies to the log spreadsheets. Creation of Final Rescued Databases (September through December 2003) Further modification of the original database included the removal of the log transformed data. Also, the creek's entire sample A's were arranged together chronologically, then creek B and creek C.  Separate spreadsheets (tabs) and folders were created for each creek and water chemistry analyzed. Each tab was then sorted by creek and then by date.  Further, water chemistry values were corrected for the right amount of decimal places. Final metadata was created by verifying, editing, and updating the documentation. The entire database including date, creek, and triplicate for all 3 years is contained in the Final Rescued database called, WATERCHEMISTRY.RESCUE2003.FINAL. It is arranged by creek and date. The data was then imported into Sigma Plot software, graphed, and reviewed for anomalous data. Final graphics were created after the review and edit process. Data Archive and Dissemination of Rescued Data, Documentation, and Graphics (February 2004) All original raw datasheets were scanned into digital format and archived on the 1996-2000 CREEK Project Archive CD in the WATERCHEMISTRY.ORIGINAL.RAW Directory.  All original digital Excel workbook files obtained from the PIs that contain data in the worksheet process data and final worksheet data was also burned to CD and are archived in the WATERCHEMISTRY.ORIGINAL.RAW/DATA directory.  The individual worksheet water chemistry tabs and worksheet final data were also exported as text (CSV) format and placed in the \"RAW\" directory. The \"PROCESS\" directory contains the Final data values that were rearranged by Creek/Date. Each Creek's data is in a separate spreadsheet.  The \"PROCESS\" directory also contains the final yearly data with its water chemistry tabs and the Sigma Plot files.  Inorganic Suspended Solids (ISS) file and tabs were archived in the \"PROCESS\" and \"FINAL\" directories. Please see Supplemental Information for further explanation.  The final merged FINAL.CREEKWATERCHEM database, its graphics (exported as jpg format), and final metadata are located in the WATERCHEMISTRY.RESCUE2003.FINAL directory of the 1996-2000 CREEK Project Archive CD. Rescued final data, graphics, and metadata are also all printed out into a hardcopy paper version.  The hardcopy and CD versions are compiled into a 3-ring binder notebook and stored at the BMFL Computer Laboratory.  All original printed documentation is also in the 3-ring notebook.  The 1996-2000 CREEK Project Archive CD is kept in a fireproof cabinet at the BMFL data manager's office.  Final data, graphics, and metadata are also available on Baruch Institute's web site: http://links.baruch.sc.edu/data/ and archived on Baruch's Rescue Server.

TN, TP: T = Total (i.e. after alkaline persulfate oxidation / digestion); TNF= Total Nitrogen Filtered, TPF = Total Phosphorus Filtered PO4 = Ortho phosphate levels measured from a filtered aliquot (as described above). PO4log = Log of ortho phosphate values. NH4 = Ammonia levels measured from a filtered aliquot (as described above). NH4log = Log of ammonia values. NO3 = Nitrate levels measured from a filtered aliquot (as described above). NO3log = Log of nitrate values. DOC = Dissolved organic carbon levels measured from a filtered aliquot (as described above) SusSol = Total suspended solids; anything such as zooplankton, algae, sand, etc. that stays on the 0.7 micrometer GFF Whatman filter after filtering the water sample. SusSol = total dried sample weight minus the filter weight divided by the volume of water sample filtered. SusSolLog = Log of total suspended solids. AshfreeSS (OSS) = Note: These values actually represent Organic suspended solids(OSS); total dried sample weight - oxidized weight (weight of filter and the inorganic material which would not volatilize at 450 degrees C) divided by the volume of water sample filtered.  This variable name has been changed to OSS. Ashfreelog = Note: These values actually represent the log of Organic Suspended Solids (OSS). ISS = Inorganic suspended sediments (solids); the oxidized weight minus the initial precombusted filter weight divided by the volume of water sample filtered. This variable is not found in the original raw database. CHLA = Chlorophyll a levels measured fluorometrically. CHLAlog =  Log of Chlorophyll a values. SAL = Salinity measured in parts per thousand from a refractometer. TEMP = Temperature measured in degrees Celsius. &gt;    Type (total size of &gt;Variable    value.number of decimal places)  *Range of Measurement (min-max)* &gt;Creek    Integer, Alpha  1-8, A-C &gt;Date (mm/dd/yyyy)   Integer   1-12, 1-31, 1997-2000 &gt;Sample#    Integer   1-151 &gt;Total Nitrogen Filtered (TNF) Real 4.1   0.2 - 77.3 &gt;Total Phosphorus Filtered (TPF) Real 4.1   -0.6 - 4.8 &gt;Ortho phosphate (PO4)  Real 5.2   -0.04 - 2.23 &gt;Ammonia (NH4)   Real 5.2   0.08 - 41.50 &gt;Nitrate (NO3)   Real 5.2   -0.01 - 4.70 &gt;Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) Real 4.1   1.2 - 25.7 &gt;Total Suspended Solids (SusSol) Real 5.3   0.012 - 0.815 &gt;Organic Suspended Solids (OSS) Real 6.3   -0.010 - 0.153 &gt;Inorganic Suspended Solids (ISS) Real 5.3   0.001 - 0.663 &gt;Chlorophyll a (CHLA)  Real 5.2   0.32 - 62.91 &gt;Salinity (SAL)   Integer    6 - 37 &gt;Temperature (TEMP)   Integer   3 - 35 &gt; &gt;*Range of measurement values are actual highest and lowest values collected during the &gt; database timeframe.
