This data collection contains information on employment status, occupation, and industry field for respondents aged 15 years and over. In addition to providing these core data, the October survey also contains a special supplement on school enrollment for households that contained children aged 3 years or older. The supplement collected the following information: current grade at public or private school, college enrollment, year when a regular school was last attended, and year of high school graduation. Demographic variables such as age, sex, race, marital status, veteran status, household relationship, educational background, and Hispanic origin are included.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1996-10\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-10</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1996-10-13\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-10-13</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1996-10-19\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-10-19</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                   <geogUnit>county</geogUnit>                   <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>             <anlyUnit>household</anlyUnit>                     <universe>All persons in the civilian non-institutional population of the United States living in households.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The probability sample including approximately 57,000 households.          </sampProc>                                             <collMode>mail questionnaire</collMode>                        <weight>               The CPS estimation procedure involves weighting the data from each sample person. The base weight, which is the inverse of the probability of the person being in the sample, is a rough measure of the number of actual persons that the sample person represent. Almost all sample persons in the same state have the same base weight, but the weights across states are different. Selection probabilities may also differ for some sample areas due to field subsampling, which is done when areas selected for the sample contain many more households than expected. The base weights are then adjusted for non-interview, and the ratio estimation procedure is applied. The following weight variables are provided in the dataset: HWHHWGT (Household weight, used for tallying household characteristics); PWFMWGT (Family weight, only used for tallying family characteristics); PWLGWGT (Longitudinal weight, only found in adult records matched from month to month, and used for gross flows analysis); PWORWGT (Outgoing rotation weight, used for tallying information collected only in outgoing rotations; PWSSWGT (Final weight, used for most tabulations, controlled to independent estimates for states; origin, sex, and age; and age, race, and sex).     </weight>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
