Longitudinal evidence from eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey Martin, Adam; Goryakin, Yevgeniy; Suhrcke, Marc Objective. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between active travel and psychological&#13; wellbeing.&#13; Method. This study used data on 17,985 adult commuters in eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey&#13; (1991/2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2008/9). Fixed effects regression models were used to investigate how (i.) travel mode choice, (ii.)&#13; commuting time, and (iii.) switching to active travel impacted on overall psychological wellbeing and how (iv.)&#13; travel mode choice impacted on specific psychological symptoms included in the General Health Questionnaire.&#13; Results.After accounting for changes in individual-level socioeconomic characteristics and potential confounding&#13; variables relating to work, residence and health, significant associations were observed between overall psychological&#13; wellbeing (on a 36-point Likert scale) and (i.) active travel (0.185, 95% CI: 0.048 to 0.321) and public transport&#13; (0.195, 95% CI: 0.035 to 0.355) when compared to car travel, (ii.) time spent (per 10 minute change) walking&#13; (0.083, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.163) and driving (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.033, 95% CI: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.064 to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.001), and (iii.) switching&#13; from car travel to active travel (0.479, 95% CI: 0.199 to 0.758). Active travel was also associated with reductions&#13; in the odds of experiencing two specific psychological symptoms when compared to car travel.&#13; Conclusion. The positive psychological wellbeing effects identified in this study should be considered in cost\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; benefit assessments of interventions seeking to promote active travel.

M.; Woodcock, James; Scarborough, Peter The Brighton declaration arose out of a one day workshop&#13; held in Brighton in September 2013 as part of the Society&#13; for Social Medicine annual conference. The workshop&#13; convened UK based non-communicable disease modellers&#13; to discuss the challenges and opportunities for non-communicable&#13; disease modelling in the UK. The declaration&#13; describes the value and importance of non-communicable&#13; disease modelling, both for research and for informing&#13; health policy. The declaration also describes challenges&#13; and issues for non-communicable disease modelling. The&#13; declaration has been endorsed by many non-communicable&#13; disease modellers in the UK.

Research on associations between the foodscape and diet and health has largely focussed on foodscapes around the home, despite recognition that non-home environments are likely to be important in a more complete assessment of foodscape exposure. This paper characterises and describes foodscape exposure of different types, at home, at work, and along commuting routes for a sample of working adults in Cambridgeshire, UK. Methods Home and work locations, and transport habits for 2,696 adults aged 29&amp;#8211;60 were drawn from the Fenland Study, UK. Food outlet locations were obtained from local councils and classified by type - we focus on convenience stores, restaurants, supermarkets and takeaway food outlets. Density of and proximity to food outlets was characterised at home and work. Commuting routes were modelled based on the shortest street network distance between home and work, with exposure (counts of food outlets) that accounted for travel mode and frequency. We describe these three domains of food environment exposure using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results For all types of food outlet, we found very different foodscapes around homes and workplaces (with overall outlet exposure at work 125% higher), as well as a potentially substantial exposure contribution from commuting routes. On average, work and commuting environments each contributed to foodscape exposure at least equally to residential neighbourhoods, which only accounted for roughly 30% of total exposure. Furthermore, for participants with highest overall exposure to takeaway food outlets, workplaces accounted for most of the exposure. Levels of relative exposure between home, work and commuting environments were poorly correlated. Conclusions Relying solely on residential neighbourhood characterisation greatly underestimated total foodscape exposure in this sample, with levels of home exposure unrelated to levels of away from home exposure. Such mis-estimation is likely to be expressed in analyses as attenuated parameter estimates, suggesting a minimal &amp;#8216;environmental&amp;#8217; contribution to outcomes of interest. Future work should aim to assess exposure more completely through characterising environments beyond the residential neighbourhood, where behaviours related to food consumption are likely to occur.

Methods We performed a pilot systematic review to assess the availability of information on the social distribution of intervention effects, the targeting or allocation of interventions, and the baseline characteristics of participants. This comprised (i) a rapid review of systematic reviews and (ii) a review and synthesis of a sample of primary studies included in the eligible systematic reviews. Results We found 19 systematic reviews of environmental and policy interventions. Relatively few of these (26%, n=5) were prospectively designed to examine effects on inequalities, and none were able to fully synthesise evidence of distributional effects. Over 40% of primary studies reported subgroup intervention effects; 18% reported socio-demographic interaction effects. Studies most often compared effectiveness by gender, followed by age, ethnicity, and socio-economic status. For gender, effects appeared to be evenly distributed overall, although heterogeneity in gradients between studies suggested that some interventions affect males and females differently. Conclusions Our findings suggest that it is feasible to generate better evidence about how public health interventions may affect health inequalities using existing data and innovative methods of research synthesis.
