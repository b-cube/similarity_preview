These indicators and measures are derived from the California Air Resources Board (http://www.arb.ca.gov/aqmis2/aqmis2.php and http://www.arb.ca.gov/adam/index.html). These measures describe short- and long-term exposures to PM2.5, ozone, calculated for California counties and PM10 calculated for Air Basin.</abstract> <purpose> This data set contributes to the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. Through the use of the California Environmental Health Tracking Program&apos;s web portal, it is intended that interested parties can visualize trends for these measures for each California county. </purpose> <supplinf/> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20150115</caldate> <time/> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Annually></update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.5</westbc> <eastbc>-114.1</eastbc> <northbc>42.0</northbc> <southbc>32.5</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>environment</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>EPA GIS Keyword Thesaurus</themekt> <themekey>Air</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>None</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>CEHTP Science Team</cntper> <cntorg>CDPH/EHIB</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos/> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>850 Marina Bay Parkway, Bldg P, 3rd Floor&#13;&#13;</address> <city>Richmond</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>94804</postal> <country>United States Of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(510)620-3620</cntvoice> <cnttdd/> <cntfax>(510)620-3720</cntfax> <cntemail>data@cehtp.org</cntemail> <hours/> <cntinst/> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <secinfo> <secsys>None</secsys> <secclass/> <sechandl/> </secinfo> <native>SAS 9.3 </native> </idinfo> <dataqual> <logic>N/A</logic> <complete> Data are from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) (http://www.arb.ca.gov/aqmis2/aqmis2.php and http://www.arb.ca.gov/adam/index.html); There can be considerable variability in the number of high days per year so tracking trends over time needs to be done carefully.  The variability results from a) The number of high days is related to meteorological factors (e.g., temperature and mixing heights) b) There are a small number of events per year, so for statistical reasons this type of extreme value measure will bounce around more than the average. &#13;&#13;The data represent highly populated counties that have monitors. As a result, the data tend to reflect urban air quality and longer term average air quality levels. Populations in counties without monitors may also be exposed to concentrations that exceed a standard. &#13;&#13;The percent of days that exceed the CA or U.S. benchmark does not provide information regarding the severity (maximum concentrations) of potential exposures.  Even with these limitations, trends in pollution levels are a useful measure to describe public health concerns within these areas. &#13;&#13;The short-term exposure measures are based on the percentage of high days rather than the total number of high days to highlight the fact monitors follow different operating schedules.  Because the majority of monitors do not take measurements every day, the number of short term events is uncertain and, except where  levels vary uniformly throughout the year, estimating short term measures that are representative of short term exposures over a year is complex.&#13;&#13;The relationship between ambient concentrations and personal exposure is largely unknown and variable depending upon pollutant, activity patterns, and microenvironments. &#13;&#13;Variation within counties may exist but will not be captured in this measure.  For short-term exposure measures, the monitor with the highest reading on any day in a county is used.   Larger areas will have a broader range of pollution values and perhaps more monitors that may measure a high value on a given day. Thus day and person day estimates for larger areas may be biased higher than estimates for smaller areas.  The relative variation among county populations in many states may be large enough relative to the variation in the number of days greater than the standards that the population component can dominate the calculation of the number of person-days.  Thus, careful investigation of the underlying data to properly identify changes in population and air quality is needed when comparing person-days in space and time.</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>To create person-days of exposure, PM2.5 days exceeding national standards and Ozone days exceeding national and CA standards were multiplied by population values for each county (U.S. Census data 2010 and CA Dept. of Finance data projections ). For percentage of days, the number of PM2.5 days for each county exceeding the national standard were divided by 365.2.  CARB provided the PM2.5 and PM10 short-term and long-term averages.
