However, current prediction methods generally rely on statistical models that imperfectly model transcription factor binding. Generation of new prediction methods that are based on protein binding data, but do not rely on these models may improve prediction sensitivity and specificity.</p> </sec> <sec> <st> <p>Results</p> </st> <p>We propose a method for predicting transcription factor binding sites in the genome by directly mapping data generated from protein binding microarrays (PBM) to the genome and calculating a moving average of several overlapping octamers. Using this unique algorithm, we predicted binding sites for the essential pancreatic islet transcription factor <it>Nkx2.2 </it>in the mouse genome and confirmed &gt;90% of the tested sites by EMSA and ChIP. Scores generated from this method more accurately predicted relative binding affinity than PWM based methods. We have also identified an alternative core sequence recognized by the <it>Nkx2.2 </it>homeodomain. Furthermore, we have shown that this method correctly identified binding sites in the promoters of two critical pancreatic islet &#946;-cell genes, <it>NeuroD1 </it>and <it>insulin2</it>, that were not predicted by traditional methods. Finally, we show evidence that the algorithm can also be applied to predict binding sites for the nuclear receptor <it>Hnf4&#945;</it>.</p> </sec> <sec> <st> <p>Conclusions</p> </st> <p>PBM-mapping is an accurate method for predicting Nkx2.2 binding sites and may be widely applicable for the creation of genome-wide maps of transcription factor binding sites.</p> </sec> </sec> </abs> </fm><bdy> <sec> <st> <p>Background</p> </st> <p>The dynamic process of gene regulation is essential for embryonic development and cellular function. Gene regulation is primarily mediated by the combinatorial effects of transcription factors interacting with <it>cis</it>-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. Therefore, accurate identification of transcription factor binding sites within the genome is necessary to understand a wide range of cellular processes from cell differentiation to homeostasis to cancer. However, identifying these sites within the genome remains a complex biological and computational question.</p> <p>One of the challenges in predicting transcription factor binding sites is that identification of the strongest binding sequence, or consensus site, is not sufficient. Research analyzing genome wide transcription factor occupancy has shown that low affinity binding sites are also significantly occupied in both yeast and <it>Drosophila </it> <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B1\">1</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B2\">2</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Furthermore, transcription factors from the same family have been shown to bind identical high affinity sites, but distinct low affinity sites <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B3\">3</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Therefore, identification of both high and low affinity sites will be essential to fully understand transcription factor specificity within the genome.</p> <p>Current transcription factor motif algorithms generally rely on a statistical model, such as a position weight matrix (PWM), generated with information derived from homology between co-regulated promoters, conserved regions in orthologous genes, known binding sites, or <it>in vitro </it>binding assays <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B5\">5</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, these methods have a low level of specificity and sensitivity <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B6\">6</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B7\">7</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B8\">8</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B9\">9</abbr> </abbrgrp>. This problem is due to both experimental and theoretical errors. Experimental errors include alignment of a limited set of binding sites <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B10\">10</abbr> </abbrgrp>, resulting in a PWM that is information poor, and non-physiological conditions used in <it>in vitro </it>binding assays <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B11\">11</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Theoretical errors stem from assumptions used as the basis of the PWM model. PWMs assume that contributions by individual bases within a binding site are independent and additive, and that the binding energy contribution is proportional to their frequency in the position weight matrix. However, all three of these assumptions have been called into question. Interdependencies have been demonstrated at least in a subset of transcription factors resulting in contributions to binding affinity that are both interdependent and non-additive <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B10\">10</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B12\">12</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B13\">13</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Position weight matrix scores have also been experimentally shown to be a poor predictor of binding affinities in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B7\">7</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B14\">14</abbr> </abbrgrp>.</p> <p> <it>Nkx2.2 </it>is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in the ventral neural tube, intestine and pancreas <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B15\">15</abbr> </abbrgrp>. A consensus sequence (T(t/c)AAGT(a/g)(c/g)TT) has been identified by SELEX and a corresponding PWM was generated and deposited in the TRANSFAC database <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B16\">16</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, experiences in our lab and others have shown that the predictive power of this PWM is low. More recently, Berger et al. <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr> </abbrgrp> generated a PWM for <it>Nkx2.2 </it>using protein binding microarray (PBM) technology. PBMs use a mathematically constructed set of oligos to quantitatively measure protein-DNA binding for all possible octamers. This should, in theory, result in a PWM that is more information rich than those constructed by other methods.</p> <p>Here, we show the results of an in-depth analysis of the PBM data for <it>Nkx2.2</it>. The original <it>Nkx2.2 </it>consensus sequence contains an invariable \"AAGT\" core. We have identified an alternative low-affinity core sequence with a wobble in the first position to contain \"GAGT\". We also mapped the PBM data directly to the genome to identify putative <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding sites. Using this method, we identified 111 novel <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding sites within the proximal promoters of genes differentially expressed in wildtype and <it>Nkx2.2 </it>null pancreata and confirmed approximately 90% of these sites by EMSA and/or ChIP analysis. Six of the sites confirmed by EMSA and ChIP contain the alternative \"GAGT\" core sequence. We also show that using a moving average of E-scores from the protein binding microarrays to predict relative binding affinity outperformed both the TRANSFAC PWM and the PBM-based PWM. Since the PBM-based PWM and the method described in this study rely on the same input data, these results show that the assumptions used to generate PWMs do not accurately describe <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding. Therefore, creating genome-wide maps by directly using experimental data will greatly increase the specificity and sensitivity of transcription factor binding site (TFBS) predictions over statistical models. Furthermore, these experiments revealed a gene battery that includes a large number of genes required for insulin secretion functions in the &#946;-cell that is controlled by <it>Nkx2.2</it>. We demonstrate that this same method can be adapted to other transcription factors. Based on these findings, we propose that PBM-mapping can be used to create composite TFBS maps across the entire genome. Such a map would greatly aid in the identification of <it>cis</it>-regulatory elements and the understanding of gene regulation.</p> </sec> <sec> <st> <p>Results</p> </st> <sec> <st> <p>Identification of an alternative Nkx2.2 binding site core sequence</p> </st> <p> <it>Nkx2.2 </it>was previously shown to specifically bind a 10 base-pair sequence containing an invariable \"AAGT\" core sequence flanked by several less conserved bases <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B16\">16</abbr> </abbrgrp>. To date, only two <it>in vivo </it>binding sites (in the <it>insulin2 </it>and <it>MafA </it>promoters) identified using this sequence have been successfully verified <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B17\">17</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B18\">18</abbr> </abbrgrp>. One possible explanation for the low predictive power of this consensus sequence is that it does not completely encompass the possible binding motifs for <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding. More recently, Berger et al. <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr> </abbrgrp> published a protein binding microarray (PBM) analyzing the binding affinity of the <it>Nkx2.2 </it>homeodomain. PBMs generate an enrichment score (E-score) with a range from -0.5 (low affinity) to 0.5 (high affinity) for every possible 8-base combination based on the relative intensity readouts from microarray data <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B19\">19</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Therefore, it has the potential to be more information rich than other methods because it allows for complete coverage of possible binding sequences and provides quantitative binding results. We used this data as a basis to identify additional <it>Nkx2.2 </it>DNA binding motifs.</p> <p>We first selected and analyzed all <it>Nkx2.2</it>-bound octamers with an E-score greater than 0.45 (132 octamers, Figure <figr fid=\"F1\">1A</figr>). Of these, 96 (73%) contained the previously published \"AAGT\" core sequence or its reverse complement. Of the remaining 36 octamers, 33 (25% of the total) had an alternative sequence \"GAGT.\" Three octamers did not contain either core sequence. We next calculated the average E-score for octamers containing AAGT and octamers containing GAGT. The average of all possible octamers was used as a baseline control. AAGT and GAGT containing octamers had a mean E-score value of 0.197 and 0.160, respectively, which are significantly greater (P &lt;&lt; 0.001) than the mean for all possible octamers (-0.029).</p> <fig id=\"F1\"><title><p>Figure 1</p></title><caption><p><it>Nkx2.2 </it>binds to the alternative core sequence \"GAGT\"</p></caption><text>    <p><b><it>Nkx2.2 </it>binds to the alternative core sequence \"GAGT\"</b>.

In order to identify the effect of two adjacent cores on Nkx2.2 binding, we analyzed these \"dual-core\" octamers (Additional File <supplr sid=\"S1\">1</supplr>). Dual-core octamers for Nkx2.2 binding can be divided into 4 groups based on which core sequence (AAGT or GAGT) is included and their relative orientation (inline or reverse compliment). Interestingly, all octamers containing two cores in the reverse compliment orientation had E-scores &gt; 0.45 while octamers with inline cores had E-scores &lt; 0.37, independent of which cores were contained in the octamer.</p> <suppl id=\"S1\"> <title> <p>Additional file 1</p> </title> <text> <p> <b>Analysis of Dual Core Sites</b>. Octamers containing two adjacent 4-bp core sequences were divided into groups based on content (2 identical cores or a mixture of AAGT and GAGT cores) and relative orientation (inline or reverse complement). Corresponding E-scores form PBM analysis are also shown. Octamers with two reverse complement cores consistently have higher E-scores than inline octamers regardless of content.</p> </text> <file name=\"1471-2105-12-62-S1.PDF\">    <p>Click here for file</p> </file> </suppl> <p>The two identified core sequence motifs differ only in the first position. In order to determine whether significant enrichment could be achieved with the other two possible first position bases, we plotted a histogram of the number of occurrences of each possible base in the first position for all E-scores (Figure <figr fid=\"F1\">1B</figr>). We found that there is a significant enrichment of only the AAGT and GAGT core sequences.</p> <p>To experimentally test the alternative GAGT binding site, we performed Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) experiments using the previously published <it>Nkx2.2 </it>consensus sequence as a baseline probe <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B16\">16</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B20\">20</abbr> </abbrgrp> (Figure <figr fid=\"F1\">1C</figr>). We mutated this probe to contain the alternative GAGT core sequence (max E-score = 0.48593, PBM-mapping score = 0.43038) and compared binding to both the original consensus probe (max E-score = 0.49841, PBM-mapping score = 0.46186) and a probe with a deleted core sequence (max E-score = 0.11739, PBM-mapping score = 0.05029). The GAGT containing probe showed significant binding with <it>in vitro </it>translated <it>Nkx2.2 </it>(TNT <it>Nkx2.2</it>) or nuclear extract from pancreatic cell lines with or without exogenously expressed <it>Nkx2.2</it>, although binding was weaker than the AAGT containing probe. Taken together, these experiments show that GAGT represents an alternative core sequence for <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding sites, although its relative binding affinity is lower than the canonical AAGT core sequence.</p> </sec> <sec> <st> <p>Identification of Novel Endogenous Nkx2.2 Binding Sites Using Protein Binding Microarray Mapping</p> </st> <p>Several methods to predict genomic transcription factor binding sites using PBM data have been developed. The most common methods rely on PWM creation by the \"seed-and-wobble\" algorithm or parametric methods <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B19\">19</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B21\">21</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, these methods are limited by the inaccuracies of the PWM model. E-scores of single octamers have also been suggested to be correlated with transcription factor binding affinity, suggesting that they might be able to be directly used to predict binding sites <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B3\">3</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, the dataset of E-scores has been shown to be somewhat noisy <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B21\">21</abbr> </abbrgrp>. In order to compensate for dataset noise, Grove et al. <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B22\">22</abbr> </abbrgrp> used an average of 3 E-scores based on a perfectly conserved core sequence (the AvgES method). However, we show in this study that the core sequence may not be completely conserved. Therefore, we sought to develop a novel algorithm that utilizes a moving average of E-scores for overlapping octamers to predict endogenous <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding sites without the bias for PWM-derived consensus core sequences and with more overlapping octamers than were used in the AvgES method (Figure <figr fid=\"F2\">2</figr>). We refer to this method as PBM-mapping. Briefly, E-scores are mapped to each octamer in the genome and a moving average of several overlapping octamers is calculated. We experimentally determined that using a moving average of 7 octamers predicted binding affinity with the greatest accuracy (see below and Figure <figr fid=\"F2\">2B</figr>). Sequences with a moving average higher than a determined threshold are then deposited into a database that can be queried to identify putative sites. We show by DNA binding assays that the threshold should be set to approximately 0.37 for <it>Nkx2.2</it>, although this threshold may vary for other transcription factors (see below).</p> <fig id=\"F2\"><title><p>Figure 2</p></title><caption><p>Transcription factor binding site prediction using PBM mapping</p></caption><text>    <p><b>Transcription factor binding site prediction using PBM mapping</b>.

Complete analysis of the genome resulted in 3 &#215; 10<sup>6 </sup>predicted sites, which falls within range of the expected number of binding sites in the genome for a single transcription factor, based on statistical probability of the sequence occurring in the genome. In order to investigate sites that are most likely to be biologically relevant, we selected sites within regulatory regions from 2.5 kb upstream to 1 kb downstream of the transcription start site of 35 genes with expression levels significantly (P &#8804; 0.05) changed in <it>Nkx2.2 </it>null embryos <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B23\">23</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B24\">24</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B25\">25</abbr> </abbrgrp>.

We did not include the Nkx6.2 -1441, Nkx6.2 +1669, Irs4 +1495 and Tm4sf4 +912 sites in this analysis because they fell in low complexity regions, which hindered the design of appropriate primers.

Therefore, the ideal TFBS prediction algorithm would generate a score that is highly correlated with transcription factor binding affinity. It has been proposed that the E-score from PBM experiments is indicative of relative binding affinity and preliminary experiments have shown correlation between individual octamer E-scores and binding affinity <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B3\">3</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B21\">21</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Therefore, in order to test whether single octamer and average E-scores are correlated with relative <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding affinity, we quantified the fraction bound for each site in the EMSA analysis (normalized to the probe with the largest bound fraction) and graphed it against single E-scores for the highest octamer and averages of 3, 5, 6, 7 or 8 oligos (Additional File <supplr sid=\"S3\">3</supplr>). The fractional occupancy of a transcription factor bound to a DNA binding site is indicative of the relative binding affinities of the ligands <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B27\">27</abbr> </abbrgrp>. The average of 7 overlapping scores showed the highest correlation with relative binding affinity (r-squared = 0.666) and outperformed both the TRANSFAC PWM score (r-squared = 0.305) and the PBM seed and wobble matrix score (r-squared = 0.604) (Figure <figr fid=\"F4\">4</figr>). In order to confirm the correlation between the PBM-mapping score and biochemically-derived binding affinity values, we analyzed 22 binding-sites with K<sub>d </sub>values that were determined for the <it>Nkx2.2 </it>drosophila homolog, <it>vnd </it> <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B28\">28</abbr> </abbrgrp>.

However, PBM mapping predicted a site 328 bases upstream of the previously published site that was confirmed by EMSA (Ins2 -477, Figure <figr fid=\"F3\">3A</figr>). ChIP analysis showed <it>Nkx2.2 </it>occupancy with primers for both the published and the newly predicted site, although occupancy appeared to be stronger on the PBM-mapping predicted site (Figure <figr fid=\"F3\">3B</figr>). Although the ChIP results are unable to completely distinguish between occupancy of both sites because of their close proximity relative to the DNA fragmentation size, it is also possible that <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binds the Ins2 -144 site through cooperative binding with cofactors that would not have been detected by EMSA analysis using <it>in vitro </it>translated <it>Nkx2.2</it>. Therefore, we performed additional EMSA analysis using &#946;TC6 nuclear extract (Figure <figr fid=\"F6\">6</figr>, Additional File <supplr sid=\"S5\">5</supplr>).

To date, the majority of methods to detect these sites have focused on creating statistical models, such as position weight matrices, of transcription factor specificities. However, these models are limited due to the fact that they must make generalized assumptions about transcription factor binding properties that are not completely understood. Other recent technologies have been developed such as ChIP-Seq to look at genomic transcription factor occupancy <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B31\">31</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, these technologies do not identify the precise binding sites, are technically difficult, and limited by the lack of high quality antibodies for many transcription factors. Therefore, bioinformatic prediction of transcription factor binding sites remains a powerful and useful tool for understanding transcriptional regulation. In this paper, we propose a modified technique for creating genome-wide TFBS site maps using direct mapping of protein binding microarray data (PBM-mapping). This method is technically simpler than ChIP-seq methods and does not rely on the assumptions used in statistical models.</p> <p>We have shown that PBM-mapping more accurately predicts relative binding affinity than previously reported TRANSFAC or PBM based PWMs. PWM inaccuracies have been attributed to both experimental and theoretical errors <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B32\">32</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Our studies support both of these limitations. The TRANSFAC PWM was developed from the alignment of 23 sequences enriched using SELEX experiments. The PBM-PWM was based on microarray experiments, which provide data for all possible octamers. In our experiments, the PBM-PWM was more highly correlated with observed relative binding affinity than the TRANSFAC PWM, most likely due to the increased information content in the PBM-PWM. However, PBM-mapping scores correlated to a greater extent with relative binding affinity than either PWM method, even though it was generated from the same data used for the PBM-PWM. Therefore, the PWM statistical model does not accurately model <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding.</p> <p>Numerous methods for generating PWMs exist and there are several statistical corrections that can be applied to the PWM model, however accurately testing and comparing all of these corrections is technically difficult and therefore were outside the scope of this study <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B33\">33</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Predictions based on the combined results of more than one PWM could also be attempted. However, these predictions would still be susceptible to the limitations of the PWM model to account for the influence of neighboring nucleotides and flanking regions.</p> <p>A method for using the average E-score of 3 overlapping octamers surrounding a previously identified core sequence (AvgES) has been utilized for predicting binding sites in <it>C. elegans </it> <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B22\">22</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, this method was not fully tested for accuracy and is biased by the assumption of a completely conserved 4-basepair long core sequence. Our results show that using an average E-score from an increased number of overlapping octamers improved the accuracy of transcription factor binding site prediction. Interestingly, an average E-score of 7 overlapping octamers resulted in the highest correlation with relative binding affinity. This represents the greatest number of overlapping octamers possible with at least one base pair common between all oligos. <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding has been reported to be influenced by the flanking DNA sequence <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B16\">16</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B34\">34</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Therefore, the increase in accuracy is most likely due to accounting for the flanking regions; however, it may also be due to reductions in the inherent noise present from microarray quantification <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B21\">21</abbr> </abbrgrp>. It remains possible that bases outside of the 7 octamer window can affect binding affinity, although using a window larger than 7 overlapping octamers resulted in decreased accuracy. This may be due to limitations of using 8 bp long motifs for generation of PBM data. It remains to be seen if increasing the length of DNA-binding sequences used in the microarray based experiments to generate E-scores would further increase the accuracy of binding affinity prediction.</p> <p>We did not observe a large difference between the flanking regions of \"AAGT\" and \"GAGT\" containing sequences. Furthermore, both core sequences share common flanking regions in the octamers with the highest E-score (TC<b>AAGT</b>GG and TC<b>GAGT</b>GG). However, the magnitude of the effect that base substitutions in the flanking regions have of the overall score of the site differed between \"AAGT\" and \"GAGT\" containing sites. For example, conversion of \"G\" to \"C\" in the last position of the above mentioned octamers reduces the single octamer E-score of the \"AAGT\" site by 0.0038 and the \"GAGT\" site by 0.011, confirming that the bases in these positions are not independently additive, but are dependent on other bases in the binding site, even when these bases are not immediately adjacent.</p> <p>We tested PBM-mapping using the homeodomain transcription factor <it>Nkx2.2</it>. <it>Nkx2.2 </it>has been shown to act as both an activator and a repressor during pancreatic islet formation <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B23\">23</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B35\">35</abbr> </abbrgrp>. &#946;-cells are completely absent in the <it>Nkx2.2 </it>null embryo <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B15\">15</abbr> </abbrgrp>. There was also a corresponding decrease in many, but not all, &#946;-cell markers <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B25\">25</abbr> </abbrgrp>. However, it was unclear which of these genes were down-regulated due to direct transcriptional control by <it>Nkx2.2 </it>or because the &#946;-cell population was absent. We used PBM-mapping to predict novel <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding sites within bound promoters of genes differentially expressed between wildtype and <it>Nkx2.2 </it>null embryos. Interestingly, a large majority of differentially expressed genes had predicted sites, suggesting that between e12.5 and e13.5 the changes seen in the <it>Nkx2.2 </it>null pancreas are largely due to direct regulation by <it>Nkx2.2 </it>and not a cascade of downstream transcription factors. We were also able to predict binding sites in several &#946;-cell specific genes, including a battery of genes encoding proteins present in secretory vesicles, such as insulin, IAPP and ChgB that appear to be coordinately activated by <it>Nkx2.2</it>.</p> <p>Several studies have shown that relatively weak or secondary binding sites are biologically important <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B1\">1</abbr> <abbr bid=\"B2\">2</abbr> </abbrgrp>. These sites may create genomic binding profiles dependent on protein concentrations or they may differentially bind closely related transcription factors that share a common primary binding motif <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B3\">3</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Careful analysis of the PBM data for <it>Nkx2.2 </it>revealed a previously unidentified alternative \"GAGT\" binding site motif for <it>Nkx2.2</it>. GAGT containing sites were also represented in our predicted sites (Gcg -432, Iapp -1355, <it>Nkx2.2 </it>-716, and Tm4sf4 -1723)--confirming the ability of the algorithm to predict secondary sites. This is the first secondary motif that has been identified for an Nkx2 family member, although a unique secondary motif has been identified for <it>Nkx3.1 </it>(GTAC)<abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B3\">3</abbr> </abbrgrp>. PBM-mapping does not predict that Nkx2.2 binds the GTAC core sequence; however this is not surprising since the homeodomain sequences between Nkx2 and Nkx3 family members are not well conserved and the two protein families are known to preferentially bind different core sequences <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B36\">36</abbr> </abbrgrp>. Further research is necessary to determine whether the GAGT motif identified in this study is unique to <it>Nkx2.2 </it>or is shared among several Nkx2 genes.</p> <p>The importance of weak or secondary binding sites highlights the importance of finding a suitable threshold for determining positive prediction results. In our study, we set the threshold for putative <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding sites at 0.37 based on the results from our EMSA analysis. However, this may not accurately reflect <it>in vivo </it>binding. For example, the Gcg -1080 site, which had an average E-score just below our threshold, did not show binding in EMSA analysis (Figure <figr fid=\"F3\">3A</figr>), but appeared to be occupied in ChIP (Figure <figr fid=\"F3\">3B</figr>). Therefore, it is possible that our threshold is overly stringent or that <it>Nkx2.2 </it>binding to weak sites is dependent on the presence of cofactors. The appropriate threshold may also vary between cell types due to different expression levels of the transcription factor. Furthermore, our results show that the appropriate threshold for different transcription factors will differ.</p> </sec> <sec> <st> <p>Conclusions</p> </st> <p>Although our studies to test PBM-mapping mainly focused on <it>Nkx2.2</it>, we believe that it could be widely applied to other transcription factor binding sites. Homeodomain proteins generally bind to a motif with a strong 4-5 base pair core with less conserved flanking sequences <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B37\">37</abbr> </abbrgrp>; therefore, the PBM-mapping algorithm should be directly applicable to most homeodomain containing proteins. We also show that PBM-mapping can be applied to the nuclear receptor protein <it>Hnf4&#945;</it>, but with a different threshold score and number of overlapping octamers than <it>Nkx2.2</it>. Not surprisingly, this suggests that the different DNA-binding site profiles associated with each class of protein will necessitate modifying the number of overlapping octamers used in each analysis. This will especially apply to transcription factor classes that contain shorter or longer binding sites. For example, several zinc finger proteins are thought to have binding sites that contains a 3-base pair core, while some bHLH factors have a 6 bp core sequence <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B38\">38</abbr> </abbrgrp>. A shorter core sequence may rely more heavily on flanking sequences for binding specificity, which would require increased octamer coverage, whereas a longer core may be more self-contained and require fewer octamers for predictive coverage. Threshold values may also need to be adjusted for each protein analyzed. Therefore, adapting this method to other transcription factor families may require a training set of known binding sites to determine an appropriate threshold for each transcription factor. If previously identified binding sites are not available, a training set can be generated from a subset of PBM-mapping predicted sites that span a wide range of PBM-mapping scores, as was done in this study. Although small adaptations may be necessary, the application of this method to other transcription factors merits further investigation.</p> </sec> <sec> <st> <p>Methods</p> </st> <sec> <st> <p>Alternative Core Sequence Identification</p> </st> <p>All octamers with an E-score greater than 0.45 were selected from the protein binding microarray for <it>Nkx2.2 </it> <abbrgrp> <abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr> </abbrgrp>.
