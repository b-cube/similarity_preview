One example describes optimal inflation, the other optimal seasonal policy. Although the numerical examples are arbitrary in most respects, the results are consistent with three general conclusions: if the model is known, then intervention is desirable; even the qualitative aspects of optimal intervention are not obvious; and optimal intervention depends on the details of the model. The results are therefore reminiscent of the conclusions of second-best theory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2014 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{98F71066-D4AC-4962-85F1-C101FBD29879}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/aggregate-labor-supply</link><title>Aggregate Labor Supply</title><description>Macroeconomics has made tremendous advances following the introduction of labor supply into the field. Today, it is widely acknowledged that labor supply matters for many key economic issues, particularly for business cycles and tax policy analysis. However, the extent to which labor supply matters for such questions depends on the aggregate labor supply elasticity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthat is, the sensitivity of the time allocation between market and nonmarket activities. For several decades, the magnitude of the aggregate labor supply elasticity has been the subject of much debate. In this article, we review the debate and conclude that the elasticity of labor supply of the aggregate household is much higher than the elasticity of the identical households being aggregated.  The aggregate household utility function differs from the individuals\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd utility functions for the same reason that the aggregate production function differs from the individual firms\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd production functions being aggregated. The differences in individual and aggregate supply elasticities are what aggregation theory predicts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2012 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{EFA5B63B-7260-478C-8B32-C963BA5070C1}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/negative-equity-does-not-reduce-homeowners-mobility</link><title>Negative Equity Does Not Reduce Homeowners\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Mobility</title><description>Many researchers, policymakers, and pundits have argued that the housing crisis may harm labor markets because homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth are less likely to move to places that have productive job opportunities. I show that, in the available data, negative equity &lt;i&gt;does not&lt;/i&gt; make homeowners less mobile. In fact, homeowners who have negative equity are slightly &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; likely to move than homeowners who have positive equity.

We look at inequality in relation to various characteristics such as age, education, employment status, marital status, and whether households are late payers or include bankruptcy filers. We also look at economic mobility. We compare these variables in 2007 with their values in our earlier study in 1998.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2011 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{CA744A59-7081-4628-9722-D29DE8356456}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/asset-prices-liquidity-and-monetary-policy-in-the-search-theory-of-money</link><title>Asset Prices, Liquidity, and Monetary Policy in the Search Theory of Money</title><description>I present a search-based model in which money coexists with equity shares on a risky aggregate endowment. Agents can use equity as a means of payment, so shocks to equity prices translate into aggregate liquidity shocks that disrupt the mechanism of exchange. I characterize a family of optimal monetary policies, and find that the resulting equity prices are independent of monetary considerations. I also study monetary policies that target a constant, but nonzero, nominal interest rate, and find that to the extent that a financial asset is valued as a means to facilitate transactions, the asset\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds real rate of return will include a liquidity return that depends on monetary considerations. Through this liquidity channel, persistent deviations from an optimal monetary policy can cause the real prices of assets that can be used to relax trading constraints to exhibit persistent deviations from their fundamental values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Originally presented at the Thirty-fourth Annual Economic Policy Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and published as part of their conference proceedings (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis &lt;i&gt;Review&lt;/i&gt;, July/August 2010, &lt;i&gt;92&lt;/i&gt; (4), pp. 303-10).

With sample sizes that small, identification may not be possible even with correctly specified representations of the data. In this article, I investigate whether small samples are indeed a problem for some commonly used statistical representations. I compare three\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda vector autoregressive moving average (VARMA), an unrestricted state space, and a restricted state space\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthat are all consistent with the same prototype business cycle model. The statistical representations that I consider differ in the amount of a priori theory that is imposed, but all are correctly specified. I find that the identifying assumptions of VARMAs and unrestricted state space representations are too minimal: the range of estimates for statistics of interest for business cycle researchers is so large as to be uninformative.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2010 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{B4AEBCD3-1F9C-47CF-BB47-49DAE0B6DD6A}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/back-to-the-future-with-keynes</link><title>Back to the Future with Keynes</title><description>This article analyzes Keynes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEconomic Possibilities for our Grandchildren\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdan essay presenting Keynes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds views about economic growth into the 21st century\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfrom the perspective of modern growth theory. I find that the implicit theoretical framework used by Keynes to form his expectations about the 21st-century world economy is remarkably close to modern growth models, featuring a stable steady-state growth path driven by technological progress. On the other hand, Keynes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds forecast of employment in the 21st century is far off the mark, reflecting a mistaken view that the income elasticity of leisure is much higher than that of consumption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{7CB47926-06C6-4E19-BA28-EB11EBA53D09}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/if-exchange-rates-are-random-walks-then-almost-everything-we-say-about-monetary-policy-is-wrong</link><title>If Exchange Rates Are Random Walks, Then Almost Everything We Say About Monetary Policy Is Wrong</title><description>The key question asked by standard monetary models used for policy analysis is, How do changes in short-term interest rates affect the economy? All of the standard models imply that such changes in interest rates affect the economy by altering the conditional means of the macroeconomic aggregates and have no effect on the conditional variances of these aggregates. We argue that the data on exchange rates imply nearly the opposite: the observation that exchange rates are approximately random walks implies that fluctuations in interest rates are associated with nearly one-for-one changes in conditional variances and nearly no changes in conditional means. In this sense, standard monetary models capture essentially none of what is going on in the data. We thus argue that almost everything we say about monetary policy using these models is wrong.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{ED1A7484-BA84-41E7-8804-BAE0AE6E353B}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/modeling-great-depressions-the-depression-in-finland-in-the-1990s</link><title>Modeling Great Depressions: The Depression in Finland in the 1990s</title><description>This article is a primer on the great depressions methodology developed by Cole and Ohanian (1999, 2007) and Kehoe and Prescott (2002, 2007). We use growth accounting and simple dynamic general equilibrium models to study the depression that occurred in Finland in the early 1990s. We find that the sharp drop in real GDP over the period 1990\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd93 was driven by a combination of a drop in total factor productivity (TFP) during 1990\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd92 and of increases in taxes on labor and consumption and increases in government consumption during 1989\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd94, which drove down hours worked in Finland.  We attempt to endogenize the drop in TFP in variants of the model with an investment sector and with terms-of-trade shocks but are unsuccessful.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2007 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{D2CFE9DE-FBDD-468E-9B5A-AFCF0F4519F7}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/on-the-needed-quantity-of-government-debt</link><title>On the Needed Quantity of Government Debt</title><description>People are enjoying longer retirement periods, and population growth is slowing and, in some countries, falling. In this article, we determine the implications of these demographic changes for the needed amount of government debt. If tax rates and the transfer share of gross national income (GNI) are both high, the needed debt is near zero. With such a system, however, huge deadweight losses are incurred as a result of the high tax rate on labor income. With a savings system, a large government debt to annual GNI ratio is needed. In a country with early retirement and no population growth, the needed government debt is as large as five times GNI, and welfare is as much as 24 percent higher in terms of lifetime consumption equivalents in the savings system relative to the tax-and-transfer system.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Nov 2007 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{A5E877BB-DBC8-4358-89DD-32813E33338E}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/early-state-banks-in-the-united-states-how-many-were-there-and-where-did-they-exist</link><title>Early State Banks in the United States: How Many Were There and Where Did They Exist?</title><description>This article describes a newly constructed data set of all U.S. state banks from 1782 to 1861.

The compilation is based on reported balance sheets, listings in banknote reporters, and secondary sources. Based on these data, the article presents a count of the number of banks and branches in business by state. I argue that my series are superior to previously existing ones for reasons of consistency, accuracy, and timing.

This article evaluates why Latin America has not replicated Western economic success. We find that this failure is primarily due to total factor productivity (TFP) differences. Latin America\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds TFP gap is not plausibly accounted for by human capital differences, but rather reflects inefficient production. We argue that competitive barriers are a promising channel for understanding low Latin TFP. We document that Latin America has many more international and domestic competitive barriers than do Western and successful East Asian countries. We also document a number of microeconomic cases in Latin America in which large reductions in competitive barriers increase productivity to Western levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reprinted from &lt;i&gt;Journal of Monetary Economics&lt;/i&gt;, Vol. 52, No. 1, Harold L.&lt;br/&gt;Cole, Lee E.

We show that inequality started to increase for men in 1974, and for women in 1981, and for both genders inequality continued to increase throughout 2002. During the same period the wage premium of college graduates over non-college workers increased substantially and the ratio of college educated workers to non-college workers also increased. These facts support the popular &lt;I&gt;skill-biased technical change (SBTC)&lt;/I&gt; hypothesis. However, other facts raise some doubts about the SBTC hypothesis. First, the college wage premium is mainly due to workers with a postgraduate degree, but their increase in the labor force started much earlier than the spectacular rise in their wages. Also there has been no marked change in recent decades in the occupational distribution of workers. However, the earning premium of professional over blue collar workers followed the same trend as the college earning premium. And finally, the most dramatic changes in the labor market took place among women.</description><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2004 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{736780AD-C173-4033-9C09-1D1DCE5FA912}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/changes-in-hours-worked-19502000</link><title>Changes in Hours Worked, 1950\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2000</title><description>This article describes changes in the number of average weekly hours of market work per person in the United States since World War II.

The article provides a detailed look at how the lifetime pattern of work hours has changed since 1950 for different demographic groups. This article also documents several factors that lead to the reallocation of hours worked across groups: increases in relative wages of females to males; technological innovations that shift female labor from the home to the market; increases in Social Security benefits to retired workers; and changes in family structure. The data presented are based on those collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census during the 1950\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2000 decennial censuses.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2004 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{6354CC9E-8838-4F46-9287-709DDD22FB69}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/why-do-americans-work-so-much-more-than-europeans</link><title>Why Do Americans Work So Much More Than Europeans?</title><description>Americans now work 50 percent more than do the Germans, French, and  Italians. This was not the case in the early 1970s, when the Western  Europeans worked more than Americans. This article examines the role of taxes in accounting for the differences in labor supply across time and across countries; in particular, the effective marginal tax rate on labor income. The population of countries considered is the G-7 countries, which are major advanced industrial countries. The surprising finding is that this marginal tax rate accounts for the predominance of differences at points in time and the large change in relative labor supply over time.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2004 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{AC5DFFC2-4AE8-4611-B737-4C1F5215D3A6}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/measuring-consumption-growth-the-impact-of-new-and-better-products</link><title>Measuring Consumption Growth: The Impact of New and Better Products</title><description>This study describes how the U.S. government measures real consumption growth and how it tries to take account of a complicating factor: that the goods and services offered to consumers change over time; new products are introduced and old products are improved.

In U.S. micro data, the degree of price stickiness differs dramatically across consumption categories. This study exploits that diversity to ask whether popular measures of monetary shocks (for example, innovations in the federal funds rate) have the predicted effects. The study finds that they do not. Short-run responses of relative prices have the wrong sign. And monetary policy shocks seem to have persistent effects on both relative prices and relative quantities, rather than the transitory effects one would expect from differences in price flexibility across goods. The findings reject the joint hypothesis that the sticky-price models typically employed in policy analysis capture the U.S. economy and that commonly used monetary policy shocks represent exogenous shifts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Dec 2003 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{896A80CD-5DC5-4BD6-9A4F-41C9599F7639}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/how-severe-is-the-timeinconsistency-problem-in-monetary-policy</link><title>How Severe is the Time-Inconsistency Problem in Monetary Policy?</title><description>This study analyzes two monetary economies, a cash-credit good model and a&lt;br/&gt;limited-participation model.

Here we describe and demonstrate a simple methodology for determining which theories are the most promising. We show that a large class of models, including models with various frictions, are equivalent to a prototype growth model with time-varying efficiency, labor, and investment wedges that, at least on face value, look like time-varying productivity, labor taxes, and investment taxes. We use U.S. data to measure these wedges, feed them back into the prototype growth model, and assess the fraction of the fluctuations in 1929\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd39 that they account for. We find that the efficiency and labor wedges account for essentially all of the decline and subsequent recovery. Investment wedges play, at best, a minor role.

We study a natural experiment conducted in the iron ore industry as a result of the collapse in world steel production in the early 1980s. For iron ore producers, whose only market is the steel industry, this collapse was an exogenous shock. The drop in steel production differed dramatically by region: it fell by about a third in the Atlantic Basin but only very little in the Pacific Basin. Given that the cost of transporting iron ore is very high relative to its mine value, Atlantic iron ore producers faced a much greater increase in competitive pressure than did Pacific iron ore producers. In response to the crisis, most Atlantic iron ore producers doubled their labor productivity; Pacific iron ore producers experienced few productivity gains.

This study analyzes four possible explanations for this difference and rules out three, explanations based on money supply expansion, real wage and real exchange rate declines, and foreign debt overhangs. The fourth explanation is based on government policy reforms in the two countries. Using growth accounting and a calibrated growth model, the study determines that the only policy reforms promising as explanations are those that primarily affect total factor productivity, or how inputs are used, not the inputs themselves. Interpreting historical evidence with economic theory, the study concludes that the crucial difference between Chile and Mexico in the 1980s and 1990s is earlier government policy reforms in Chile, particularly reforms in policies affecting the banking system and bankruptcy procedures.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2002 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{9BAB28FB-9199-46E4-8C8D-973095769E88}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/in-this-issue-20021201</link><title>In This Issue</title><description /><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2002 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{F4E4C7F4-5519-4CB6-B41D-45633D4E4ED5}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/in-this-issue-20020901</link><title>In This Issue</title><description /><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2002 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{27C2054C-5C67-4736-9F49-E73C3524F0B5}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/lessons-from-a-laissezfaire-payments-system-the-suffolk-banking-system-182558-20020901</link><title>Lessons From a Laissez-Faire Payments  System: The Suffolk Banking System (1825-58)</title><description>A classic example of a privately created interbank payments system was operated by the Suffolk Bank of New England (1825\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd58). Known as the &lt;I&gt;Suffolk Banking System,&lt;/I&gt; it was the nation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds first regionwide net-clearing system for bank notes. While it operated, notes of all New England banks circulated at par throughout the region. Some have concluded from this experience that unfettered competition in the provision of payments services can produce an efficient payments system. But another look at the history of the Suffolk Banking System questions this conclusion. The Suffolk Bank earned extraordinary profits, and note-clearing may have been a natural monopoly. There is no consensus in the literature about whether unfettered operation of markets with natural monopolies produces an efficient allocation of resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study was originally published in the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Review (May/June 1998, vol. 80, no. 3, pp. 105\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd16).</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2002 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{7C486959-7FEE-4F1C-9E71-121EB1B1CFA9}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/money-and-inflation-in-colonial-massachusetts-20020901</link><title>Money and Inflation in Colonial Massachusetts</title><description>This article argues that the quantity theory of money is not supported by the evidence. Contrary to the quantity theory, the article says, the value of money depends primarily on how carefully it is backed. That is, the rate of inflation depends more on underlying fiscal policies than on rates of money growth. The evidence for this argument comes from a close look at the way in which the colony of Massachusetts ended a severe long-term inflation in 1750. Other British North American colonies endured similar episodes, all of which parallel some periods of severe inflation in the 20th century United States. The 18th century evidence thus contains lessons for modern monetary policy.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2002 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{00DC95F9-D653-4415-9844-1A63BC51A2B2}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/the-published-work-of-bruce-d-smith</link><title>The Published Work of Bruce D.

The evidence is primarily from the North American colonies of Virginia, New York, and Pennsylvania and regards the issue of measuring the money supply. Studies have shown that changes in colonial money and inflation are inconsistent with the quantity theory. Some have argued that those studies measure money wrong: specie belongs in the measure because the colonies were on a fixed exchange rate system with Britain; changes in colonial paper money were offset by specie flows. When specie is counted, the quantity theory stands. This study responds with evidence that the critics are wrong: the colonies had no such fixed exchange rate regime, and movements in the stock of colonial paper currency cannot have been offset by specie flows.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Sep 2002 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{B00EC677-3993-4FC9-A691-638FEA7304CD}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/updated-facts-on-the-us-distributions-of-earnings-income-and-wealth</link><title>Updated Facts on the U.S. Distributions of Earnings, Income, and Wealth</title><description>This article uses data from the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances and from recent waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to update a study of economic inequality in the United States based on 1992 and earlier data. The article reports data on the U.S. distributions of earnings, income, and wealth and on related features of inequality, such as age, employment status, educational attainment, and marital status. It also reports data on the economic inequality among U.S. households in financial trouble and on the economic mobility of U.S. households. The article finds that earnings, income, and wealth were very unequally distributed among U.S. households late in the 1990s, just as they had been at the beginning of the decade. It concludes that the basic facts about economic inequality in the United States did not change much during the 1990s.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2002 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{3B3111BA-8F2A-401E-87F3-0FB62B047099}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/inequality-and-fairness</link><title>Inequality and Fairness</title><description>This study uses John Rawls\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd behind-the-veil of ignorance device as a fairness criterion to evaluate social policies and applies it to a contracting model in which the terms &lt;I&gt;equality of opportunity&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;equality of result&lt;/I&gt; are well defined. The results suggest that fairness and inequality\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeven extreme inequality\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdare compatible. In a static world, when incentives must be provided, fairness implies equality of opportunity, but inequality of result. In a dynamic world of long-lived individuals, fairness implies not only inequality of result, but also, eventually, infinite inequality of result. If each period of the dynamic model is interpreted as a generation, then eventual infinite inequality holds for opportunity as well, as long as fairness is from the perspective of the first generation. If preferences of later generations are taken into account, then inequality of opportunity still occurs, although not at extreme levels.</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Apr 2002 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{3546A3A0-4C93-418E-9385-1A2A48050843}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/why-did-productivity-fall-so-much-during-the-great-depression</link><title>Why Did Productivity Fall So Much During the Great Depression?</title><description>This study assesses five common explanations for the large decline in U.S. total factor productivity (TFP) during the Great Depression: changes in capacity utilization, factor input quality, and production composition; labor hoarding; and increasing returns to scale. The study finds that these factors explain less than one-third of the 18 percent TFP decline between 1929 and 1933. The rest of the decline remains unexplained. The study offers a potential explanation: declines in &lt;I&gt;organization capital,&lt;/I&gt; the knowledge firms use to organize production, caused by breakdowns in relationships between firms and their suppliers, for example. As some firms failed during the Depression, efficiency in surviving firms decreased; managers had to shift time away from production in order to establish new relationships, and firms had to shift to unfamiliar technologies that initially were operated inefficiently.

These models are based on the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (the NAIRU). The study compares the accuracy, over the last 15 years, of three sets of inflation forecasts from NAIRU models to the naive forecast that at any date inflation will be the same over the next year as it has been over the last year. The conventional wisdom is wrong; none of the NAIRU forecasts is more accurate than the naive forecast. The likelihood of accurately predicting a change in the inflation rate from these three forecasts is no better than the likelihood of accurately predicting a change based on a coin flip. The forecasts include those from a textbook NAIRU model, those from two models similar to Stock and Watson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds, and those produced by the Federal Reserve Board.</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Dec 2001 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{0078B9D5-4AA7-403F-99C1-28C3BF0F482B}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/thoughts-on-the-feds-role-in-the-payments-system</link><title>Thoughts on the Fed\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Role in the Payments System</title><description>This essay concerns how the Federal Reserve\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds role as a payment services provider can best be aligned with its broad mission to foster the integrity, efficiency, and accessibility of the U.S. payments system. A recommended strategy involves specialization in providing services where the central bank has a comparative advantage\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnotably, services directly related to providing a comprehensive, secure system of accounts for interbank settlement and potentially some additional services justified by economies of scope. If markets for other payment services evolve as expected, the recommended strategy would have the Fed generally rely on means other than direct service provision to help ensure that services are provided effectively and equitably. Several specific implications of this strategy are suggested.

Data since 1960 for about 40 countries support the &lt;i&gt;Fisher equation view,&lt;/i&gt; that these variables are positively related. But studies taking expectations into account support the &lt;i&gt;liquidity effect view,&lt;/i&gt; that they are negatively related. A simple model incorporates both views and demonstrates that which view applies at any time depends on when the change in money occurs and how long the public expects it to last. A surprise money change that is not expected to change future money growth moves interest rates in the opposite direction; one that is expected to change future money growth moves interest rates in the same direction. The study also demonstrates that stating monetary policy as a rule for interest rates rather than money does not change the relationship between these variables.</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2001 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{B0DEC478-4FD8-47CC-A9AF-6DA837B36CE6}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/some-monetary-facts-20010901</link><title>Some Monetary Facts</title><description>This article describes three long-run monetary facts derived by examining data for 110 countries over a 30-year period, using three definitions of a country's money supply and two subsamples of countries: (1) Growth rates of a country's money supply and the general price level are highly correlated for all three money definitions, for the full sample of countries, and for both subsamples.

Hyperinflation is common in a divided society, one in which special interest groups can pressure a weak central government to issue money to finance their own demands while neglecting the country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds overall welfare. A commitment device like dollarization or a currency board, which gives control of the divided country\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds money supply to another country, can eliminate this inflation bias. This is illustrated by Argentina\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds experience with inflation and a currency board which, in effect, gave control of Argentina\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds money supply to the United States. This argument is made precise using a two-country overlapping generations model to study the effects of delegation. The study also finds that a dollarization treaty between the two countries can be welfare-improving for both.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2001 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{00D59543-4C03-45A2-A189-F2C55D3DDA0E}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/looking-for-evidence-of-timeinconsistent-preferences-in-asset-market-data</link><title>Looking for Evidence of Time-Inconsistent Preferences in Asset Market Data</title><description>This study argues that strong evidence contradicting the traditional assumption of time-consistent preferences is not available. The study builds and analyzes the implications of a deterministic general equilibrium model and compares them to data from the U.S. asset market. The model implies that (1) because of dynamic arbitrage, the prices of retradable assets cannot reveal whether preferences are time-inconsistent; but (2) the prices of commitment assets, investments which must be held for their lifetime, can. These prices will be higher than the present values of their future payoffs only when preferences are time-inconsistent. And (3) when preferences are time-inconsistent, people will not hold both retradable and commitment assets. Empirical observations on two examples of commitment assets\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeducation and individual retirement accounts\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdare not consistent with these model implications.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jul 2001 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{7A3837EB-6412-4495-BA23-184B5A2FE72F}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/competition-at-work-railroads-vs-monopoly-in-the-us-shipping-industry</link><title>Competition at Work: Railroads vs. Monopoly in the U.S. Shipping Industry</title><description>This study primarily establishes two things: (1) that monopoly has been pervasive in the U.S. water transportation industry in both the 19th and 20th centuries and has led to prices above competitive levels and the adoption of inefficient technologies and (2) that the competition of railroads has greatly weakened this monopolistic tendency, leading to lower water transport prices and fewer inefficient technologies. The study establishes these points using standard economic theory and extensive historical U.S. data on the behavior of unions and shipping companies. These gains from competition have been ignored by researchers studying the contribution of railroads to U.S. economic growth. Researchers have assumed that if railroads had not been developed, the long-distance transportation industry would have been competitive. This study shows that it would not have been. The quantitative estimates of previous studies thus are likely to have significantly understated the gains from the development of railroads.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2001 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{96129F61-FC37-4D4A-8814-934DED29B27C}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/in-this-issue-20010401</link><title>In This Issue</title><description /><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2001 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{E9B0B15F-3B7A-4FE2-AE38-04840BAB8EE8}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/bank-runs-deposit-insurance-and-liquidity</link><title>Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity</title><description>This article develops a model which shows that bank deposit contracts can provide allocations superior to those of exchange markets, offering an explanation of how banks subject to runs can attract deposits. Investors face privately observed risks which lead to a demand for liquidity. Traditional demand deposit contracts which provide liquidity have multiple equilibria, one of which is a bank run. Bank runs in the model cause real economic damage, rather than simply reflecting other problems. Contracts which can prevent runs are studied, and the analysis shows that there are circumstances when government provision of deposit insurance can produce superior contracts. &lt;br/&gt;This article is reprinted from the &lt;I&gt;Journal of Political Economy&lt;/I&gt; (June 1983, vol. 91, no. 3, pp. 401\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd19) with the permission of the University of Chicago Press.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2000 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{CCADF722-1808-40D1-BC25-9DC9A2E5D27E}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/diamond-and-dybvigs-classic-theory-of-financial-intermediation-whats-missing</link><title>Diamond and Dybvig\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Classic Theory of Financial Intermediation: What\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Missing?</title><description>The article shows that in a finite-trader version of the Diamond and Dybvig model (1983), the ex ante efficient allocation can be implemented as a unique equilibrium.

Some stockmarket analysts have argued that the market is overvalued at this level. We use a growth model with an explicit corporate sector and find that the market is correctly valued. In theory, the market value of equity plus debt liabilities should equal the value of productive  assets plus debt assets. Since the net value of debt is currently low, the market value of equity should be approximately equal to the market value of productive assets. We find that the market value of productive assets, including both tangible and intangible assets and assets used  outside the country by U.S. subsidiaries, is currently about 1.8 times GNP, the same as the market value of equity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2000 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{2EFA4B16-855B-4720-9D3A-A9E2642B722E}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/the-declining-us-equity-premium</link><title>The Declining U.S. Equity Premium</title><description>This study demonstrates that the U.S. equity premium has declined significantly during the last three decades. The study calculates the equity premium using a variation of a formula in the classic Gordon stock valuation model. The calculation includes the bond yield, the stock dividend yield, and the expected dividend growth rate, which in this formulation can change over time. The study calculates the premium for several measures of the aggregate U.S. stock portfolio and several assumptions about bond yields and stock dividends and gets basically the same result. The premium averaged about 7 percentage points during 1926\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd70 and only about 0.7 of a percentage point after that. This result is shown to be reasonable by demonstrating the roughly equal returns that investments in stocks and consol bonds of the same duration would have earned between 1982 and 1999, years when the equity premium is estimated to have been zero.</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2000 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid isPermaLink=\"false\">{FE8B0255-8B32-4B1D-9CC4-4624A52B59F2}</guid><link>https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/quarterly-review/creating-business-cycles-through-credit-constraints</link><title>Creating Business Cycles Through Credit Constraints</title><description>Business cycles appear to be large, persistent, and asymmetric relative to the shocks hitting the economy.
