For many companies, improving supply chain management offers the largest opportunity for achieving increased sustainability performance \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd particularly in addressing issues of labor and human rights abuse. In the 1990s, the issue of human rights and supply chains became front-page news after child labor scandals in the apparel industry surfaced. As a result, customers, investors and regulators increasingly want to know that the products they purchase and underwrite are not causing undue harm to communities near and far. This three-part podcast series focuses on the ethics of supply chain management and the evolving impacts on human rights. <br /><br />With the recent explosion in the market of computers, cellphones, tablets and more, human rights and corporate supply chains are once again in the limelight as the mining of minerals needed for our handheld devices have helped fuel conflict and bloodshed in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</p> <p>This episode looks at a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule requiring all companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose the origin of four key minerals\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtin, tungsten, tantalum and gold.

Last year was marked by record-setting economic losses equaling USD$148 billion due to extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts and fires. And these events are expected to occur with more frequency as global greenhouse gas levels increase, meaning bigger economic losses in the future. <br /><br />Companies and investors face significant risks from these changing weather patterns. Recent guidelines set forth by the SEC require companies to disclose risks brought on by the effects of climate change. As a result, a growing group of institutional investors and public interest groups are asking companies to disclose these risks and the steps they are taking to minimize risk from climate-related disasters. <br /><br />Ceres, along with Oxfam America and Calvert Investments, released a new guide \"<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"../reports/physical-risks-from-climate-change/view\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Physical Risks from Climate Change: A guide for companies and investors on disclosure and management of climate impacts</i></a>\" to help improve corporate disclosure and management of financial impacts of climate change and help investors make more informed investment decisions.

But by law, Utah didn't allow large energy consumers to buy and transmit power directly from renewable energy developers, leaving eBay with the choice of sourcing their energy needs from coal (which powers 94% of the state), or not doing business in the state.</p> <p>But eBay didn't do either of those things. Instead, the company began working with legislators, energy providers and other energy-hungry companies to create a new law that would make renewable energy available to Utah energy consumers. The attempt, Senate Bill 12, will do just that -- enabling large energy consumers such as eBay, Twitter and Oracle to enter into long-term purchase agreements with alternative energy providers, as long as no costs are passed on to other rate-payers.</p> <p>The bill passed unanimously in the Utah Senate and House and will go into effect this summer. The legislation is being touted as a win-win for Utah's economy and the environment. eBay, which employs more than 1500 people in Utah alone, is already planning to build a second data center and adding nearly 2,200 jobs in the state. And other companies are taking a second look at Utah</p> <p>To get a better picture of this clean energy collaboration in the Beehive State, the Ceres Podcast spoke with Dean Nelson, senior director of Global Data Center Strategy and Operations at eBay and Senator Mark Madsen, a Republican State Senator from Tooele County, Utah and lead sponsor of Senate Bill 12.</p> <p>eBay is a member of Business for Innovative Climate &amp; Energy Policy (BICEP), which is a project of Ceres.

One of the concrete investments investors are eyeing is infrastructure. Specifically, renewable energy infrastructure. The renewable energy market is poised to explode in the coming years, and is already booming in countries like China, Brazil and Germany. And investors are eager to tap into it. Although a price on carbon -- which would give renewables the punctuated equilibrium needed to free up investment dollars and scale up new energy sources in the U.S. -- is currently on the back burner, the renewable energy market hasn't stalled out. It's not even slowing down.</p> <p>In this episode, Bill Green, Managing Director of Macquarie Capital's renewable infrastructure investing team explains the world of renewable energy infrastructure and makes the case for why scaling up the physical infrastructure for renewable energy is a good bet for investors even in the absence of an immediate price on carbon.</p> <p><span class=\"discreet\">[Music: Mr. Lif, \"Ol' Crew\" from Superrappin Vol. 2 Instrumental (Groove Attack, 2004); Guns and Roses, \"Rocket Queen\" from Appetite for Destruction (Geffen, 1987)]</span></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Brian Sant</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2010-08-05T07:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Resource</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ceres.org/resources/podcasts/in-hot-water-the-trouble-with-the-virtual-water-trade-and-the-role-of-corporations-investors-and-governments-in-solving-the-world-water-crisis\">     <title>In Hot Water: The Trouble with the Virtual Water Trade and the Role of Corporations, Investors and Governments in Solving the World Water Crisis. </title>     <link>http://www.ceres.org/resources/podcasts/in-hot-water-the-trouble-with-the-virtual-water-trade-and-the-role-of-corporations-investors-and-governments-in-solving-the-world-water-crisis</link>     <description>In this episode, we speak with Maude Barlow, National Chairperson of the Council of Canadians, about the virtual global water trade, how it affects local communities as well as multinational corporations and what companies, investors and governments need to do to avert the global water crisis.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h4>An interview with Maude Barlow, National Chairperson of the Council of Canadians</h4> <p><br /><img src=\"http://www.ceres.org/resources/podcasts/in_hot_water.jpg\" alt=\"In Hot Water\" class=\"image-left\" />(<i>June 29, 2010</i>) Water is essential for life, but it's also essential for our economy. We all use water for drinking, bathing, watering crops and gardens, and so on. But a surprising amount of water use is bound up in the products we purchase and consume from corporations. Chemical manufacturing, energy production, mineral extraction and commercial farming all require massive amounts of water to run viable businesses, and they often take water locally to make products that get sold internationally. But countries and companies have few contingency plans for what happens if this virtual trade in water runs dry -- which could happen sooner rather than later according to a recent World Bank report that predicts the demand of water will outstrip supply by 40% in the next 20 years.</p> <p>In this episode, we speak with Maude Barlow, National Chairperson of the Council of Canadians, about the virtual global water trade, how it affects local communities as well as multinational corporations and what companies, investors and governments need to do to avert the global water crisis.</p> <p><span class=\"discreet\">[Music: Madlib, \"Slim's Return\" from Shades of Blue (Blue Note, 2003);  Animal Collective, \"Brother Sport\" from Merriweather Post Pavilion  (Domino Recording, 2009), Photo: Flickr user <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pdkliment/\">pdkliment</a>]</span></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Brian Sant</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>rss</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2010-06-29T18:05:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Resource</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ceres.org/resources/podcasts/re-energizing-america\">     <title>Re-Energizing America: How Passing Climate and Energy Legislation Can Keep the U.S. Competitive in the Global Race for Energy</title>     <link>http://www.ceres.org/resources/podcasts/re-energizing-america</link>     <description>In this episode, we speak with Kevin Parker, Global Head of Deutsche Asset Management, about the need for a strong regulatory environment that will spur energy investment here in the U.S. instead of sending investment dollars outside our borders. </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<h4>An interview with Kevin Parker, Global Head of Deutsche Asset Management</h4> <p><br /><img src=\"http://www.ceres.org/resources/podcasts/ReEnergizing_America.jpg\" alt=\"Re-Energizing America\" class=\"image-left\" />(<i>May 25, 2010</i>) Almost a year after the U.S. House passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act and after months of planning and preparation, Senators John Kerry (D-MA) and Joe Lieberman (I-CT) released the American Power Act.
