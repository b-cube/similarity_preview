The data were obtained from the manuscript agricultural and population schedules of the 1860 United States Census. Variables include farm values, livestock inventories, and crop production figures for the households that owned or operated farms (over half the households in the study), as well as values of real and personal estate, color, sex, age, literacy, school attendance, occupation, place of birth, and parents' nationality of all individuals residing in the sampled households.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1860\" cycle=\"P1\">1860</timePrd>                                         <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>956 counties in 20 northern states</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A two-stage variable-cluster sample design was used. A   random sample of 102 counties in 16 northern states was drawn. From   each of these counties one nonurban township was randomly selected.   Census records from all households in the selected townships were  included in the study.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          United States Manuscript Censuses, 1860             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 In this hierarchical dataset each household has three separate record types. There is one \"A\" record per household, containing farm and livestock statistics, . Each household has one or more \"B\" records, which provide information on crop production, and one or more \"C\" records, containing demographic information on household members. For the total sample of 21,118 households, there are three or more records per case, depending on the number of \"B\" and \"C\" records for a given household. There are 16 variables for the \"A\" records, a maximum of approximately 77 variables for the \"B\" records, and a minimum of five variables for the \"C\" records. An earlier version of this collection, AGRICULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NORTH, 1860 (ICPSR 7420), is available in rectangular format.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR09117.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
