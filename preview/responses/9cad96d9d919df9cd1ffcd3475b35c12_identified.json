A group of eight intertidal creeks with high densities of oysters were studied using a replicated BACI (Before - After Control - Incident) design in which all creeks are sampled simultaneously.  By the fall of 1996, based on preliminary geomorphological observations of North Inlet creeks, eight creeks similar in size and configuration were selected and a survey was conducted to estimate the oyster biomass in each creek.  In January of 1997, oysters were added or removed from each creek to equalize oyster biomass at 8 grams dry body weight per cubic meter of bank full water volume.  This marked the beginning of the \"pre-manipulation year\" and the collection of baseline data.  Nutrients and chlorophyll a were measured weekly in each creek and exhibited seasonal and inter-annual influences.  Phytoplankton pigment levels were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Intensive planktonic - microbial loop and nekton abundance and biomass samplings were conducted seasonally.  Oyster growth and survival were measured monthly and information was gathered on the dispersal of the oyster parasite Perkinsus marinus.  A habitat survey was also conducted in January of 1998 to categorize the creek bottom types for the database.  In February of 1998, oysters were removed from 4 of the 8 creeks (creeks 1, 4, 5, and 8) and collection of the same data for the \"manipulation year\" began.  In May of 2000, a final biomass estimate was performed to determine if oyster recruitment and trampling during sampling activities had altered oyster biomass during the manipulation phase of the study. In the tidal creeks of North Inlet Estuary, the Eastern oyster C. virginica is an abundant component of the benthic macrofauna and exerts controls on microbial communities through its grazing and nutrient regenerative activities.  This subcomponent of the CREEK Project (overview above) focused on the effect that oysters have on another important element of the tidal creek system, the phytoplankton community.  Investigators used HPLC to analyze the pigments present in selected weekly water samples gathered from control and experimental creek sites, before and after manipulation, for water chemistry analyses.  Pigment levels can then be extrapolated to provide information on the types and abundance of phytoplankton in these creeks over the course of seasons and years, and in the presence and absence of oysters. </abstract> <purpose> The CREEK Phytoplankton Pigment Monitoring Subproject was initiated in January of 1997 to explore the effect of oysters on the types and abundance of phytoplankton present in eight tidal creeks in the North Inlet Estuary system, Georgetown, South Carolina. </purpose> <supplinf> Related Publications and Presentations: Impact of the Eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica on microbial community structure in a salt marsh estuary.

Other Creek Datasets: Several other datasets were collected as subcomponents of the CREEK Project over varying periods during the four year study.  Oyster biomass data were collected to determine the natural average biomass of oysters within intertidal creeks.  All creeks were then adjusted to that average level.  A year later, all live oysters were removed from 4 of the creeks, for the \"manipulation year\", and changes in biomass were estimated for the creeks that were not manipulated.  A final oyster biomass survey was conducted approximately two years after manipulation.  The geomorphology dataset contains detailed geomorphological observations made of each creek near the beginning of the study.  A habitat survey was conducted manually to determine bottom type classifications for every square meter of each creek.  The water chemistry dataset contains weekly nutrient and chlorophyll a measurements for each creek, throughout the study.  Intensive planktonic - microbial loop sampling and experiments were conducted in selected creeks seasonally as part of the microzooplankton study.  The nekton dataset included seasonal collections of all nekton in creeks during bankfull neap tides during two years of the project, one pre-manipulation year and one post-manipulation year. Oyster growth and survival were measured monthly during the same period of nekton collections.  Infection intensities of the oyster parasite, Perkinsus marinus, were made in fall of the pre-manipulation year and once following the manipulation for the oyster disease dataset.  See the Creek Project Overview documentation for more information on these datasets and additional subprojects, undergraduate and graduate research projects, publications, and presentations. Summary of Important CREEK Project Results: The phototrophic nanoflagellates (pflags) were found to vary significantly with the presence of oyster reefs which were 1.25- to 2.25-fold less abundant in creeks with oyster reefs during the summer phytoplankton bloom.  The flume study demonstrated and confirmed preferential feeding by oysters on pflags. Although covering 25-70% (avg.40%) of intertidal creek bottoms, oysters do not dominate faunal biomass or the remineralization of nutrients. Totally unexpected was the finding that summer nekton (fishes, shrimps, crabs) biomass is higher than oyster biomass. Nekton prefer certain creeks to others and these distributions are related to creek shape, mean depth, flooding and discharge rate, and distance to upland ridge, but not creek size (volume, area, or length). A tag / recapture study by a student found that pinfish migrated into flooding creeks but did not move among creeks. El Ni&amp;ntilde;o, a global environmental event, was clearly evident from the analysis of three years of weekly chlorophyll and nutrient data (1997-2000). Utilizing limited literature values and preliminary experiments, a simple budget for ammonium indicated that nekton inputs were considerably greater than oyster excretion as a source to intertidal creeks.

In 1999 only water sample \"B\" was analyzed.  All samples analyzed are included in the final database.  Over the course of the database, two different trained technicians were responsible for HPLC analysis.  All values were calculated and compiled by one of these technicians.  Along with personnel changes, there were also changes in analysis software and the pigments that were isolated (see the Methodology Section of this document).  However, the detector portion of the HPLC apparatus, which determines sensitivity/accuracy, did NOT change during sample analysis for this database.  Detector specifications are included below.  Information on Anomalous/Erroneous data may be found in the Completeness Report below.

The 2004 Data Rescue Manager removed all zero peak areas and ng/ml values and replaced with missing data markers.  Rf values were also replaced with missing data markers since the sample was never run. 03/16/1999, samples 1B - 7B, all pigments.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager attempted to track down the volumes filtered for these samples, but they were apparently not recorded.  As a result, Peak Areas and Rf values are reported, but concentrations could not be calculated.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager inserted missing data markers for all volumes and for all concentrations where the Peak Area was not zero.  Concentrations for zero Peak Areas were recorded as zero. 03/16/1999, sample 8B, all pigments.  There were no data reported for the Creek 8B sample and no evidence that the sample was ever analyzed.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager added a row for this sample and inserted missing data markers for the Volume, all Rf values, all Concentrations, and all Peak Areas. Chlorophyll C3: 01/13/1997 through 07/14/1999 (entire database), all samples, Chlorophyll C3.  Throughout the course of this database there was no response factor (no Rf value) available to calculate the concentration of the Chlorophyll C3 pigment.  However, for a portion of the database the Chlorophyll C3 pigment was isolated and Peak Areas are available in the Process Spreadsheet.  During this portion of the database, concentrations of zero ng/ml were reported in the final database when the measured peak area was zero. 03/25/1998 - 04/08/1998, Chlorophyll C3, all samples.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager replaced zero values for the Peak Area with missing data markers.  The C3 pigment was not isolated during this portion of the database.  Peak areas were improperly recorded as zeros by the Research Technician. 01/15/1999 through 07/14/1999, all samples, Chlorophyll C3.  Chlorophyll C3 was not isolated for these samples. Chlorophyll C1 and C2 (together): 03/25/1998 through 04/08/1998, all samples, Chlorophyll C1 and C2 (together).

Chlorophyll C1: 01/13/1997 through 02/17/1998, all samples, Chlorophyll C1.  Chlorophyll C1 was not isolated for these samples. 05/22/1998 through 10/20/1998, all samples, Chlorophyll C1.  Chlorophyll C1 was not isolated for these samples. Chlorophyll C2: 01/13/1997 through 02/17/1998, all samples, Chlorophyll C2.  Chlorophyll C2 was not isolated for these samples. 05/22/1998 through 10/20/1998, all samples, Chlorophyll C2.  Chlorophyll C2 was not isolated for these samples.

Diatoxanthin was not isolated for these samples. 09/30/1998, Diatoxanthin, all samples.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager replaced blank cells for the Rf values with missing data markers.  The 2004 Research Technician attempted to find any record of the values used to process these samples, but it appears that the Research Technician did not record them, probably because the pigment was not found to be present in these samples. 10/20/1998, all samples, Diatoxanthin.  Diatoxanthin was not isolated for these samples. Anomalous Data: 11/03/1997 - 02/17/1998 and 05/22/98 - 10/20/1998, Data Manager corrected erroneous data.  For this portion of the database, the Chlorophyll C3 pigment was isolated and Peak Areas were recorded, but all concentrations were reported as missing data.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager replaced all missing data markers for concentration values (ng/ml) corresponding to zero Peak Area values, with zeros.  While there was no Rf value (no response factor) available to calculate concentrations of Diatoxanthin where a Peak Area greater than zero was registered, if the Peak Area was zero, the concentration should also be recorded as zero, not as missing data. 07/13/1998, sample 4A:  Entire sample was noted as missing, but all pigment peak areas and ng/ml values were recorded as zero.  It is unclear whether the sample was lost, compromised, or never collected.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager removed all zero peak areas and ng/ml values and replaced with missing data markers.  Rf values and the volume were also replaced with missing data markers since the sample was never run. 08/03/1998, samples TCa, TCb, CBa, and CBb:  These samples were included in the database in addition to all the regular samples processed for this date.  It is unclear why they were included, but they appear to be duplicate samples taken from the two main creeks (Town Creek and Clambank Creek) that all the sample site creeklets arise from.  They may have been included for comparisons or baseline information. 08/24/1998, Diatoxanthin, all samples.  For these samples, the Diatoxanthin pigment was isolated and Peak Areas were recorded, but there were no Rf values reported or concentrations calculated.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager found and inserted the Rf value for these samples and then calculated the concentrations for the final database. 08/24/1998, Carotene, all samples.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager corrected erroneous data.  For these samples, the alpha and beta-carotene pigments were not isolated from each other, but were isolated from the other pigments together.  The results were improperly entered as beta-carotene results, and zeros were improperly entered for the Peak Areas and concentrations for alpha-carotene.  The Data Manager entered the pigment results under the Carotenes (alpha and beta) parameter, and filled the separate alpha and beta carotene parameters with missing data markers. 03/25/1998 Diatoxanthin, all samples.  For these samples, the Diatoxanthin pigment was isolated and Peak Areas were recorded, but there were no Rf values reported or concentrations calculated.  The 2004 Data Rescue Manager found and inserted the Rf value for these samples and then calculated the concentrations for the final database. </complete> <lineage> <method> <methtype>Field Collection Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Phytoplankton Pigment Field Collection Protocol Water samples collected for chemical analysis (Water Chemistry, Chlorophyll a, and Suspended Solids) were also used for phytoplankton pigment analysis.  The samples were taken in triplicate (A, B, and C) approximately mid-way between the daytime high and low tide stages, from the center of each creek mouth, and at a depth of 1 m below the surface, but not closer than about 0.3 m to the bottom.  Water temperatures were measured as the samples were taken (see Creek Water Chemistry data) and all samples were collected within 45 minutes.  Sample bottles were immediately placed on ice and rushed to the laboratory for processing.  Samples were collected on a weekly basis, however, not all samples were processed for pigments.  In 1997 and 1998 duplicate samples (A and B) were processed.  In 1999 only one sample (B) was used.  Water samples were processed for pigments more frequently in summer months and least frequently in winter months.  Processing frequency varied from every couple of months to every couple of weeks. </methdesc> </method> <method> <methtype>Laboratory Procedures and Protocols</methtype> <methdesc> Phytoplankton Pigment Sample processing and HPLC Analysis The water samples were filtered using a 25-millimeter glass fiber grade F (GF/F) filter, with a vacuum of 10 inches mercury or less, within a couple hours of collection.  The filter and the algae it contained were stored in a -80 degree Celsius freezer until the samples were needed.  From this freezer, each sample (filter with algae) was placed into a glass vial.  The HPLC technician added 2 milliliters of HPLC grade acetone and agitated the mixture with a vortex mixer for about 20 seconds, or until the filter broke down.  The filter and algae \"slurry\" were then placed in a -20 degree Celsius freezer overnight.  The next morning, the sample was vortexed again and then syringe filtered through a 0.2 micron pore size PTFE membrane.  The filtrate was stored at -20 degrees Celsius until it was analyzed, usually within a day or two.  Analysis was conducted using a Beckman System Gold HPLC (125 pump unit and 168 detector), initially with the Beckman Gold software and later with the 32 Karat Gold software, following the method of Van Heukelem and Thomas (2001) specific for the Agilent XDB C8 column. </methdesc> <methcite> <citeinfo> <origin>Laurie Van Heukelem</origin> <origin>Crystal S.

The Peak Area is the pigment measurement output resulting from HPLC analysis.  The Rf value is the response factor calculated from a standard, 20 is a multiplier based on the amount of sample injected, and Volume refers to the volume of original sample filtered (not the amount of extract that was analyzed).  This Process Excel spreadsheet contained each pigment's Peak Area, Rf value, and the calculated concentrations for the specified sample, as well as the, date, sample location and volume filtered.  The HPLC technician verified all data entered into the spreadsheet. 2004-2005 Data Rescue Process Description The 2004-2005 Data Rescue Manager obtained all available raw and process data files from Raphael Tymowski and Alan Lewitus (primary investigators).  Raw files were originally exported and saved in a format that is readable only with the HPLC software.  Hardcopies of the HPLC output contained within these files are maintained onsite by the HPLC technician.  In order to archive the raw data in a more usable digital format, they were exported as text files.  In a few instances, the raw files were corrupted and could not be exported as text, so the hardcopies were scanned into a .JPG format.  The original raw data files, exported text files, and those few scanned images were archived on CD and on Baruch's Rescue Server in the CREEK.PHYTOPLNKTN.RAW Archive Directory.  Hardcopies of the HPLC output remain at the Baruch Marine Field Lab and are maintained by the HPLC Technician. Two process data files, CREEK.HPLC.1997-1998 and CREEK.HPLC.1999, were maintained in Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet format by the HPLC Technician.  The 2004-2005 Data Rescue Manager obtained these two process files, rearranged the formats to make them compatible, and then combined them into a single spreadsheet called CREEK.HPLC.1997-1999.PROCESS.  Merging these spreadsheets required dealing with differences between the pigments that were analyzed and the combinations that they were analyzed in.  All pigments and pigment combinations that were analyzed throughout the database were included in the combined spreadsheet, and missing data markers (periods) were inserted for portions of the dataset were the pigments or pigment combinations were not analyzed.  The resulting Excel spreadsheet contained the sample date, sample site and replicate, volume filtered, Rf values, pigment peak areas, and pigment concentrations for all processed samples and pigments. The 2004-2005 Data Manager used the combined Process Spreadsheet to quality check the data.  All obvious errors and questionable data were discussed with the HPLC technician and corrected were possible.  Corrections to the data made by the Data Rescue Manager included determining whether blank cells represented a zero reading or missing data, calculating concentrations where they had not been previously calculated, and correcting pigment results recorded under the wrong parameter.  All corrections and questionable data were noted under the Anomalous Data portion of the Completeness Report in this document.  After completing this quality check, the Data Rescue Manager verified that all missing data were marked with a period (.) and documented completely in the Missing Data portion of the Completeness Report.  The original process data files and the process spreadsheet compiled and edited by the 2004-2005 Data Rescue Manager were archived, on CD and Baruch's Rescue Server in the CREEK.PHYTOPLNKTN.PROCESS Directory, in both MS Excel and CSV formats. Finally, the 2004-2005 Data Rescue Manager created a Final spreadsheet, called CREEK.PHYTOPLNKTN.1997-1999 for publishing purposes.  This spreadsheet contains the sample date, sample site and replicate, and pigment concentrations for all samples and pigments analyzed.  This final spreadsheet was archived in both MS Excel and CSV formats, along with this metadata document, in the CREEK.PHYTOPLNKTN.FINAL Directory on CD, Baruch's Server and Baruch's website as part of the final, published database.  Hardcopies of both the metadata document and final spreadsheet were printed for archival in the CREEK Project's Notebook, which is maintained by Baruch's Data Manager onsite at the Field Lab.  In addition to the final published database archival, all raw and process files were also archived on CD and on Baruch's Rescue Server. </procdesc> <procdate> 20050228 </procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>North Inlet Estuary, which is part of Hobcaw Barony, is located in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA</indspref> <direct> Point </direct> </spdoinfo> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover> Date = the month day and year that the sample was collected, not necessarily processed or analyzed.
