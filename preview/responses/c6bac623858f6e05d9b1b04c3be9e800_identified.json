An investigation of EPC ratings and transaction prices in England Fuerst, Franz; McAllister, Patrick; Nanda, Anupam; Wyatt, Peter This paper investigates whether energy performance ratings, as measured by mandatory Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), are reflected in the sale prices of residential properties. This is the first large-scale empirical study of this topic in England involving 333,095 dwellings sold at least twice in the period from 1995 to 2012. Applying hedonic regression and an augmented repeat sales regression, we find a positive relationship between the energy efficiency rating of a dwelling and the transaction price per square metre. The price effects of superior energy performance tend to be higher for terraced dwellings and flats compared to detached and semi-detached dwellings. The evidence is less clear-cut for rates of house price growth but remains supportive of a positive association. Overall, the results of this study suggest that energy efficiency labels have a measurable and significant impact on house prices in England.

Cremers, Martijn; Lizieri, Colin Using a holdings-based measure of active management termed the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSegment Active Share\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, the paper documents that commercial real estate portfolios that are more active \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd i.e., have segment weights which are least like those of the index \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd have outperformed. Employing proprietary IPD data for 256 U.K. real estate funds over 2002-2011, we find that funds with high Segment Active Share on average outperformed the real estate market by 1.9% per year. These funds do not seem to take increased risk and their outperformance cannot be explained by fund size alone, though on average they are smaller funds. This is the accepted manuscript.

An analytical framework is developed to ascertain when legal pluralism is problematic in the control of wrongdoing. It is demonstrated that there are three specific cases: rivalrous compliance, sanctions for wrong behaviour that are deemed to be wrongs themselves, and the uncoordinated sanctioning of common wrongs. Then there is a discussion of the consequences and some approaches that can be used to ameliorate each case that has been identified. It is hoped that this framework will be used to guide future practical and theoretical discussions on legal pluralism and its potential problems. This is the accepted manuscript.

Lees, Emma In Gold Harp v MacLeod [2014] EWCA Civ 1084, the Court of Appeal considers Schedule 4, paragraph 8 Land Registration Act 2002. It interprets this provision so as to mean that the priority between mistakenly de-registered interests and registered interests can be altered following rectification. The court can give the de-registered interest the priority which it \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwould have had\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd but for the mistake. In other words, it allows for retrospective rectification. This case note concludes that this is the correct interpretation of paragraph 8 and of the words \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfor the future\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. However, it argues that the current range of options available to the court in terms of rectification are producing uncertainty, and that a better approach may be to rely on the priority provisions in sections 28 and 29. This is the accepted manuscript. It will be embargoed until 12 months after publication by Wiley. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
