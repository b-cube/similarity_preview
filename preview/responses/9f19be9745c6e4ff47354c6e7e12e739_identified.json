The research team conducted interviews with 220 women from the sex industry (Dataset 1), 92 sex trade facilitators (Dataset 2), 30 government/law enforcement officials (Dataset 3), and 20 community-based service providers (Dataset 4).         </abstract>                 <abstract>                    The purpose of this study was to examine the nature, process, and possible causal factors related to sex trafficking activities in Tijuana and assess its implications on the United States' and Mexico's anti-trafficking efforts and policies.           </abstract>                             <abstract>                                                <p>A total of 220 interviews were conducted with women who worked in Tijuana's sex industry (Dataset 1). The interviews with prostitutes were conducted by a team of interviewers who were residents of Tijuana and all college educated. All were either already working in the social services (some in community medical clinics), or had prior experience working with women in the sex industry. The interview questions  covered the following domains of information: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) recruitment stage, (3) reasons for coming to Tijuana, (4) transportation stage, (5) arrival and settlement stage, (6) work as a prostitute, (7) income from prostitution, (8) routine and leisure activities, and (9) views on prostitution.</p> <p>Another 92 interviews were conducted with pimps or sex trade facilitators (Dataset 2). These included pimps who directly controlled women and transported them to different prostitution venues on a daily basis, transporters who shuttled women from location to location, strip club owners and managers, and escort service coordinators. The main domains of information covered in the interviews with pimps and sex trade facilitators included: (1) individual characteristics, (2) interaction and transaction patterns in the sex trade, (3) prostitution in different venues, (4) patterns in recruiting and transporting women to prostitution venues, (5) financial matters, (6) problems encountered in the sex trade and the subjects' coping mechanisms, (7) involvement in other business activities, (8) affiliation with organized crime, and (9) views on the sex trade.</p> <p>In addition to the core interviews with pimps and prostitutes, this study gathered opinions and impressions from law enforcement and other government officials about sex trafficking. A total of 30 government officials (mostly police officers) were interviewed (Dataset 3). Interviews with law enforcement authorities, judges, prosecutors, and government officials focused on their assessment of the trafficking problems in their jurisdictions, strategies for suppressing the problem, and recommendations for improvement. They were asked to: (1) describe the sex trafficking situation in Tijuana, (2) provide cases of arrests and prosecutions, (3) describe challenges and problems in current anti-trafficking efforts, and (4) recommend specific measures for improvement, particularly with regard to bilateral strategies to combat sex trafficking and the sex industry.</p> <p>A total of 20 non-government agency representatives were also interviewed for this study (Dataset 4). Interviews with social service providers, non-governmental organizations (NGO), and advocacy groups focused on the following main domains of information: (1) the assessment of the sex trafficking situation in Tijuana or the border region, (2) their current roles and functions, (3) challenges of their agency services or functions, and (4) relationships with local government authorities.</p> <p>The instruments administered to all study participants included a combination of structured questions (with fixed responses) and open-ended measures. A nominal fee was paid to both the prostitutes and the sex trade facilitators to encourage participation. No compensation was given to any public officials or representatives from the non-governmental organizations. </p>                                    </abstract>                             <abstract>                                                <p>The Prostitute Interview Data (Dataset 1) contain a total of 153 variables including demographic characteristics, recruitment stage variables, transportation stage variables, arrival and settlement stage variables, description of work as a prostitute, income from prostitution, routine and leisure activities, and views on prostitution.

The selection of Tijuana as the main data gathering site was because of its geo-political location relevant to the problem of sex trafficking.</p> <p>Recruitment procedures used in this study were not based on probability sampling, but on a combination of location-based approach sampling and referrals from the social networks of those involved in this project. Due to the restrictions imposed by the university Institutional Review Board (IRB), the recruitment of women in the sex industry was mostly conducted at a government-run health clinic where the \"sanitary control card\" is issued to registered sex workers in Tijuana. Included in the data are interviews with 220 women from Tijuana's sex industry, 92 pimps and sex trade facilitators (defined as anyone who solicited customers, arranged transactions, or otherwise enabled prostitution for a fee), 30 government and law enforcement officials, and 20 community-based service providers.</p>                                   </sampProc>                                      <collMode>face-to-face interview</collMode>                           <sources>          <dataSrc>                          Interviews with 220 women from Tijuana's sex industry (Dataset 1), 92 pimps and sex trade facilitators (Dataset 2), 30 government and law enforcement officials (Dataset 3), and 20 community-based service providers (Dataset 4).             </dataSrc>        </sources>       <weight>               None     </weight>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to   these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><list type=\"bulleted\">  <itm>Standardized missing values.</itm><itm>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</itm>  </list>  </cleanOps>              </dataColl>       <notes>                 To explore possible spillover effects from transnational sex trade activities, the study also conducted interviews on the United States side (almost all in San Diego) with law enforcement representatives, social service providers, and 72 exotic dancers in the city of San Diego. Field observations were also conducted in Tijuana and interior Mexico in states with established illegal United States-bound migration activities. While referenced in the project's report (Zhang, 2011; NCJ 234472), data from interviews conducted in the United States, data on community informants, and field observations data are not available as part of this data collection at this time.         </notes>                  <notes>                 For consistency with terminology used by the principal investigator, the term \"prostitute\" is used as much as possible in the ICPSR metadata and study documentation to refer to women who trade sexual services for money. To break the monotony, such terms as \"subjects\" or \"the women\" and occasionally \"sex worker\" are also used. The project's report (Zhang, 2011; NCJ 234472) describes the issue of proper terminology for women in the sex industry in more detail.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>                 <respRate>                                                                  Not available                               </respRate>                       <dataAppr>                 None          </dataAppr>                          </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR28301.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                                   <restrctn>                                    Access to these data is restricted.

Names and other identifying information regarding respondents, proxies, or other persons on whom the respondent or proxy provides information, are presumed to be confidential.</itm><itm><hi>research subject</hi> - A person or organization observed for purposes of research. Also called a respondent. A respondent is generally a survey respondent or informant, experimental or observational subject, focus group participant, or any other person providing information to a study or on whose behalf a proxy provides information. </itm></list><p>In addition, the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data stipulates the following conditions:</p> <p>Federal law and regulations require that research data collected by the U.S. Department of Justice or by its grantees and contractors may only be used for research or statistical purposes. The applicable laws and regulations may be found in the United States Code, 42 USC Section 3789g(a), the Code of Federal Regulations, 28 CFR 22, and 62 F.R. 35044 (June 27, 1997) (The Federal Confidentiality Order). Accordingly, any intentional identification or disclosure of a person or establishment may violate federal law as well as the assurances of confidentiality given to the providers of the information. Therefore, users of data collected by or with the support from the U.S. Department of Justice and distributed by NACJD or other ICPSR archives must agree to abide by these regulations and understand that ICPSR may report any potential violation to the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>                                    <p>AVAILABLE.
