The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors. It also covers Northern Ireland and incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets. LCM2007 was classified using a nomenclature corresponding to Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompasses the entire range of UK habitats. In addition, it recorded further detail where possible, incorporating land cover classes sought by other users. LCM2007 is produced in both vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.  This dataset consists of the 1km raster, percentage Aggregate Class.  Great Britain only.

Measurements include species counts in the following areas: weed seedbank, vegetation in the crop, field edge vegetation, invertebrates. The data were collected as part of the Farm Scale Evaluations (FSEs), a four-year programme of research by independent researchers aimed at studying the effect that the management practices associated with Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (GMHT) crops might have on farmland wildlife, when compared with weed control used with non-GM crops. Data were collected by a consortium of: the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, ITE (now the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, CEH), the Institute of Arable Crop Research (now Rothamstead Research, IACR) and the Scottish Crop Research Institute, SCRI (now the James Hutton Institute, JHI). Data were collected for four crops overall (Beet, Maize, Spring-sown Oilseed Rape and Winter-sown oilseed Rape).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>agro-ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>arable farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>crops</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>environmental impact</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biodiversity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>weeds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>arable</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>seedbank</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>invertebrates</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>functional groups</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>genetically modified herbicide-tolerant crops</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>sugar beet</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>maize</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>trophic interactions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project C01732</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-02-27T10:10:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1a91c7d1-ec44-4858-9af2-98d80f169bbd\">     <title>Observations of Fukushima fallout in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1a91c7d1-ec44-4858-9af2-98d80f169bbd</link>     <description>Following the Fukushima accident in March 2011, grass samples were collected from 42 sites around Great Britain during April 2011. Iodine-131 was measurable in grass samples across the country with activity concentrations ranging from 10 to 55 Bq per kg dry matter. Concentrations were similar to those reported in other European countries.  Rainwater and some foodstuffs were also analysed from a limited number of sites. Of these, I-131 was only detectable in sheep's milk (c. 2 Bq/kg). Caesium-134, which can be attributed to releases from the Fukushima reactors, was detectable in six of the grass samples (4-8 Bq/kg dry matter); 137Cs was detected in a larger number of grass samples although previous release sources (atmospheric weapons test and the 1986 Chernobyl and 1957 Windscale accidents) are likely to have contributed to this.  All data and information for this sampling are available from this record. The data result from collaboration between CEH and the University of Stirling.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>March-May 2011</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Fukushima</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Japan</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC04023</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>foodstuffs</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>I-131</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>caesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-04T15:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
