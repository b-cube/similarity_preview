Memory is thought to be encoded as long lasting changes in the strength of signalling between synapses formed by excitable cells in the brain. By gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory acquisition, we aim to improve our ability to enhance the brains capacity to learn and develop strategies for repair following injury or neurodegenerative diseases that affect memory, such as Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease.</p> <p>One of the models of synaptic plasticity that we study is the long-term depression of transmission at the synapse formed between cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje cells. So called LTD may provide the mechanism for learning in the motor system, allowing acquisition of skilled movements during development and practice. Over the last few years, we have examined the contributions of numerous receptors and second messengers to LTD and other forms of plasticity at this synapse, including calcium, nitric oxide, cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and arachidonic acid.</p> <p>We are currently working towards developing methods of visualising transmitter release and receptor trafficking using fluorescent protein based sensors. Our long term goal is to to be able to visualise synapses \"learning\".&nbsp;We have an interest in developing high speed and high resolution confocal and multiphoton microscopes to allow us to examine the activity of cells within complex neuronal circuits.

Although this was a ground breaking result, it was later showed that the atmospheric conditions used in this experiment did not correspond to the ones of our primitive planet.</p> <p>As the Earth was heavily bombarded by comets, asteroids, meteorites and interplanetary dust particle (IDPs) 4.6 to 3.8 million years ago, the exogenous delivery of organic compounds is an alternative. In fact, carbonaceous meteorites have a rich organic inventory, and may have provided the first building blocks of life to the primitive Earth. As future space missions will investigate the possibility of past and/or present extra-terrestrial life, it is important to determine how life may have originated in other places of our solar system, and how to detect possible bio-signatures.</p> <p>This talk will discuss how the study of meteorites, asteroids, comets and Mars soil analogues is used to investigate the origin of life on Earth and how to detect any possible signatures of extra-terrestrial life in our solar system.</p> <p><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/public-events/research-lectures/zita-martins/research-lecture-zita-martins-flyer\">Flyer for this event</a></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <h2 class=\" \">Dr Zita Martins<img style=\"float: right; \" alt=\"Zita Martins_profile\" class=\"image-inline\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/assets/ZitaMartins.jpg/@@images/292810ad-3c84-441c-a64c-ab01cecf99ef.jpeg\" title=\"Zita Martins_profile\" /></h2> <p>Dr Zita Martins is a Royal Society University\\ufffd\\ufffdResearch Fellow at Imperial College London.

Plants with mutated versions of DAZ1 and DAZ2 produce pollen grains with a single sperm that is unable to fertilize.</p> <p>The research shows that DAZ1 and DAZ2 are controlled by the protein DUO1 that acts as a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmaster switch\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd - so that DUO1 and the DAZ1/DAZ2 genes work in tandem to control a gene network that ensures a pair of fertile sperm is made inside each pollen grain.</p> <p>Interestingly, DAZ1 and DAZ2 perform their role by cooperating with a well-known \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrepressor\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd protein called TOPLESS that acts as a brake on unwanted gene activity that would otherwise halt sperm and seed production. Although TOPLESS has many roles in plants it has not previously been linked sperm production.</p> <p>This new knowledge has the potential to be applied in the development of new plant breeding techniques to prevent the unwanted passing of genes \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhorizontal gene transfer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd - between crops or from crops to wild species and could generate new ways of monitoring the effects of, environmental stresses on the reproductive process.

Which is fine for global audiences, but if a film with a conservation message is aimed at a community, wouldn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt it be better if it was made by someone in that community?</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This is the premise behind <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://conservationfilms.org/community/\">Local action for global impact - community-based biodiversity conservation films</a>, a Leicester-led project which finished last month but will continue in a new form. To date, more than 80 young people in East Africa have been trained up in filming and editing techniques and between them they have produced about 200 short films on environmental themes.</p> <p>Dr David Harper from our <a class=\"internal-link\" title=\"Biology\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\">Department of Biology</a> has been instrumental in the project which was established in 2008 with funding from the UK Government\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://darwin.defra.gov.uk/\">Darwin Initiative</a>. The initial idea came from <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.brockinitiative.org/\">Richard Brock</a>, who before becoming a freelancer, produced the first two of David Attenborough\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds amazing series <em>Life on Earth</em> and <em>The Living Planet</em>.</p> <p>After a decade of freelance film-making, Richard retired and resolved to give something back to the communities which he had visited on his travels. David Harper&nbsp;had known Richard since they met in Kenya in 2002 and together they applied for a grant with the aim of bringing film-making expertise and technology to areas which are \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbiodiversity rich but resources poor.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Aspiring film-makers are identified through existing ecological organisations and then given a few weeks\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd intensive training in all aspects of the process, both technical and logistical. They learn how to use a Panasonic or Canon digital video camera and how to edit on an Apple laptop in Final Cut Pro. They also learn sound recording techniques, good interviewing techniques and all the other skills required to create a short film which is good enough to show to an audience.</p> <p>The resulting films - usually in English but occasionally in Swahili, and subtitled in either \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd are shown by local educational officers from the Government, NGOs and charities and have also been shown on Kenyan and Tanzanian TV. A ten-minute film that looks at a situation from the same point of view as its audience will always have much more effect than an hour of David Attenborough-narrated footage, however magnificently shot.</p> <p>There is no point in explaining the marvels of flamingos or monkeys to people who see such animals every day so the subjects covered are those which matter to local communities. The perils of erosion through over-grazing, for example, or the ecological benefits of bee-keeping.</p> <p>Although the funding ended in October 2010, the project continues as a not-for-profit company with the same name. Already it has become to some extent self-perpetuating as nearly half the trainees have actually been trained up by their peers.</p> <p>The only problem, David Harper notes, is that some of the equipment which was still under guarantee has been returned to the UK for repair. One of the perils of shooting in Africa: on removing the casing it was discovered that the laptops were full of insects and sand...</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conservation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Film</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2010-11-02T13:58:59Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
