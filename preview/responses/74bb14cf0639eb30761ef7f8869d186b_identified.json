Here the river is 17-20m wide and up to 4m deep with a predominantly silty substrate. The surrounding catchment is underlain by Quaternary deposits of Norwich crag with chalk at depth and superficial glacial till and outwash deposits. Land use in the catchment is predominantly agricultural, especially arable. Due to problems with eutrophication of the Broads, there has been a programme of phosphate stripping at the major sewage treatment works on the Bure since 1986.</p> <p>Invertebrate monitoring takes place downstream of the Mill where the river is divided into two channels and there is a riffle area of gravel, pebbles and sand and areas of emergent plants (Sparganium erectum, Glyceria sp.) at the margins. Macrophyte and diatom monitoring takes place between 0.5-1km upstream of the Mill at a semi-natural stretch of river away from man-made structures. The substrate is predominantly silty. There is a diverse submerged plant community, including a good cover of Elodea nuttallii.

Rising in the Antrim hills at 480 m OD, for must of its length the river  flows through a fertile valley devoted to grassland-based agriculture  with limited arable cropping. The underlying geology is basalt and the  water is slightly alkaline with magnesium making an unusually large  contribution to total hardness. The river supports indigenous stocks of  Atlantic salmon and brown trout, but it is the salmon population which  is of the greater interest. Bush salmon have been the focus of long term  studies on salmon ecology and on the techniques suitable for managing  salmon populations.   A fish-trap on the river at Bushmills, some 3.5 km  from the sea, enables ascending adult fish and returning juvenile  salmon smolts to intercepted, counted and sampled. This work has been  ongoing since 1973 and is accompanied by annual assessments of fry  survival in the main spawning areas of the river. In addition to the  river being part of the UK ECN network, the river is an International  Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) index river which  integrates the results with other salmon research programmes in the  North-East Atlantic.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-03T13:30:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/coln\">     <title>Coln</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/coln</link>     <description>The Coln ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The River Coln rises at an altitude of about 200m AOD near Sevenhampton in Gloucestershire and flows from the limestone Cotswold Hills in a south-easterly direction to Lechlade where it joins the River Thames at an altitude of about 75m AOD. There are no major tributaries. The sampling site is located in Lechlade about 70m above the confluence with the Thames.The source of the river is in the Inferior Oolite aquifer in which it flows for the first few kilometers, but most of the river runs on the Great Oolite aquifer. Both of the limestone aquifers are sources for water abstration; a total of 55 ml per day are consented from the catchment. The river crosses Oxford Clay before running into the Thames. The catchment is mostly rural, with farming the main industry. The upper catchment is mainly grazing land, and there are large areas of deciduous woodland in the south-west. The upper two-thirds of the catchment is within the Cotswold Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), and around Fairford the river has been designated as a Nitrate-sensitive area.</p> <p>There are no large conurbations on the upper catchment, although Cheltenham, from where surface water drains into the limestone above the river's source, has a population of over 100,000. The Coln catchment supports a population of around 9,000. The main sewage inputs to the river are from works at Andoversford, Bibury and Fairford. Bibury Tout farm is the largest discharge into the river, although most of this is 'on-line' through fish-ponds. The river has been subject to various enhancement schemes to improve ecology and fisheries. Water quality was recorded as 'good to fair' in the 1995 General Quality Assessment survey; the classification varies throughout the river, due to the effects of both discharges and low flows.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-04T13:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/coquet\">     <title>Coquet</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/coquet</link>     <description>The Coquet ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The River Coquet rises at Coquet Head on the Scottish border and  flows generally eastward, draining the southern flanks of the Cheviot  Hills, finally discharging to the North Sea at Amble.

The ECN sampling site (National Grid ref: 4921 3289) is situated in the lower reaches of the Cringle, downstream of the impounded section, where the Brook is 5-7metres wide and 10-50 centimetres deep, flowing over a sand/gravel substratum with a small content of cobbles and infrequent sections of limestone pavement. This stretch is surrounded by a private golf-course, the river channel and adjacent river corridor being generally unmanaged, with extensive bankside tree-cover and no engineering works (e.g. weed-cutting, dredging or reprofiling) undertaken. The upstream impoundment maintains a year-round flow of little variation, and also buffers the downstream section against mild enrichment by a village sewage treatment works at Skillington and a sewage pumping station at Stoke Rochford.

Its main tributaries are the Gibbs Brook, Eden Vale Stream, Eden Brook, and the Felbridge Water. The Eden catchment is largely rural and agricultural although much of the dairy farming which predominated has now declined and has been replaced by mixed farming.

The river receives treated sewage effluent from two Southern Water Services Limited Sewage Treatment Works (STW), serving Edenbridge and Oxted repectively; the stretches receiving these effluents are both subject to EC Urban Water Treatment \"Sensitive Waters\" investigations. There are other much smaller private sewage treatment works throughout the catchment. The river and its tributaries support coarse fisheries. Average flows at Penshurst range from 3.909 cumecs in January to 0.485 cumecs in July.</p> <h3>See also:</h3> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/riverlevels/136485.aspx?stationId=1084\">River levels on the Eden tributary Medway at Penshurt</a> (Environment Agency)</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-04T13:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/esk\">     <title>Esk</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/esk</link>     <description>The Esk ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The River Esk rises on the uplands of the North York Moors National  Park and is the only major river in the county of Yorkshire that drains  directly into the North Sea. The catchment is sparsely populated without  the pressures of industrialisation and urbanisation affecting other  rivers in the Region. Open moorland characterises much of the catchment  and is an important habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. Within the  Esk valley there are six SSSI's, two of which extend south and cross the  boundary of the Derwent catchment.</p> <p>The source of the Esk is  upstream of Westerdale, where a series of becks known as the Esklets  merge to form the River Esk. Many of these moorland streams are affected  by natural \"flushes\" of acidity, as well as iron run-off from natural  ironstone strata and old mineral workings, making some of these becks an  ochreous-orange colour after periods of rainfall. The combination of  the two factors restrict the invertebrate fauna in these head-streams.  The majority of the River Esk downstream of the Esklets has very good  water quality, with the diverse invertebrate fauna dominated by  mayflies, stoneflies, caddis-flies and other pollution sensitive groups.  This good water quality is also very important in sustaining other  species such as salmon, sea trout, dippers and otters.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-03T14:09:46Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/ewe\">     <title>Ewe</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/ewe</link>     <description>The Ewe ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The River Ewe, in Wester Ross, is a short stretch of river running  north-westwards out of Loch Maree into the sea at Poolewe. The large  upland catchment (441.1 km<sup>2</sup>), which includes Loch Maree and  Loch Ewe, is mainly peaty moorland predominantly managed for deer  grazing, with some limited hill sheep farming and negligible arable  farming. It is well-known for its populations of feral goats. Land rises  to over 900m on a number of mountains incuding Slioch and Ben Eighe.  Average annual catchment rainfall is 2272mm and long-term average flow  at the Poolewe gauging station is 29.64 cumecs.</p> <p>The Ewe catchment  is as close to pristine as is possible on the Scottish mainland and,  unusually for this part of Scotland, it has no discharges from intensive  fish farming. Parts of the catchment are of national scenic and  conservation interest and have been designated as a National Nature  Reserve (NNR) and National Scenic Area (NSA).  There are large areas of  deer forest and protected (by SSSI status) woodlands of Scots pine and  native oak. There is one small-scale hydro-electric scheme on a  tributary flowing into Loch Maree; two further small schemes are  proposed. The River Ewe and Loch Maree are important for their salmonid  fisheries, but the decline of the trout fishery in Loch Maree is a well  recorded phenomenon which is under investigation by the Scottish Office  Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD); it is  regarded as indicative of such declines generally on the west coast of  Scotland.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-03T12:43:47Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/exe\">     <title>Exe</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/rivers/exe</link>     <description>The Exe ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>This site at Thorverton weir on the River Exe drains the Exmoor National Park and is situated above the City of Exeter and the more industrialised sub-catchment of the River Culm. Most of the catchment is populated by isolated farmsteads, hamlets, villages and small towns. The only major urban area upstream of this site is Tiverton. The River Exe rises at a level of 450 m AOD in the wet moorland of Exmoor, then passes through steep-sided valleys with extensive broad-leaved woodland. Further east, tributaries run off the Brendon Hills with the River Haddeo drained to form the major water resource of Wimbleball Reservoir. Further south of these tributaries down towards Tiverton the floodplain opens out and rolling farmland replaces woodland. The farmland in the catchment of Thorverton weir includes sheep, cattle and dairy farming. All stretches of river above Thorverton weir, except the Riverton canal, fit into the Environment Agency's River Objective classes 1 &amp; 2 which describe water of very good, or good quality suitable for all fish species. The majority of the Thorverton weir catchment fits into the Environment Agency's Biological Classification class A. The average rainfall for the Exe catchment as a whole 1097 mm, with a maximum of 2018 mm on Exmoor. Analysis of the flow record at Thorverton shows a mean daily flow of 15.887 cumecs with a Q95 that is 12% of the mean daily flow which indicates a relatively 'flashy' flow regime compared to the rest of England.</p> <h3>See also:</h3> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/riverlevels/120726.aspx?stationId=3260\">River levels on the Exe at Thorverton</a> (Environment Agency)</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-04T14:15:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>      </rdf:RDF> ",
