The dataset runs from the breeding season in 1993 to the end of the breeding season in 2014. The first egg dates are presented as the number days from the start date which was set as the 1st April each year. Because the breeding of greats tits and blue tits is influenced in large part by ambient temperature and the phenology of their main prey, the data were collected as a measure spring phenology. These data comprise part of a larger long-term study of the influence of habitat (extent, structure and composition) and landscape factors on abundance, distribution and breeding success of woodland birds in English lowland deciduous woodland.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cambridgeshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monks Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brampton Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wennington Wood</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>blue tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>great tits</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Parus major</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cyanistes caeruleus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>breeding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deciduous woodland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable land management (en)</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-10T12:37:18Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b0c4358-2bf3-4924-aa8f-793d468b92be\">     <title>High-resolution global topographic index values</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/6b0c4358-2bf3-4924-aa8f-793d468b92be</link>     <description>The topographic index is a hydrological quantity describing the propensity of the soil at landscape points to become saturated with water as a result of topographic position (i.e. not accounting for other factors such as climate that also affect soil moisture but are accounted for separately). Modern land surface models require a characterisation of the land surface hydrological regime and this parameter allows the use of the TOPMODEL hydrological model to achieve this .This Geographic Information System layer is intended for use as topographic ancillary files for the TOPMODEL routing model option within the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model. The topographic index variable here is directly comparable to the compound topographic index available from United States Geological Survey's Hydro1K at 30 sec resolution.

The series of LCM2007 products includes vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-15T14:54:22Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5d324260-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (1km percentage aggregate class, GB) Web Map Service v1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5d324260-22d9-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>This is a web map service (WMS) for the Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007), percentage cover at 1km for aggregate classes. Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom. The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors.  It also covers Northern Ireland and incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets. LCM2007 was classified using a hierarchical nomenclature corresponding to Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) Broad Habitats, which encompasses the entire range of UK habitats. In addition, it recorded further detail where possible , incorporating land cover classes sought by other users. LCM2007 is produced in both vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.  This WMS is for Great Britain only.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-15T13:40:21Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/987544e0-22d8-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (25m raster, GB) web map service V1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/987544e0-22d8-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66</link>     <description>This view service shows the 25m resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Great Britain.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from up to 591 1km squares and scaling up to a national level. The data are summarized as percentage increase or decrease in habitat area per Land Class (areas of similar environmental characteristics) and are in a vector format. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB and using the 'ITE Land Classification' as a method of stratification. The data were collected as part of Countryside Survey, a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978 by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares. In addition to habitat areas, vegetation species data, soil data, linear habitat data, and freshwater habitat data are also gathered by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Broad Habitats</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Natural Capital</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T11:26:03Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1b977181-a3bf-4535-b38e-32509001f7aa\">     <title>Soil pH at Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve 1961</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/1b977181-a3bf-4535-b38e-32509001f7aa</link>     <description>The dataset consists of pH values from soil samples taken in Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve in 1961.

The strata were created from the multivariate analysis of 75 environmental variables, including climatic data, topographic data, human geographical features and geology data.  The Land Classification has provided a stratification for successive ecological surveys (the Countryside Survey of Great Britain), the results of which have characterised the classes in terms of botanical, zoological and landscape features.  Additionally, the Land Classification can be used to stratify a wide range of ecological and biogeographical surveys to improve the efficiency of collection, analysis and presentation of information derived from a sample.  There are three versions of the Classification available. 1. The 1990 version containing 32 classes, which was the first to classify all 240,000km squares in Great Britain (building on an earlier 1978 version based on a sample of squares only).  2. A 1998 version, when the Land Classification was adjusted to 40 classes as a consequence of the need to provide National Estimates (from Countryside Survey 2000) for habitats for Scotland in addition to GB as a whole. 3. In 2007, the Land Classification was adjusted once again, to 45 classes, as a consequence of the need to provide Wales-only estimates in addition to those for Scotland and GB as a whole (from Countryside Survey 2007).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Bio-geographical regions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land classification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ITE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Institute of Terrestrial Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-05T13:34:37Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/362bff26-d2ca-4700-b1f0-22072f4bc0cc\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1984  mapped estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/362bff26-d2ca-4700-b1f0-22072f4bc0cc</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1984 in a vector format. The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from 384 1km squares surveyed for the Countryside Survey long term monitoring project, then scaling up to a national level. The data are presented as mean lengths per 1km square for 7 different feature categories within 45 different land class types, based on the ITE Land Classification. The Countryside Survey is a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside, carried out by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.  The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB.

The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time. In addition to linear features, habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Habitats and biotopes</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hedges</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>walls</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fences</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>banks</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass strips</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>tree lines</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Monitoring &amp; Observing Systems</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-04T14:14:07Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
