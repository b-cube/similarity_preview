ROV surveys were conducted in the mid and lower mesophotic zone of the sanctuary (17-150 m) on both the East Bank and the West Bank. The FGBNMS represents the northernmost tropical western Atlantic coral reef on the continental shelf and support the most highly developed offshore hard bank community in the region. The complexity of habitats supports a diverse assemblage of organisms including approximately 250 species of fish, 23 species of coral, and 80 species of algae in addition to large sponge communities. Understanding and monitoring these resources is critical to both sanctuary inventory and management activities. During the course of the sanctuary's management plan review process, the impact of fishing was identified as a priority issue, and the concept of a research only area was suggested. The purpose of this project is to provide baseline data for all benthic habitats and coral communities.</abstract>    <purpose>1) To design appropriate sampling and monitoring strategies for benthic community sampling, as well as data collection,  2) To build a baseline dataset on coral communities and benthic habitats, 3) Ground-truthing and collection of underwater imagery and video to improve existing map products, and 4) To analyze the information gathered to help guide sanctuary resource management decisions.</purpose>    <supplinf>This work is being conducted in collaboration with the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS), Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR), NOAA\\ufffd\\ufffds Center for Coastal Environment and Health and Biomolecular Research (CCEHBR), NOAA\\ufffd\\ufffds Cooperative Institute for Ocean Exploration, Research and Technology (CIOERT).</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>201005</begdate>      <enddate>201208</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>Ground Condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>as needed</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-93.87</westbc>     <eastbc>-93.57</eastbc>     <northbc>27.99</northbc>     <southbc>27.82</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>Numeric Data Sets &gt; Biology</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef Monitoring and Assessment</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Coral biodiversity</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Coral Reefs</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Coral Reefs &gt; Coral Reef Ecology &gt; BioDiversity</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Coral Reefs &gt; Coral Reef Ecology &gt; Coral Cover</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Coral Reefs &gt; Coral Reef Ecology &gt; Habitats</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Coral Reefs &gt; Coral Reef Ecology &gt; Hard Coral Cover</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Deep-water corals &gt; Antipatharia (Black and Thorny Corals)</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Aquatic Habitat &gt; Reef Habitat</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Aquatic Habitat &gt; Reef Habitat &gt; Description</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef Monitoring and Assessment &gt; Benthos Analysis</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef Monitoring and Assessment &gt; Photographic Analysis</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>biota</themekey>     <themekey>002</themekey>     <themekey>environment</themekey>     <themekey>007</themekey>     <themekey>oceans</themekey>     <themekey>014</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CRCP Project</themekt>     <themekey>F058 Baseline assessment of fish and benthic communities of the Flower Garden Banks</themekey>     <themekey>180</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt>     <placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Atlantic Ocean &gt; Gulf of Mexico &gt; Flower Garden Banks &gt; East Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0001)</placekey>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Texas &gt; East Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0001)</placekey>     <placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Atlantic Ocean &gt; Gulf of Mexico &gt; Flower Garden Banks &gt; West Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0002)</placekey>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Texas &gt; West Flower Garden Banks (27N093W0002)</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>Please reference NOAA/NCCOS/CCMA/Biogeography Branch when utilizing these data in a report or peer reviewed publication.

Sites were selected using a stratified random design in ArcMap\\ufffd\\ufffds GIS sampling design tool across  five habitats and two banks (East and West Bank; Algal nodule, Coralline algal reef, Coral reef cap, Deep reef, and Soft bottom).</complete>   <lineage>    <procstep>     <procdesc> A stratified random design was employed with a 40,000 m2 sampling frame structure. Each frame was classified using the benthic habitat map biological zones. Each year (2010, 2011, 2012) site allocation was intended to be equitably distributed. Site selection was conducted with an ArcMap GIS sampling design tool. The survey design used a stratified random approach with five habitat types (algal nodule, coral reef cap, coralline algae reef, deep reef, and soft bottom) and the two banks, East Bank (EB) and West Bank (WB). In the field and prior to ROV deployment, a select cluster of sites was chosen and conditions defined as to how the ROV will travel (e.g., under its own control or towed by the surface vessel). Under ideal conditions and when the ROV operator had good control of the ROV, sampling commenced as close as possible to the centroid of each sampling point, or, if conditions hindered ROV handling, sampling began within the 200 m2 grid cell. Transect speed was \\ufffd\\ufffd knot and followed the target habitat type for 100 m. In addition to high resolution still photos, tracking and depth information was also collected to provide real-time estimates of ROV depth and position on the seafloor. Benthic community information was collected along each transect using a digital still camera positioned underneath the ROV and facing the seafloor. Still photos of the seafloor were taken by the ROV every 30 seconds with the ROV positioned approximately 1 m from the bottom. Photos were scaled using ROV mounted lasers and images were analyzed in CPCe. Fifty points were randomly transposed over each image and the benthic type under the point was recorded. Generally, bare soft bottom, bare hard bottom, and biota were identified. Within biota, cnidarians in the Class Alcyonacea and in the Order Antipatharia were identified to the family level. Cnidarians in the Order Scleractinia were identified to species level. Algae were identified to Phylum, and sponges were identified to Class. When the area under a point could not be identified, a label of \\ufffd\\ufffdunidentifiable\\ufffd\\ufffd was used. All fish, mollusk, echinoderm, bacterial mat, and \\ufffd\\ufffdunidentifiable\\ufffd\\ufffd points were omitted from the family and species level analyses. The density of each coral taxon was quantified by counting individuals within all images for each transect.</procdesc>     <procdate>201405</procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <geograph>     <latres>0.00001</latres>     <longres>0.00001</longres>     <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>    </geograph>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover>We supply benthic habitat percentage cover and coral community desnity information at the lowest possible taxonomic level across all habitats within the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (FGBNMS).
