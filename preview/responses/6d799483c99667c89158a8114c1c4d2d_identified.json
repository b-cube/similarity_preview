This song shows that Papwojo Youth have increased in number, and they need more dancing mates, so the composer starts the song by asking permission from the youth leader to allow him to compose this song, because he knew that the song will motivate the youth.

It has been proposed that learning in a larger community results in a learner receiving their input from a greater number of speakers.

Variation occurs non-randomly across the genome, and mechanisms for this remain to be defined. Here we report that the 5' ends of Okazaki fragments have significantly increased levels of nucleotide substitution, indicating a replicative origin for such mutations. Using a novel method, emRiboSeq, we map the genome-wide contribution of polymerases, and show that despite Okazaki fragment processing, DNA synthesized by error-prone polymerase-alpha (Pol-alpha) is retained in vivo, comprising ~1.5% of the mature genome. We propose that DNA-binding proteins that rapidly re-associate post-replication act as partial barriers to Pol-delta-mediated displacement of Pol-alpha-synthesized DNA, resulting in incorporation of such Pol-alpha tracts and increased mutation rates at specific sites. We observe a mutational cost to chromatin and regulatory protein binding, resulting in mutation hotspots at regulatory elements, with signatures of this process detectable in both yeast and humans. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-23T13:45:33Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Quasi-geostrophic double gyre force function data</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/695\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/695</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:33Z</updated> <published>2015-01-22T17:09:36Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Quasi-geostrophic double gyre force function data </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-22T17:09:36Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>ARCHER CSE Performance Data and Service Report: Q1 2014</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/692\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/692</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:34Z</updated> <published>2015-01-12T13:52:52Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">ARCHER CSE Performance Data and Service Report: Q1 2014 Data from SAFE (https://www.archer.ac.uk/safe) and Quarter 1 2014 Service Report from ARCHER Computational Science and Engineering Service.

The composer says: Now that he is dead, nobody in Nyibody will read any book/letter sent to the chief, or to anybody in the village. Abinykwec son of Ayoker was an evangelist and taught in village school. He was humble and a man of vision. The song mixes Christian and traditional beliefs, and this is very unusual; the song calls Shilluk land as: land of Nyikango and land of God Almighty. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-05T15:41:12Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>AmaliaAyulDeng_songTheBuffaloOfTakamol</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/682\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/682</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:34Z</updated> <published>2015-01-05T15:35:33Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">AmaliaAyulDeng_songTheBuffaloOfTakamol The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Shilluk people love one another and are united wherever they are found. During the war that started in 1983, many people left their homes and went to live in northern Sudan. Women formed their social groups and each group chose a name. The women of Takamol Haj Yousif called themselves \\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffdg/Buffalo. This song was the first for the women of Takamol. It was composed for the purpose of going to beg for a cow from Otwongo Jwaj in Takamol in 1992. The women needed a bull for their first celebration. They went to Otwongo house and spent the night, singing and dancing.

Marching songs are about the courage and strength of a village or a group.  They are warriors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd songs that are sung when people are marching for war, or going to fight a fierce animal like a lion, elephant or leopard. People had no guns, so when an animal killed a cow, people start a war call, and everybody runs there with his shield and spears. Men from nearby villages come running. When all the people arrive, they divide themselves into smaller groups. And go to attack the animal that will be hiding in the grass. This Pakang Marching Song is about a lion that ate a cow near the village and then went away into the Forest of Abayo. Then Pakang and Obay villages decided to follow the lion. They followed its foot-prints in the ashes of the burnt grass. When they found it in Abayo Forest, the fighting began; the lion wounded many people from the two villages, but they killed it.  Pakang and its neighbour Obay, were enemies, but they went together to fight with the lion. So, the composer called the two villages \"\\ufffd\\ufffdgag\" crow that ate the lion. And nobody will separate them after that war with the lion. True, Pakang and Obay remained friends since that time; 1917 which was the first year of King Gwang in power. </summary> <dc:date>2014-12-18T17:11:41Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Four cover designs for the EAR 33rd Edition 2013</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/677\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/677</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:34Z</updated> <published>2014-12-11T10:49:55Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Four cover designs for the EAR 33rd Edition 2013 Cover design tests for the 33rd Edition of the Edinburgh Architecture Research journal.

However, selection for disfavoured CPs leads to unintended increases in CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies that also attenuate replication. We designed and phenotypically characterised mutants of the picornavirus, echovirus 7, in which these parameters were independently varied to determine which most influenced virus replication. CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies primarily influenced virus replication ability while no fitness differences were observed between mutants with different CP usage where dinucleotide frequencies were kept constant. Contrastingly, translation efficiency was unaffected by either CP usage or dinucleotide frequencies. This mechanistic insight is critical for future rational design of live virus vaccines and their safety evaluation; attenuation is mediated through enhanced innate immune responses to viruses with elevated CpG/UpA dinucleotide frequencies rather the viruses themselves being intrinsically defective. </summary> <dc:date>2014-11-19T10:13:27Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>LLEAPP 2013 performance video 16</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/670\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/670</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:33Z</updated> <published>2014-11-18T17:59:58Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">LLEAPP 2013 performance video 16 This is a video recording from the performance at the end of LLEAPP 2013 workshop held from 16-19 April 2013 at the University of Edinburgh.
