First a relative relief grid was derived from the 450 meter DEM using a focalrange function with a circular NAW of 5 cells. A 5 cell NAW was used because it was the best compromise for retaining detail in the spatial extent of the four basic landforms, while still generalizing the data enough to reduce the natural spatial complexity (salt and pepper) of the data. The resultant grid was then reclassified into 4 classes: 0 - 25 meters (plains), 25 - 50 meters (rolling plains), 50 - 300 meters (hills) and over 300 meters (mountains). Using relative relief ensured that flat upland areas, such as high elevation mountain valleys would be correctly attributed as flat plains, instead of mountains, in the landform grid. The cut-offs for the relative relief classes were based on a visual examination of the data against other maps with distinct occurrences of plains, rolling plains, hills and mountains. A macro slope grid was then derived from the 450 meter DEM using the percent slope function. The resultant grid was reclassified into two classes: &lt; 8% slope (flat) and &gt;8% slope (not-flat), and then generalized using a focalmajority function with a square NAW of 5 cells. The cut-off of 8% for the macro slope grid was based on a visual examination of the data against the intersection of mountain areas known to rise steeply from flat plains. 4% is more commonly used as the cut-off between flat and non-flat slopes, but percent slope data derived from a 450 meter DEM has lower slope values across a landscape, compared to percent slope derived from a 90 meter DEM, and therefore 8% is more representative of flat/not-flat slopes. The reclassified relative relief grid and reclassified macro slope grid were then combined using the map calculator in Arcview and the four basic landform classes were identified. In the end, the slope grid did not contribute to identifying landforms in this project because of the relatively coarse resolution of the DEM data (450 meters) and the small number of basic landform classes derived. The Hammond, Dikau, Brabyn and True studies identified many more landforms (e.g. nearly flat plains, rolling and irregular plains, plains with high hills, tablelands with moderate relief, tablelands with high relief, hills, high hills, low mountains, high mountains, etc.) and slope was essential for correctly identifying these more detailed types of landforms. Future projects that use finer resolution DEM data and/or develop more than four basic landform classes should include slope data in the analysis. Plateaus, identified as flattish, upland areas, were identified from a combination of data sources. A flat uplands grid was derived from the 450 meter DEM based on the methodology described in Dikau (1993) and Brabyn's (1998) studies (where an upland pixel was identified as the maximum elevation within the NAW minus the true elevation of the central pixel of the NAW which was less than half the value of the relative relief within the NAW). Flat uplands were identified as pixels above 400 meters true relief, upland from adjacent pixels, with &lt;8% slope (flat). But plateaus could not be consistently modeled from this flat uplands grid because of the variability in the elevation of plateaus across the study area. In Central Brazil, many plateaus are cuestas with elevations rising from 300 up to 900 meters true relief, while in the Guyanan Highlands most of the plateaus (tepuis) occur over 500 meters true relief and some as high as 1400 meters. In addition, the modeled flat uplands grid could not identify the complete extent of these plateaus because very few plateaus are perfectly flat, elevation varies slightly across most plateaus, but in a DEM only the individual pixels with the highest local elevation are considered uplands, and only those that also occur on flat slopes are considered flat uplands. Since well-known plateau areas and visible plateaus could not be entirely modeled from the DEM, but could clearly be seen in the hillshade grid and flat uplands grid, they were on-screen digitized using these two grids as visual references. Since only clearly visible or known plateaus were on-screen digitized, plateaus are likely under-represented in the study area. During attribution of the gridcodes to NatureServe's ecological systems in Central Brazil, a different method for modeling flat plateaus was identified. Polygons with true elevations over 500 meters that occurred on plains or rolling plains landforms clearly represented plateaus (i.e. polygons coded as plains or rolling plains on elevations 500 - 1000 meters or 1000 - 2000 meters). This method could not identify additional plateaus in the Guyanan Highlands because plateaus in this area are not as uniformly flat as in Central Brazil, and are more often represented as hills or mountains in the basic landform grid rather than plains or rolling plains. Plateaus, as defined above, did not occur in the SSA and therefore no plateaus were modeled in this part of the study area. A type of rolling plain upland did occur throughout Patagonia and was readily identified using the landform and elevation data. In the ESA, valleys (river valleys, Andes mountain river valleys and Andes mountain plateaus/valleys) were identified from a combination of data sources. Bernhard Lehner from WWF provided a draft version of a South America modeled hydrology stream network (filename: sa_wwfhydro_s). Each stream segment was attributed with an \"upcell\" value reflecting the number of 450 meter cells occurring upstream. River valleys, represented as 450 meters wide (1 pixel), were derived by selecting WWF's modeled hydrology with upcell values &gt; 20,000, which occurred in areas of predominately hill, mountain (excluding the Andes mountains) or plateau landforms. The landform grid was first generalized using a Focalmajority filter to remove small occurrences of plains and rolling plains within hill, mountain and plateau landforms. Andes mountain river valleys were derived by selecting WWF's modeled hydrology with upcell values &gt; 500 within the Andes del Norte Assessment area. The &gt;500 upcell cut-off was chosen because the headwaters of streams occur within the Andes, therefore the &gt;20,000 cut off used for the rest of the study area would not have included the majority of rivers in the Andes mountains. Andes mountain plateaus/valleys were derived by selecting all plain, rolling plain and hill landforms (excluding the large valleys - Cauca, Magdelena and Bogota) that occurred within the mountain landform within the Andes del Norte Assessment Area. River valleys, Andes mountain river valleys and Andes mountain plateaus were then combined to form an ESA valleys landform grid. This methodology for modeling valleys was modified during the development of the SSA data. In the SSA, river valleys were not modeled outside of the Andes mountain landforms because narrow river valley riparian ecological systems (as defined within the ESA) were not expected to be found within the SSA lowlands. In the ESA, the Andes del Norte Assessment Area boundary was used as a good reflection of the actual extent of the Andes mountain landforms, but in the SSA the mountain landforms did not coincide as well with ecoregion boundaries. An SSA mountain landform boundary was produced by selecting all major mountain landform polygons, small outlier mountain landform polygons outside of the main Andes mountain landform occurrences were excluded. Mountain river valleys were then modeled within the SSA mountain landform boundary by selecting WWF modeled hydrology with upcell values of &gt;15,000. A review of various upcell cut-off values suggested that &gt;15,000 was representative of the elevations at which the expected SSA Andes riparian ecological systems would be found. SSA Andes Mountain plateau/valleys were derived by selecting plains, rolling plains, and hill landforms within the mountain landform boundary at actual elevations of 3000 meters and below. Plains, rolling plains and hills above 3000 were excluded because different \"Puna\" ecological systems were expected to be found on these different landforms above 3000 meters. The SSA Andes mountain river valleys and Andes mountain plateaus/valleys were then combined to form an SSA valleys landform grid. Coastal Plains were identified as plains (0 - 25 meters) adjacent to the coast and found on alluvial/sedimentary/marine type geology (based on a review of the original, detailed geological classes). Coastal plains extend inland until they are constrained either by incorrect geology or by incorrect landform. A few very narrow fingers of coastal plains that extended far inland were manually clipped off where they began to narrow significantly. In the ESA, floodplains were modeled from a combination of data sources. Floodplains on major rivers were delineated by selecting all major rivers from WWF's modeled hydrology data set with an upcell value &gt;50,000. These streams were buffered by 4 km and the resultant polygons constrained to areas with alluvial/sedimentary floodplain geology (based on a review of the original, detailed geological classes) and plains (0 - 25 meters relative relief) or rolling plains (25 - 50 meters relative relief) landforms. With the assumption that the high volume of water in major rivers would allow flood waters to rise up over terraces, represented as rolling plains landforms, which parallel the rivers. Bernhard Lehner provided a Global Lakes and Wetlands database (2004), a comprehensive compilation of existing global hydrology data sets, which includes good representation of major floodplains and flooded forests. The 4 km floodplain polygon buffers on major rivers were combined with all floodplain and flooded forest polygons that occurred in the Global Lakes and Wetlands database. Floodplains on secondary rivers were delineated by selecting all secondary rivers from WWF's modeled hydrology data set with an upcell value &gt;20,000. These streams were buffered by 3 km and the resultant polygons were constrained to areas with alluvial/sedimentary floodplain geology and plains (0 - 25 meters) landforms, with the assumption that the volume of water in secondary rivers would not allow flood waters to rise up over the terraces. The 3 km floodplain polygon buffers on secondary rivers were also combined with all floodplain and flooded forest polygons that occurred in the Global Lakes and Wetlands database. Floodplain area statistics from Wolfgang Junk's study, General Aspects of Floodplain Ecology with Special Reference to Amazonian Floodplains (1997), were used to identify the optimal buffer size for delineating major and secondary floodplain buffers (see Appendix IV). All floodplains include the open water of their river channels. Upcell cutoff values for identifying major and secondary rivers were based on a visual examination of rivers on other maps. All coastal floodplains with any major or secondary river flowing through them were reclassified as floodplains. Then all three of these input grids (major floodplains, secondary floodplains and coastal floodplains) were combined to produce a final ESA floodplain grid. This methodology for modeling floodplains was modified during the development of the SSA data. On the west coast, few floodplains occur because the Andes mountains extend in most places right to the edge of the continent, while on the east coast, few floodplains occur because the soils are very well drained due to the underlying geology. Therefore in the SSA, only the rivers identified in the Global Lakes and Wetlands database (2003) as having floodplains or flooded forests were modeled using the ESA methodology. Major floodplains were modeled along the Parana, Colarado, and Negro rivers (and their tributaries), secondary floodplains were modeled along the Deseado river. In addition, on the west coast, floodplains were modeled along the Guayaguil river and its tributaries. All coastal floodplains with any major or secondary river flowing through them were reclassified as floodplains. Then all three of these input grids (major floodplains, secondary floodplains and coastal floodplains) were combined to produce a final SSA floodplain grid. The four basic landforms, plateaus, valleys, coastal plains and floodplains grids were combined in the Arcview Raster Calculator to produce the ESA and SSA general landform grids (filenames: esa_genlndf_s and ssa_genlndf_s). The ESA and SSA general landform grids were then mosaiced into a final South America general landform grid (filename: sa_genlndf_s). </procdesc> <procdate>January 2004 - January 2005</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>Metadata imported.</procdesc> <procdate>20100903</procdate> <proctime>08113900</proctime> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Raster</direct> <rastinfo> <rasttype>Pixel</rasttype> <rowcount>16427</rowcount> <colcount>19852</colcount> <vrtcount>1</vrtcount> </rastinfo> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres>0.004167</latres> <longres>0.004167</longres> <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit> </geograph> <geodetic> <horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn> <ellips>WGS_1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257224</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>sa_landform_450m_dd84.img.vat</enttypl> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>ObjectID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Value</attrlabl> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>1</edomv> <edomvd>Plains</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>2</edomv> <edomvd>Rolling Plains</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>3</edomv> <edomvd>Hills</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>4</edomv> <edomvd>Mountains</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>5</edomv> <edomvd>Plateaus</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>6</edomv> <edomvd>Valleys</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>7</edomv> <edomvd>Floodplains</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>8</edomv> <edomvd>Coastal Plains</edomvd> </edom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Count</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Red</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Green</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Blue</attrlabl> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Opacity</attrlabl> </attr> </detailed> </eainfo> <distinfo> <resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc> <stdorder> <digform> <digtinfo> <transize></transize> </digtinfo> </digform> </stdorder> </distinfo> <metainfo> <metd>20100903</metd> <metc> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Roger Sayre</cntper> <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, Geographic Analysis and Monitoring Program</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>Senior Scientist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>physical address</addrtype> <address>519 National Center</address> <city>Reston</city> <state>VA</state> <postal>20192</postal> <country>U.S.A.</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(703) 648-4529</cntvoice> <cntemail>rsayre@usgs.gov</cntemail> </cntinfo> </metc> <metstdn>FGDC Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata</metstdn> <metstdv>FGDC-STD-001-1998</metstdv> <mettc>local time</mettc> <metextns> <onlink>&lt;http://www.esri.com/metadata/esriprof80.html&gt;</onlink> <metprof>ESRI Metadata Profile</metprof> </metextns> </metainfo> </metadata> ",
