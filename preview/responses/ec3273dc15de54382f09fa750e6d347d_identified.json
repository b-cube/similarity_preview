In support of the mapping project, various spatial database boundary coverages were either produced or modified from their original source. These boundary coverages are: 1) Project Boundary, 2) Map Data Boundary, 3) Park Boundary, and 4) Quad Boundary. The spatial coverages are projected in Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 19, with datum in North American Datum of 1983.</abstract>       <purpose>These spatial database coverages were either produced or modified from its original source to support the Acadia National Park Vegetation Mapping Project, USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program. This metadata report supports four spatial database coverages (project boundary, map data boundary, park boundary, and quad boundary).</purpose>       <supplinf>All spatial coverages were produced using ArcView GIS (Version 3.3). The spatial coverages are available as Shapefile sets on the Project?s CD-ROM (file name sets [acad_projbdy], [acad_mapbdy], [acad_parkbdy], and [acad_quadbdy]). The following provides a brief summary of each spatial database: 1) Project Boundary: polygon coverage showing the boundary extent of the mapping project (regardless of map data or no map data). 2) Map Data Boundary: polygon coverage showing the boundaries of map data (those areas actually mapped within the project boundary extent) and no map data (those areas purposely not mapped, yet fall within the project boundary extent). The original source of this coverage is from the project?s vegetation spatial database coverage. 3) Park Boundary: polygon coverage showing access locations of park fee and easement lands (as of 1999). This coverage was modified from its original source (received from Acadia NP, June 1999) to identify accessible lands for the accuracy assessment fieldwork. 4) Quad Boundary: polygon coverage showing boundaries of USGS 3.75-minute and 7.5-minute quadrangles. This coverage was modified from its original source (received from Acadia NP, 1998) to represent those quadrangles within the project boundary.</supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <sngdate>           <caldate>200310</caldate>         </sngdate>       </timeinfo>       <current>publication date</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>None planned</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <descgeog>Acadia National Park, Maine</descgeog>       <bounding>         <westbc>-68.944371</westbc>         <eastbc>-68.023032</eastbc>         <northbc>44.480512</northbc>         <southbc>43.999407</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>None</themekt>         <themekey>USGS Quadrangle</themekey>         <themekey>Fee and Easement</themekey>         <themekey>Acadia National Park Vegetation Mapping Project</themekey>         <themekey>USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>None</placekt>         <placekey>Acadia National Park</placekey>         <placekey>Bar Harbor</placekey>         <placekey>Mount Desert Island</placekey>         <placekey>Schoodic Peninsula</placekey>         <placekey>Isle au Haut</placekey>         <placekey>Hancock County</placekey>         <placekey>Maine</placekey>         <placekey>USA</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>None</accconst>     <useconst>Those using these spatial database sets should understand the data and determine for themselves the fitness of the data prior to use.

The mapping project is one of few listed as pilot, with purpose to test and explore protocols in mapping and classifying vegetation for the VMP. --- The project began with a planning meeting March 1997 at Acadia National Park (NP). Spring photography was collected May 1997, the baseline data for subsequent field efforts and mapping. Vegetation samples were collected over 3 field seasons (1997-1999), with the majority collected during the first 2 years. Photointerpretation and subsequent digital automation transpired during 1998 &amp; 1999, with supporting fieldwork during the 1997 &amp; 1998 field seasons. The first draft of the vegetation map was completed and distributed January 2000. Vegetation data analyses for vegetation classification development were performed during 1999 &amp; 2000. Local vegetation community descriptions were completed 2001. Accuracy assessment field data was collected during the 1999 field season. The data was applied to the vegetation map with concluding results spring 2003. --- The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) provided project coordination and compiled all project data for distribution. The UMESC produced all spatial database sets: vegetation map, observation points, vegetation sample plots, accuracy assessment sites, and various other supporting coverages. The UMESC also performed the accuracy assessment of the vegetation spatial database coverage, prepared final project documentation discussing methods and results, and provided metadata reports. The Nature Conservancy, NatureServe, and Maine Natural Areas Program provided ecological and vegetation support, vegetation field sampling (plot samples and accuracy assessment), data entry, vegetation analysis, methods and results documentation, and vegetation classification development (including vegetation community descriptions) based on the Federal Geographic Data Committee?s National Vegetation Classification Standard with floristic level types defined by NatureServe's International Vegetation Classification (association and alliance classes of the National Vegetation Classification System). Acadia NP provided staff to assist in field efforts including GPS navigation and collection, lodging, boat transportation, and knowledge of the local area. --- The Project provides a technical report with details regarding methods and results. Metadata documents are provided for the vegetation spatial database coverage (vegetation map), field reconnaissance observations, vegetation field plots (samples), accuracy assessment, aerial photography, and project boundaries.</othercit>         <onlink>http://www.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/vip/parks/acad.html</onlink>         <lworkcit>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Geological Survey, Center for Biological Information</origin>             <pubdate>200304</pubdate>             <title>USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program (May 2003)</title>             <geoform>online</geoform>             <serinfo>               <sername>USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program</sername>               <issue>Overview</issue>             </serinfo>             <pubinfo>               <pubplace>Denver, Colorado</pubplace>               <publish>U.S. Geological Survey, Center for Biological Informatics</publish>             </pubinfo>             <othercit>Overview of USGS - NPS Vegetation Mapping Program (taken from http://www.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/csas/vip/about.html, May 2003): The USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping Program is a cooperative effort by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Park Service (NPS) to classify, describe, and map vegetation communities in more than 270 national park units across the United States. This landmark program is both the first to provide national-scale descriptions of vegetation for a federal agency and the first to create national vegetation standards for its data products. Its goal is to meet specific information needs identified by the National Park Service. --- The vegetation mapping program is an important part of the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Program, a long-term effort to develop baseline data for all national park units that have a natural resource component. It is managed by the USGS Center for Biological Informatics, a unique information center designed to help scientists, land managers, the public, and others locate and apply biological information. --- Program activities are based on peer-reviewed, objective science. Comprehensive vegetation information is provided at national and regional levels, while also serving local management needs of individual parks. Stringent quality control procedures ensure that products are accurate and consistent for initial inventory purposes and replicable for monitoring purposes. The spatially enabled digital products produced by the program are available on the World Wide Web. --- Program scientists have developed data collection procedures for classification, mapping, accuracy assessment, and use of existing data. Program products meet Federal Geographic Data Committee standards for vegetation classification and metadata, and national standards for spatial accuracy and data transfer. Standards include a minimum mapping unit of 0.5 hectares and classification accuracy of 80% for each map class. Nature Serve, an important partner in the USGS-NPS Vegetation Mapping program, is the caretaker of the National Vegetation Classification System, which is used by the program to classify vegetation communities. --- A report of project methods and results is provided at completion of individual projects. Project results include a rich set of data and information for each park project, as follows: --- Spatial Data: Aerial photography, Map classification, Map classification description and key, Spatial database of vegetation communities, Hardcopy maps of vegetation communities, Metadata for spatial databases, Complete accuracy assessment of spatial data, Vegetation Information. --- Vegetation classification: Dichotomous field key of vegetation classes, Formal description for each vegetation class, Ground photos of vegetation classes, Field data in database format.</othercit>             <onlink>http://www.usgs.gov/core_science_systems/</onlink>           </citeinfo>         </lworkcit>       </citeinfo>     </crossref>   </idinfo>   <dataqual>     <attracc>       <attraccr>Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy printouts.
