Holmberg, S. Hakansson, G. Eriksson</title>     <dc:date>2015-03-01T08:00:00-00:00</dc:date>     <description>This document describes web-based real-time communication use cases. Requirements on the browser functionality are derived from the use cases.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document was developed in an initial phase of the work with rather minor updates at later stages. It has not really served as a tool in deciding features or scope for the WG's efforts so far. It is being published to record the early conclusions of the WG. It will not be used as a set of rigid guidelines that specifications and implementations will be held to in the future.</description> </item>  <item rdf:about='http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7487.txt'>     <link>http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7487.txt</link>     <title>RFC 7487: Configuration of Proactive Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Functions for MPLS-Based Transport Networks Using RSVP-TE, E.

The existence of the record and any change in its value can be monitored by a parental agent and acted on depending on local policy.</description> </item>  <item rdf:about='http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7476.txt'>     <link>http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7476.txt</link>     <title>RFC 7476: Information-Centric Networking: Baseline Scenarios, K.

Eum</title>     <dc:date>2015-03-01T08:00:00-00:00</dc:date>     <description>This document aims at establishing a common understanding about a set of scenarios that can be used as a base for the evaluation of different information-centric networking (ICN) approaches so that they can be tested and compared against each other while showcasing their own advantages. Towards this end, we review the ICN literature and document scenarios which have been considered in previous performance evaluation studies. We discuss a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address. This includes general aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity, increased scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching performance, real-time communication efficiency, energy consumption frugality, and disruption and delay tolerance. We detail ICN-specific aspects as well, such as information security and trust, persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.&lt;/t>&lt;t> This document is a product of the IRTF Information-Centric Networking Research Group (ICNRG).</description> </item>  <item rdf:about='http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7458.txt'>     <link>http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7458.txt</link>     <title>RFC 7458: Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) Attributes for Wi-Fi Integration with the Evolved Packet Core, R. Valmikam, R. Koodli</title>     <dc:date>2015-02-01T08:00:00-00:00</dc:date>     <description>With Wi-Fi emerging as a crucial access network for mobile service providers, it has become important to provide functions commonly available in 3G and 4G networks in Wi-Fi access networks as well. Such functions include Access Point Name (APN) Selection, multiple Packet Data Network (PDN) connections, and seamless mobility between Wi-Fi and 3G/4G networks.&lt;/t>&lt;t> The EAP Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA), and EAP-AKA', protocol is required for mobile devices to access the mobile Evolved Packet Core (EPC) via Wi-Fi networks. This document defines a few new EAP attributes to enable the above-mentioned functions in such networks. The attributes are exchanged between a client (such as a Mobile Node (MN)) and its network counterpart (such as an Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) server) in the service provider's infrastructure.</description> </item>   </rdf:RDF> ",
