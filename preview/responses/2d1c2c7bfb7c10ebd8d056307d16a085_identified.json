The study was conducted in collaboration with community-based organizations in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Data were collected via written surveys of women who in the preceding year had had sex with a woman (18 years and older; N = 591). Most participating women identified as lesbian and black. Almost half of the women (47.2%) reported ever having had consensual heterosexual sex. Engagement in transactional sex (lifetime) was reported by 18.6% of all women. Forced sex by men or women was reported by 31.1% of all women. A large proportion of the women reported to ever have been tested for HIV (78.3%); number of lifetime female and male partners was independently associated with having been tested; women who had engaged in transactional sex with women only or with women and men were less likely to have been tested. Self-reported HIV prevalence among tested women who knew their serostatus was 9.6%. Besides age, the sole independent predictor of a positive serostatus was having experienced forced sex by men, by women, or by both men and women. Study findings indicate that despite the image of invulnerability, HIV/AIDS is a reality for lesbian and bisexual women in Southern Africa. Surprisingly, it is not sex with men per se, but rather forced sex that is the important risk factor for self-reported HIV infection among the participating women. HIV/AIDS policy should also address the needs of lesbian, bisexual and other women who have sex with women.</abstract>    <subject>       <topic>Public health</topic>    </subject>    <subject>       <topic>GLBT studies</topic>    </subject>    <subject>       <topic>Sociology</topic>    </subject>    <relatedItem type=\"host\">       <titleInfo>          <title>PLoS ONE</title>       </titleInfo>       <part>          <detail type=\"volume\">             <number>8</number>          </detail>          <detail type=\"issue\">             <number>1</number>          </detail>          <extent unit=\"page\">             <start>1</start>             <end>9</end>          </extent>          <date>2013-01</date>       </part>       <identifier type=\"doi\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053552</identifier>       <identifier type=\"issn\">1932-6203</identifier>    </relatedItem>    <identifier type=\"hdl\">http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:21021</identifier>    <location>       <physicalLocation authority=\"marcorg\">NNC</physicalLocation>    </location>    <recordInfo>       <recordContentSource authority=\"marcorg\">NNC</recordContentSource>       <recordCreationDate encoding=\"w3cdtf\">2013-07-11 11:56:24 -0400</recordCreationDate>       <recordChangeDate encoding=\"w3cdtf\">2013-07-11 12:03:36 -0400</recordChangeDate>       <recordIdentifier>11813</recordIdentifier>       <languageOfCataloging>          <languageTerm authority=\"iso639-2b\">eng</languageTerm>       </languageOfCataloging>    </recordInfo> </mods> ",
