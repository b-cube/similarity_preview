The EHS brings together two previous survey series into a single fieldwork operation: the &lt;i&gt;English House Condition Survey&lt;/i&gt; (EHCS) (available from the UK Data Archive under GN 33158) and the &lt;i&gt;Survey of English Housing&lt;/i&gt; (SEH) (available under GN 33277). The EHS covers all housing tenures and provides valuable information and evidence to inform the development and monitoring of the department's housing policies. Results from the survey are also used by a wide range of other users including other government departments, local authorities, housing associations, landlords, academics, construction industry professionals, consultants, and the general public. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The EHS has a complex multi-stage methodology consisting of two main elements; an initial interview survey of around 14,000 households and a follow-up physical inspection. Some further elements are also periodically included in or derived from the EHS: for 2008 and 2009, a desk-based market valuation was conducted of a sub-sample of 8,000 dwellings (including vacant ones), but this was not carried out from 2010 onwards. A periodic follow-up survey of private landlords and agents (the &lt;i&gt;Private Landlords Survey&lt;/i&gt; (PLS)) is conducted using information from the EHS interview survey and from 2012, a Fuel Poverty dataset is also deposited, created by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) from the EHS database.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The EHS interview survey sample formed part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS) (available from the Archive under GN 33420) from April 2008 to April 2011. During this period the core questions from the IHS formed part of the EHS questionnaire. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Further information about the EHS and the latest news, reports and tables can be found on the GOV.UK &lt;a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government/series/english-housing-survey\" title =\"English Housing Survey (EHS)\"&gt;English Housing Survey &lt;/a&gt; web pages.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>The &lt;i&gt;English Housing Survey: Housing Stock Data, 2010/11-2012/13: Three-Year Weights Lookup File&lt;/i&gt; contains four variables to match to the EHS Three-Year Housing Stock dataset. This is not provided with the weights look-up file but can be created by obtaining the EHS 2011 and 2012 Housing Stock datasets (SNs 7386 and 7511 respectively) and merging the two files together to create a three-year dataset covering 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. The weights for the three component years are individually calibrated to the mid-point of October 2011. The three years' weights are then aggregated before being scaled down to the appropriate totals by being divided by three.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The three-year paired weights are used for analysis of small groups when the combined two-year housing stock dataset is not sufficient. However, the weighting methodology for the three-year weight does not give as reliable a result as that for the one- and two-year weights. The depositor advises that users should be aware these data can easily be more biased than plentiful. Users should also note that the three-year paired weights can only be used on the EHS housing stock dataset and not with the household data.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <sumDscr>         <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\">2010</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z\">2013</timePrd>         <nation>England</nation>         <geogUnit>No spatial unit</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit>         <anlyUnit> Families/households</anlyUnit>         <universe>National</universe>         <universe>Dwellings and their occupants in England, 2010-2012.</universe>         <dataKind>Numeric data</dataKind>         <dataKind> Individual (micro) level</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <timeMeth>Repeated cross-sectional study</timeMeth>         <dataCollector>NatCen Social Research</dataCollector>         <dataCollector>Building Research Establishment</dataCollector>         <sampProc>Multi-stage stratified random sample</sampProc>         <deviat>21,255 cases</deviat>         <collMode>Compilation or synthesis of existing material</collMode>         <sources />         <weight>Rounded dwelling weight and rounded household weights for 2010/11-2012/13 are included.</weight>         <weight>Weighting used.
