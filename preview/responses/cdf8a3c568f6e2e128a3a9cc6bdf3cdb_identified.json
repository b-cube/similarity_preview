Interviewing was conducted in four waves: the first  wave in 1963, an election-free year, and the next three waves  subsequent to the general elections in 1964, 1966, and 1970. The  present study contains the master file bringing together the data  resulting from the 1963 national cross-section sample, the 1964 and  1966 electorate samples, and 11 additional panels resulting from  reinterviewing respondents from one or more of the three samples  listed above. Also available through ICPSR are three subsets of these  data: POLITICAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN, 1963 (ICPSR 7232) presents data  obtained from the 1963 national cross-section sample, POLITICAL CHANGE  IN BRITAIN, 1964 (ICPSR 7233) includes the interviews administered to  the 1964 electorate sample, and POLITICAL CHANGE IN BRITAIN, 1966  (ICPSR 7234) contains data resulting from the 1966 electorate  sample. The interviews focused on the phenomenon of political  change. General political attitudes and behaviors were ascertained, as  well as possible sources for their change. Variables assessed  respondents' sources of political information, perceptions of  political parties and leaders, and views on governmental  responsiveness, economic well-being, and other salient issues. Other  questions probed partisan self-identification and the extent of  political participation. The respondents' knowledge of members of  parliament from their constituencies, and perceptions of social class  and trade-union influence were also investigated. Semantic  differential scales were employed to assess respondents' perceptions  of the three main parties. Extensive demographic data were collected,  including age, sex, marital status, number of children, religion, education, occupation, and income.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1963\" cycle=\"P1\">1963</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1970\" cycle=\"P1\">1970</timePrd>                                                           <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1963\" cycle=\"P1\">1963</collDate>                                                <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1964\" cycle=\"P2\">1964</collDate>                                                <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1966\" cycle=\"P3\">1966</collDate>                                                <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1970\" cycle=\"P4\">1970</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Great Britain</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Electorate of England, Scotland, and Wales.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The original sample drawn in 1963 was a self-weighting,  multi-stage, stratified sample of the adult population of England,  Scotland, and Wales living in private households or institutions. The  1964 and 1966 electorate samples consisted of reinterviews with  respondents who were living at 1963 sample addresses and were  registered to vote, as well as interviews with respondents living at  sample addresses added to the 1963 master list to make the samples  representative of the electorates in 1964 and 1966. Only panel samples  were included in 1970, consisting of reinterviews with respondents who  had been surveyed in at least one of the previous three waves. The  four waves of interviewing yielded 14 overlapping, but analytically  distinct, samples. The overlapping occurred because most respondents  qualified for inclusion in more than one sample. Eligibility for a  panel sample depended on the respondent's having been eligible for the  cross-section or electorate sample that marked the beginning point for that panel.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>       <weight>               With the exception of the 1963 cross-section sample, which  is self-weighting, all other samples require the use of a weight  variable, designed to offset the bias introduced by panel mortality.  Weights were assigned to the respondents on the basis of sex and a  Guttman scale of political knowledge questions. They are always two  digits wide with one implied decimal place, and range from 0.8 to  2.1. One weight variable applies to more than one sample in which  there were no differences between the respondents' weights in the electorate sample and the panel sample(s) for related years.     </weight>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
