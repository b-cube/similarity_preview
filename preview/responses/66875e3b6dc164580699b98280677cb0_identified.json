The British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) is similar in purpose to the General Social Survey carried out by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) in the United States. The BSA questionnaire had two parts, one administered by an interviewer and the other completed by the respondent. This survey contained questions on political orientation, including attitudes toward the parties, likely voting behavior in the next British General Election, political tolerance, and relations with other nations. Other topics include beliefs and expectations concerning both national and personal economic conditions, attitudes toward government spending and programs, social problems such as crime and racial prejudice, and attitudes toward marriage and sexual mores. Additional demographic data gathered included age, gender, education, occupation, household income, marital status, social class, and religious and political affiliations.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1983\" cycle=\"P1\">1983</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1983-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1983-03</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1983-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1983-06</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>             <geogCover>Great Britain</geogCover>             <geogCover>United Kingdom</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adults (18 or over) living in private households in Great Britain whose addresses were included in the electoral registers.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Multistage stratified random sample consisting of four stages.
