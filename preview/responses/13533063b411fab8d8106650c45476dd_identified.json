The performance of funerary ritual is one of the hallmarks of the Mycenaean period. The materiality and performative aspects have often been lost in typologies and classificatory approaches concerned with the identity and status of the dead. This paper focuses on the roles of material culture in the spectacle of performance of funerary rites. Strategies for engagement with mortuary processes through material culture are highlighted in the preparation of the corpse, the procession to the tomb, and the production of the interment context. It is argued that two different aspects of death are reconciled during the funeral. The earlier stages emphasise the subject of the funeral. The processes of interment and incorporation of the corpse within the reorganised context of the tomb emphasise the transformation of the individual characteristics of the dead, completed by later rites which incorporated the bones of the dead among the collective material of the tomb.

Demographic change has recently re-emerged as a key explanation for sociocultural&#13; changes documented in the prehistoric archaeological record. While the majority&#13; of studies of Pleistocene demography have been conducted by geneticists, the&#13; archaeological records of the Palaeolithic should not be ignored as a source of&#13; data on past population trends. This paper forms both a comprehensive synthesis&#13; and the first critical review of current archaeological research into&#13; Palaeolithic demography. Within prevailing archaeological frameworks of dual&#13; inheritance theory and human behavioural ecology, I review the ways in which&#13; demographic change has been used as an explanatory concept within&#13; Palaeolithic archaeology. I identify and discuss three main research areas which&#13; have benefitted from a demographic approach to socio-cultural change: (1)&#13; technological stasis in the Lower Palaeolithic, (2) the Neanderthal-Homo sapiens&#13; transition in Europe and (3) the emergence of behavioural modernity. I then&#13; address the ways in which palaeodemographic methods have been applied to&#13; Palaeolithic datasets, considering both general methodological concerns and the&#13; challenges specific to this time period. Finally, I discuss the ability of ethnographic&#13; analogy to aid research into Palaeolithic demography. This is the accepted manuscript.

Cauldrons are categorised into two broad types (projecting-bellied and globular) and four groups. New dating evidence is presented, pushing the dating of these cauldrons back to the fourth century BC. A long held belief that cauldrons are largely absent from Britain and Ireland between 600 and 200 BC is also challenged through this re-dating and the identification of cauldrons dating from 600-400 BC. Detailed examination of the technology of manufacture and physical evidence of use and repair indicates that cauldrons are technically accomplished objects requiring great skill to make. Many have been extensively repaired, showing they were in use for some time. It is argued that owing to their large capacity cauldrons were not used every day but were instead used at large social gatherings, specifically at feasts. The social role of feasting is explored and it is argued that cauldrons derive much of their significance from their use at feasts, making them socially powerful objects, likely to be selected for special deposition.
