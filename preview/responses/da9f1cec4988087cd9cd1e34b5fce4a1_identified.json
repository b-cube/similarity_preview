Levels of contaminants are monitored to determine variations between species and regions, changes over time and effects on individual birds and their populations. The Scheme is funded by CEH, Defra, Natural England, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), the RSPB and the Campaign for Responsible Rodenticide Use (CRRU). Species currently analysed include livers from sparrowhawk, barn owl, kestrel and red kite; addled eggs (collected by licenced egg collectors) from merlin, golden eagle, sea eagle, gannet and sparrowhawk nests. These species were selected as they are vulnerable to pesticides, or because their distribution or prey-preference makes them suitable for monitoring geographical and temporal trends in pesticide and other chemical use. All birds are given a post-mortem examination and tissues (liver, brain, muscle, kidney, bone, fat) and a selection of feathers are archived. This archive provides a unique capacity to determine long-term trends in other chemicals that may be recognised in the future as posing a significant risk to wildlife. In addition, the PBMS analyses otter livers, provided by the Cardiff University Otter Project, for contaminants.</summary><georss:where xmlns:georss=\"http://www.georss.org/georss\"><gml:Envelope srsName=\"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.7:4326\" xmlns:gml=\"http://www.opengis.net/gml\"><gml:lowerCorner>49.00 -10.00</gml:lowerCorner><gml:upperCorner>59.00 5.00</gml:upperCorner></gml:Envelope></georss:where></entry><entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"><title>UPDATED - Trace metals in soils in the West Bristol (Avonmouth) area</title><category>environment</category><link href=\"http://data.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/53f1a4b0-8fa7-4b84-b5fe-28117918560a\"/><id>urn:uuid:53f1a4b0-8fa7-4b84-b5fe-28117918560a</id><generator uri=\"http://www.sdi-suite.de/de/terra-catalog.shtm\" version=\"2.3\">terraCatalog</generator><author><name>Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology</name><email>enquiries@ceh.ac.uk</email></author><updated>2015-03-03T09:55:53Z</updated><summary>Concentrations of trace metals in soils from a grid of sites located around a disused (since 2003) smelting works in the Avonmouth, UK, area.

The data are uncensored and provide a basis for research purposes, and must be viewed in this light. Information on analytical methodologies is also available, including detection limits, from which the user can choose how the data might be interpreted.  The basins studied were the Tweed, Wear, Humber, Great Ouse and Thames. One tributary (the Teviot) and two main-stem sites were monitored in the Tweed Catchment. One site around two-thirds down the catchment of the River Wear was monitored. Humber Basin Monitoring was undertaken for all the tributaries especially near their downstream limits. The Great Ouse was monitored around half way down the catchment. The Thames catchment was monitored upstream and downstream of sewage inputs to the river, prior and post effluent stripping of phosphorus.  This work formed part of a major UK initiative introduced in the early 1990s, the Land Ocean Interaction Study, LOIS, to examine water, chemical and sediment fluxes from the eastern UK rivers to the North Sea. The entire LOIS core monitoring data, including a wider range of determinands, is available from EIDC. As part of this and subsequent work, the initiative was extended to examine a range of catchment basins, from rural to agricultural and industrial/urban impacted ones.  </summary><georss:where xmlns:georss=\"http://www.georss.org/georss\"><gml:Envelope srsName=\"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.7:4326\" xmlns:gml=\"http://www.opengis.net/gml\"><gml:lowerCorner>49.16 -13.41</gml:lowerCorner><gml:upperCorner>60.85 1.77</gml:upperCorner></gml:Envelope></georss:where></entry><entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"><title>UPDATED - Five year record of aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations from Auchencorth Moss</title><category>environment</category><link href=\"http://data.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/3f0820a7-a8c8-4dd7-a058-8db79ba9c7fe\"/><id>urn:uuid:3f0820a7-a8c8-4dd7-a058-8db79ba9c7fe</id><generator uri=\"http://www.sdi-suite.de/de/terra-catalog.shtm\" version=\"2.3\">terraCatalog</generator><author><name>Kerry Dinsmore</name><email>enquiries@ceh.ac.uk</email></author><updated>2015-03-03T09:55:12Z</updated><summary>Dataset contains concentrations of particulate and dissolved organic carbon, inorganic carbon, CO2, CH4 and N2O in the Black Burn stream which drains Auchencorth Moss peatland in South East Scotland.

The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB. Surveys have been carried out in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2007 with repeated visits to the majority of squares.  The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys. In this way we can detect the gradual and subtle changes that occur in the UK's countryside over time.  In addition to habitat areas, species plot, soil plot, linear habitat, freshwater habitat and satellite map data are also produced by Countryside Survey.</summary><georss:where xmlns:georss=\"http://www.georss.org/georss\"><gml:Envelope srsName=\"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.7:4326\" xmlns:gml=\"http://www.opengis.net/gml\"><gml:lowerCorner>49.83726 -9.227701</gml:lowerCorner><gml:upperCorner>60.850441 2.687637</gml:upperCorner></gml:Envelope></georss:where></entry><entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"><title>UPDATED - Land Cover Map 2007 (1km dominant target class, N.

The following samples of terrestrial Reference Animals and Plants (RAPs) were obtained from an area of circa 0.4 km squared:  Molinia caerulea (ICRP RAP Wild Grass defined as Poaceae); Picea sitchensis (ICRP RAP Pine Tree defined as Pinaceae); Apis spp., Bombus spp., Nomada spp. (ICRP RAP Bee defined as Apidea); Apodemus sylvaticus (ICRP RAP Rat defined as Muridae); Earthworms (species in the Family Lumbricidae as defined for the ICRP RAP Earthworm); Deer (belonging to the Family Anatidae (i.e. the ICRP RAP Deer).  Soil samples were also collected from throughout the sampling area. All samples were analysed for multiple elements using ICP-MS/ICP-OES and most for gamma-emitting radionuclides. Results have been used to derive biota-soil concentration ratios.   The ICRP have published their framework for radiation protection of the environment (ICRP Publication 108). This describes the use of RAPs as the basis for their framework. The RAPs are generalised to the taxonomic level of Family. Publication 108 presented dose coefficient values for the selected RAPs and also reviewed data on the effects of ionising radiation to suggest Derived Consideration Reference Levels for each RAP.  In summer 2010 the ICRP released a further report on their protection framework for consultation. This report presented transfer parameter values (organism-media concentration ratios) for Reference Animals and Plants. The report also raised the possibility of identifying a series of sites where samples of each Reference Animal and Plant, and their different lifestages, could be collected and analysed. It was suggested that the resultant data would constitute a set of reference values analogous to approaches used by the ICRP for human radiological protection.</summary><georss:where xmlns:georss=\"http://www.georss.org/georss\"><gml:Envelope srsName=\"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:6.7:4326\" xmlns:gml=\"http://www.opengis.net/gml\"><gml:lowerCorner>50 8</gml:lowerCorner><gml:upperCorner>55.0 -2.0</gml:upperCorner></gml:Envelope></georss:where></entry><entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"><title>UPDATED - WATCH forcing data (WFD) - 20th Century  LWdown (surface incident longwave radiation) 1901-2001</title><category>climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere</category><link href=\"http://data.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385\"/><id>urn:uuid:e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385</id><generator uri=\"http://www.sdi-suite.de/de/terra-catalog.shtm\" version=\"2.3\">terraCatalog</generator><author><name>Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology</name><email>enquiries@ceh.ac.uk</email></author><updated>2015-03-03T09:55:22Z</updated><summary>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.

The study examined 658 eggs collected between 1971 and 2009. Eggs analysed by the PBMS are collected by licensed collectors. Contaminants measured include organochlorine pesticides, total mercury, total PCBs and, for recent years, individual PCB congeners. The PBMS is a long-term, national monitoring scheme that quantifies the concentrations of contaminants in the livers and eggs of selected species of predatory and fish-eating birds in Britain. Levels of contaminants are monitored to determine variations between species and regions, changes over time and effects on individual birds and their populations.
