Nationally,  USGS surface-water data includes more  than 850,000 station years of time-series data that  describe stream levels, streamflow (discharge),  reservoir and lake levels, surface-water quality, and  rainfall. The data are collected by automatic recorders  and manual measurements at field installations  across the Nation.          Data are collected by field personnel or relayed  through telephones or satellites to offices where  it is stored and processed. The data relayed  through the Geostationary Operational Environmental  Satellite (GOES) system are processed automatically  in near real time, and in many cases, real-time data are  available online within minutes.          Once a complete day of readings are received from a  site, daily summary data are generated and stored in  the data base. Recent provisional daily data are  updated on the web once a day when the computation  is completed.          Each USGS Science Center serves the realtime data  of the stations it services. A list of these pages may  be seen at http://water.usgs.gov/realtime.html  Every  District realtime page (some have several pages)  contains a list of the stations for which realtime  data are available and a link to the data for each  station.          Every day, an automatic process retrieves the realtime pages from each Water Mission and parses them to find the stations served and the URL for each station&apos;s data. The station numbers on this list are matched against a master list of USGS stations to find the station name and the latitude/longitude of each realtime station. This information is used to prepare an updated data set.              </supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>Current Conditions have been recorded since 1994 and are available at 15 minute intervals every day.

Recording and  transmission times may be more frequent during critical events.  Data from current sites are relayed to USGS offices via satellite,  telephone, and/or radio telemetry and are available for viewing  within minutes of arrival.           The colored dots on this map depict streamflow conditions  as a percentile, which is computed from the period of record  for the current day of the year. Only stations with at least  30 years of record are used.          The gray circles indicate other stations that were not ranked  in percentiles either because they have fewer than 30 years  of record or because they report parameters other than  streamflow. Some stations, for example, measure stage only.          A percentile is a value on a scale of one hundred that  indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to  or below it. For example, on the map of daily streamflow  conditions a river discharge at the 90th percentile is equal  to or greater than 90 percent of the discharge values  recorded on this day of the year during all years that  measurements have been made.  In general,  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda percentile greater than 75 is considered above normal  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda percentile between 25 and 75 is considered normal  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda percentile less than 25 is considered below normal           In some hydrological studies, particularly those  related to floods, a variation of the percentile  known as the \"percent exceedance\" is used.   It is simply obtained by subtracting the percentile  scale value  from 100 percent.  For example, a  discharge at the 75th percentile is the same as  a discharge at the 25th percent exceedance  (100-75=25).           For an in-depth explanation of how percentiles  are used by the USGS in hydrologic science,  see http://pubs.usgs.gov/twri/twri4a3/pdf/twri4a3-new.pdf#page=22          CLASS values for the flow are:         1    New minimum         2    ge old minimum and le 5th percentile         3    gt 5th percentile and le 10th percentile         4    gt 10th percentile and le 25th percentile         5    gt 25th percentile and le 75th percentile         6    gt 75th percentile and le 90th percentile         7    gt 90th percentile and le old maximum         8    New maximum          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdUSGS CURRENT CONDITIONS FOR THE NATIONS: BUILD CURRENT TABLE OF:   BUILD CURRENT CONDITIONS TABLE - Show a custom current conditions summary table for one or more stations.

Most common is 00011 (instantaneous), but some recorders sample the stream on some very frequent interval and report things like the minimums, maximums, and means of all the samples taken for a longer interval. So, for example, the recorder would output a set of values every 15 minutes that are the min., max., and mean of the values taken every 30 seconds during those 15 minutes. Data from recorders like those would use a statistic code such as 00001 (max), 00002 (min), or 00003 (mean) in the DD. You can query by statistics code, statistics name, either explicitly or using a pattern. Query by Statistics Code Name or Number - By default an exact search is made. To make a partial search the term should be prefixed and suffixed with a % sign. The % sign matches zero or more characters at the location. For example, to find all with \"mean\" enter %mean% in the field. % will match any number of characters (including zero characters) at the location. Use % to retrieve all statistics codes.           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStreamflow Method - Describes the method used to measure the discharge.

That is, whether the vertical distribution of velocity within the cross-section is mostly uniform, standard profile, or non-standard profile. Vert Vel Dstrb Cd  Vert Vel Dstrb Nm  Vert Vel Dstrb Ds UNSP       Unspecified     The vertical velocity distribution was not specified.

STND       Standard      The vertical velocity distribution predominantly matched a standard profile.  NSTD       Non-standard    The vertical velocity distribution has many areas of non-standard velocity distribution.            \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdUse incomplete data for statistics calculation - Compute statistics for months where data for some days of that month are missing.             </eaover>    <eadetcit>none</eadetcit>   </overview>  </eainfo>  <distinfo>   <distrib>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>     </cntorgp>     <cntpos>Ask USGS - Water Webserver Team</cntpos>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>mailing</addrtype>      <address>445 National Center</address>      <city>Reston</city>      <state>VA</state>      <postal>20192</postal>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>1-888-275-8747 (1-888-ASK-USGS)</cntvoice>     <cntemail>http://water.usgs.gov/user_feedback_form.html</cntemail>    </cntinfo>   </distrib>   <distliab>Although this data set has been used by the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the U.S. Geological Survey as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
