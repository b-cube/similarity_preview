Data are provided for the geographical location and political history of the delegates' nations, the delegates' opinions of the importance of the activities and functioning of these three organizations to their nations, changes within the organizations, and the organizations' structures. Other variables focus on the geographical and ideological blocs within the organizations, the delegates' feelings about special group influence, their assessments of the degree of maintenance of world peace by the three organizations, the organizations' relationships with the United Nations, regional diversity, and the effect of membership in the three organizations on their nations' internal and/or external policies. More specifically, the World Health Assembly File (Part 1) includes information on the delegates' assessments of the WHO's programs, its operational services to newly independent nations, and its role in the development of regional organizations. The International Telecommunications Union Conference File (Part 2) includes the delegates' perceptions of the effectiveness of the ITU's secretariat and conflict resolution within the ITU. The Labor Conference File (Part 3) provides data on the delegates' opinions of the possible political effect on their nations of the ILO's technical cooperation activities, the ILO and regional integration, the usefulness of the ILO's research activities to their nations, the significance for their nations in relative terms of the International Labor Conventions, the creation of regional instead of universal standards by the ILO, political biases within the ILO, and the relative significance of belligerent forces and negative world developments that threatened world peace.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1965\" cycle=\"P1\">1965</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1965\" cycle=\"P1\">1965</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>A total of 171 delegates that attended the international conferences in 1965 of three major international organizations: the World Health Organization, the International Telecommunications Union, and the International Labor Union.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          mailback questionnaires             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
