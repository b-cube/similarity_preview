Without surgical and medical interventions, most of the severe CHD cases would not survive after the first year of life. The improved health care for CHD patients has increased CHD prevalence significantly, and it has been estimated that the population of adults with CHD is growing ~5% per year. Understanding the causes of CHD would greatly help improve our knowledge of the pathophysiology, family counseling and planning and possibly prevention and treatment in the future. &#13; &#13; The aim of my thesis was to identify novel or known CHD genes enriched for rare coding genetic variants in isolated CHD cases and learn about the relative performance of different study designs. High-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to sequence all coding genes  (whole exome) coupled with various analytical pipelines and tools to identify candidate genes in different family-based study designs. Since there is no general consensus on the underlying genetic model of isolated CHD, I developed a suite of software tools to enable different family-based exome analyses of de novo and inherited variants (chapter 2) and then piloted these tools in several gene discovery projects where the mode of inheritance was already known to identify previously described and novel pathogenic genes, before applying them to an analysis of families with two or more siblings with CHD.&#13; &#13; Based on the tools developed in chapter 2, I designed a two-stage study to investigate isolated parent-offspring trios with Tetralogy of Fallot (chapter 3). In the first stage, I used whole exome sequence data from 30 trios to identify genes with de novo coding variants. This analysis identified six de novo loss-of-function and 13 de novo missense variants. Only one gene showed recurrent de novo mutations in NOTCH1, a well known CHD gene that has mostly been associated with left ventricle outflow tract malformations (LVOT). Besides NOTCH1, the de novo analysis identified several possibly pathogenic novel genes such as ZMYM2 and ARHGAP35, that harbor de novo loss-of-function variants (frameshift and stop gain, respectively). &#13; &#13; In the second stage of the study, I designed custom baits to capture 122 candidate genes for additional sequencing using NGS in a larger sample size of 250 parent-offspring trios with isolated Tetralogy of Fallot and identified six de novo variants in four genes, half of them are loss-of-function variants. Both of NOTCH1 and its ligand JAG1 harbor two additional de novo mutations (two stop gains in NOTCH1 and one missense and a splice donor in JAG1). The analysis showed a strongly significant over-representation of de novo loss-of-function variants in NOTCH1 (P=3.8 \\ufffd\\ufffd10-9).&#13; &#13; To assess alternative family-based study design in CHD, I combined the analysis from 13 isolated parent-offspring trios with 112 unrelated index cases of isolated atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD) in chapter 4.  Initially, I started with a case/control analysis to test the burden of rare missense variants in cases compared with 5,194 ethnically matching controls and identified the gene NR2F2 (Fisher exact test P=7.7\\ufffd\\ufffd10-07, odds ratio=54). The de novo analysis in the AVSD trios identified two de novo missense variants in the same gene. NR2F2 encodes a pleiotropic developmental transcription factor, and decreased dosage of NR2F2 in mice has been shown to result in abnormal development of atrioventricular septa. The results from luciferase assays show that all coding sequence variants observed in patients significantly alter the activity of NR2F2 target promoters. &#13; &#13; My work has identified both known and novel CHD genes enriched for rare coding variants using next-generation sequencing data. I was able to show how using single or combined family-based study designs is an effective approach to study the genetic causes of isolated CHD subtypes. Despite the extreme heterogeneity of CHD, combining NGS data with the proper study design has proved to be an effective approach to identify novel and known CHD genes. Future studies with considerably larger sample sizes are required to yield deeper insights into the genetic causes of isolated CHD. </summary> <dc:date>2014-02-04T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>High-throughput experimental and computational studies of bacterial evolution</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245138\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Barquist, Lars</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245138</id> <updated>2014-02-04T12:40:42Z</updated> <published>2014-01-07T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">High-throughput experimental and computational studies of bacterial evolution Barquist, Lars The work in this thesis is concerned with the study of bacterial adaptation on short and long timescales. In the first section, consisting of three chapters, I describe a recently developed high-throughput technology for probing gene function, transposon-insertion sequencing, and its application to the study of functional differences between two important human pathogens, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovars Typhi and Typhimurium. In a first study, I use transposon-insertion sequencing to probe differences in gene requirements during growth on rich laboratory media, revealing differences in serovar requirements for genes involved in iron-utilization and cell-surface structure biogenesis, as well as in requirements for non-coding RNA. In a second study I more directly probe the genomic features responsible for differences in serovar pathogenicity by analyzing transposon-insertion sequencing data produced following a two hour infection of human macrophage, revealing large differences in the selective pressures felt by these two closely related serovars in the same environment. The second section, consisting of two chapters, uses statistical models of sequence variation, i.e. covariance models, to examine the evolution of intrinsic termination across the bacterial kingdom. A first collaborative study provides background and motivation in the form of a method for identifying Rho-independent terminators using covariance models built from deep alignments of experimentally-verified terminators from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In the course of the development of this method I discovered a novel putative intrinsic terminator in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In the final chapter, I extend this approach to de novo discovery of intrinsic termination motifs across the bacterial phylogeny. I present evidence for lineage-specific variations in canonical Rho-independent terminator composition, as well as discover seven non-canonical putative termination motifs. Using a collection of publicly available RNA-seq datasets, I provide evidence for the function of some of these elements as bona fide transcriptional attenuators. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>The functional impact of copy number variation in the human genome</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/242182\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Huang, Ni</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/242182</id> <updated>2013-07-25T13:03:43Z</updated> <published>2012-03-06T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The functional impact of copy number variation in the human genome Huang, Ni Copy number variation (CNV) is a class of genetic variation where large segments of the genome vary in copy number among different individuals. It has become clear in the past decade that CNV affects a significant proportion of the human genome and can play an important role in human disease. With array-based copy number detection and the current generation of sequencing technologies, our ability to discover genetic variants is running far ahead of our ability to interpret their functional impact. One approach to close this gap is to explore statistical association between genetic variants and phenotypes. In contrast to the successes of genome-wide association studies for common disease using common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as markers, the majority of disease CNVs discovered so far have low population frequencies and are mainly involved in rare developmental disorders. Another strategy to improve interpretation of genomic variants is to establish a predictive understanding of their functional impact. Large heterozygous deletions are of particular interest, since (i)  loss-of-function (LOF) of coding sequences encompassed by large deletions can be relatively unambiguously ascribed and (ii) haploinsufficiency (HI), wherein only one functional copy of a gene is not sufficient to maintain normal phenotype, is a major cause of dominant diseases.&#13; &#13; This thesis explored both approaches. Initially, I developed an informatics pipeline for robust discovery of CNVs from large numbers of samples genotyped using the Affymetrix whole-genome SNP array 6.0, to support both the association-based and prediction-based study. For the disease association strategy, I studied the role of both common and rare CNVs in severe early-onset obesity using a case-control design, from which a rare 220kb heterozygous deletion at 16p11.2 that encompasses SH2B1 was found causal for the phenotype and an 8kb common deletion upstream of NEGR1 was found to be significantly associated with the disease, particularly in females. Using the prediction-based approach, I characterized the properties of HI genes by comparing with genes observed to be deleted in apparently healthy individuals and I developed a prediction model to distinguish HI and haplosufficient (HS) genes using the most informative properties identified from these comparisons.  An HI-based pathogenicity score was devised to distinguish pathogenic genic CNVs from benign genic CNVs. Finally, I proposed a probabilistic diagnostic framework to incorporate population variation, and integrate other sources of evidence, to enable an improved, and quantitative, identification of causal variants. </summary> <dc:date>2012-03-06T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Mechanisms \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdof\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd change \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdin \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdprotein \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdarchitecture</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/230115\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Buljan, Marija</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/230115</id> <updated>2013-07-25T13:42:26Z</updated> <published>2011-01-11T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Mechanisms \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdof\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd change \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdin \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdprotein \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdarchitecture Buljan, Marija Proteins are the basic building blocks and functional units in all living organisms.&#13; Moreover, differences between species can frequently be explained with&#13; differences in their protein complements. Importantly, proteins are often&#13; composed of segments, i.e. domains that have a certain level of evolutionary,&#13; structural and/or functional independence. The majority of proteins in nature&#13; contain two or more domains, and an individual domain can often occur in&#13; combinations with different domain partners.&#13; In the first part of my thesis, I traced the history of animal gene families&#13; and the proteins these genes encode. By this means, I was able to infer events&#13; where changes in protein domain architectures took place. This showed that&#13; both insertions and deletions of single copy domains preferentially occur at&#13; protein termini, but also that changes are more likely to occur after gene&#13; duplication than organism speciation. Finally, domains that were most&#13; frequently gained were the ones that are related to an increase in organismal&#13; complexity, thus underlining the important role of domain shuffling in animal&#13; evolution.&#13; In the second part of my thesis, I focused on a set of high confidence&#13; domain gain events and investigated the evidence for molecular mechanisms&#13; that caused these domain gains. In agreement with observations from the first&#13; part - that changes preferentially occur at the termini - I have found that the&#13; strongest contribution to gains of novel domains in proteins comes from gene&#13; fusion through the joining of exons from adjacent genes into a novel gene unit.&#13; Two other mechanisms that have been suggested to play a major role in the&#13; evolution of animal proteins, retroposition and middle insertions through&#13; intronic recombination, have a smaller role in comparison to gene fusions. Since&#13; the majority of these domain gains are again observed after gene duplication,&#13; this suggests a powerful mechanism for neofunctionalization after gene&#13; duplication.&#13; iii&#13; Finally, in the last part of my thesis, I address a mechanism that increases&#13; the number and variety of proteins in an organism \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd alternative splicing. In&#13; particular, I investigate the functional consequences of tissue-specific alternative&#13; splicing events. I found that tissue-specific splicing tends to affect exons that&#13; encode protein regions without defined secondary or tertiary structure.&#13; Importantly, it is known that these disordered regions frequently play a role in&#13; protein interactions. In agreement with this, I observed significant enrichment of&#13; tissue-specifically encoded protein segments in disordered binding peptides and&#13; posttranslationally modified sites. A possible result of the finely regulated&#13; alternative splicing of these segments is a tissue-specific rewiring of protein&#13; network. In conclusion, both alternative splicing and domain shuffling can&#13; increase proteome diversity. However, a protein with a new function can often&#13; directly or indirectly shape the functions of other proteins in its environment. </summary> <dc:date>2011-01-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
