This paper is the result of that requirement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average&#xD; was chosen because of its widespread use within the financial sector and importance to the investment community. Williams&#xD; concentrated on the Dow itself, including it's history, the Dow theory, how it is computed, how it relates to business&#xD; cycles, and the DOW'S future. Timothy looked at the Dow from a broader perspective, including a comparison of the Dow with&#xD; other market indicators, viewing the DJIA as an investment portfolio, and a look at the Dow and the stock market crash of&#xD; 1987.</summary>     <dc:date>1990-05-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Mothers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Reponses to Infant Gesture at 17 Months</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/13644\" />     <author>       <name>Seibel, Carly</name>     </author>     <id>http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/13644</id>     <updated>2015-01-12T23:46:01Z</updated>     <published>2013-04-29T00:00:00Z</published>     <summary type=\"text\">Title: Mothers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Reponses to Infant Gesture at 17 Months Authors: Seibel, Carly Abstract: Mothers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd responses to infants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd gestures are proposed as a mechanism for vocabulary&#xD; acquisition. It is known that at 13 months mothers give more object labels to pointing than object&#xD; extensions at a time when infants are learning object labels. However, it is not known how&#xD; mothers respond to infants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd gestures at 17 months when their vocabularies are expanding to&#xD; include a greater variety of word types. Therefore, the current study examined mothers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#xD; responses to three types of infant gestures: points, open-hand reaches, and object extensions at 17&#xD; months to describe maternal provision of object labels, action labels, internal state labels and&#xD; nonlabels. Mother-infant interactions were observed in three communicative contexts designed&#xD; to elicit proto-declarative, ambiguous, and proto-imperative communicative bids. It was found&#xD; that infant pointing dominated in the proto-declarative context and object extensions were most&#xD; prevalent in the proto-imperative context. More points than reaches were seen in the ambiguous&#xD; context. Mothers provided mostly object labels after points and action labels after object&#xD; extensions. Internal state labels occurred at similar rates across gesture types. Findings could&#xD; begin to explain why infants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd gestures are related to their vocabulary sizes. Infant gestures elicit&#xD; verbal responses from mothers that mirror infants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd communicative intents.</summary>     <dc:date>2013-04-29T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Discourse in the English Classroom</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/13643\" />     <author>       <name>Johnson, Amanda</name>     </author>     <id>http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/13643</id>     <updated>2015-01-12T22:02:36Z</updated>     <published>2014-05-01T00:00:00Z</published>     <summary type=\"text\">Title: Discourse in the English Classroom Authors: Johnson, Amanda Abstract: While experts (Nystrand, 1997; Applebee, Langer, Nystrand, and&#xD; Gamoran, 2003) have long encouraged authentic discussion as a means to&#xD; promote literacy learning, teachers rarely engage students in this form of&#xD; dialogic discourse and rely instead on recitations. The more monologic or&#xD; presentational approaches to discussion seem to discourage students\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd active&#xD; involvement and engagement, which is necessary for high achievement. If&#xD; teachers avoid dialogue or do not know how to promote it, they may be&#xD; missing an important opportunity to get students to engage actively in their&#xD; own learning; therefore, they can achieve more.&#xD; The current research includes a literature review of research related to&#xD; authentic discussion and literacy learning. Following an observation&#xD; protocol developed by Hillocks (2009), the researcher analyzes sample high&#xD; school English classes taught by one teacher to reveal discourse patterns and&#xD; to conjecture about how the classroom discourse impacts students\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#xD; development as readers and writers.</summary>     <dc:date>2014-05-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry>   <entry>     <title>Hetero-Masculinity, Homosexual Desire: A Perfect Gay World</title>     <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/13642\" />     <author>       <name>Ismail, Khaled</name>     </author>     <id>http://commons.lib.niu.edu/handle/10843/13642</id>     <updated>2015-01-13T14:35:54Z</updated>     <published>2012-12-01T00:00:00Z</published>     <summary type=\"text\">Title: Hetero-Masculinity, Homosexual Desire: A Perfect Gay World Authors: Ismail, Khaled Abstract: In order to create a world where homosexual desire,&#xD; masculinities, and sex is reconciled, gay pom challenges and presents new ways of framing our&#xD; understanding of sexuality, gender and sex. It does so by offering options that are more fluid and&#xD; interchangeable, and by rearranging normative lines of logic in ways that better fit the gay male&#xD; experience. Several popular categories of gay pom blur the lines between normative&#xD; understandings of sexual identity, masculinity and sexual behavior, allowing space for fluidity&#xD; and a more fulfilling experience of desire. To demonstrate this, I explored three popular&#xD; experiences in online gay pom; Gay-for-pay websites; websites that depict married men and&#xD; fraternity guys engaging in same-sex sexual behavior; and websites that depict same-sex&#xD; behaviors between men in the military, teacher/students in schools, locker rooms, and the work&#xD; place. What I found is that the experiences in these three categories attempt to construct a world&#xD; of fluid sexuality and sex by homoeroticizing the dominant frameworks of masculinity and&#xD; heterosexuality.</summary>     <dc:date>2012-12-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </entry> </feed>  ",
