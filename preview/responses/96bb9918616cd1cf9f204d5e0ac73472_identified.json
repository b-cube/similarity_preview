Digital Globe's Quickbird II satellite images were acquired between 2004 and 2006 and georeferenced to within 1.6 m of their true positions. Reef ecosystem features were digitized directly into a GIS at a display scale of 1:4000 using a minimum feature size of 1000 ms. Benthic features were categorized according to a classification scheme with attributes including zone (location, such as lagoon or forereef, etc.), structure (bottom type, such as sand or patch reef, etc.) and percent hard bottom. Ground validation of habitat features was conducted at 311 sites in 2009. Resulting maps consisted of 1829 features covering 366 kms. Results demonstrate that reef zones occurred in a typical progression of narrow bands from offshore, though forereef, reef flat, shoreline, land, backreef, and lagoon habitats. Lagoon was the largest zone mapped and covered nearly 80% of the atoll, although much of it was too deep to have structures identified from the satellite imagery. Dominant habitat structures by area were pavement and aggregate reef, which covered 29% and 18% of the mapped structures, respectively. Based on the number of features, individual and aggregated patch reefs comprised over 40% of the features mapped. Products include GIS based maps, field videos and pictures, satellite imagery, PDF atlas, and this summary report. Maps and associated data can be used to support science and man a gement activities on Majuro reef ecosystems including inventory, monitoring, conservation, and sustainable development applications\"--Abstract. </Abstract>  <System-Details-Note>System requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader. </System-Details-Note>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reef management Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reefs and islands Monitoring Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reef conservation Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Remote sensing. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reefs and islands Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Maps Remote sensing. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Coral reef ecology Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Maps Remote sensing. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Subject-Added-Topical-Term>Benthos Habitat Marshall Islands Majuro Atoll Maps Remote sensing. </Subject-Added-Topical-Term>  <Added-Entry-Personal-Name>Battista, Timothy Adams, creator. </Added-Entry-Personal-Name>  <Added-Entry-Personal-Name>Menza, Charles W.
