The Great   Powers during this time period are identified as Great Britain, France,   Russia/Soviet Union, Austria-Hungary, Prussia/Germany, Italy, the   United States, Japan, and China. In a Great Power rivalry, there are   periodic military and diplomatic challenges to the status quo disputed   by one or both of the powers. The central hypothesis of this study   concerns the interaction between system uncertainty and the risk   propensity of national decision-makers. Variables measure dispute   initiation, system uncertainty, risk propensity, balance of military   capabilities, arms races, preventive motive, power transition, rival's   possession of second-strike nuclear capability, rival's past behavior,   and current dispute involvement of challenger and rival. Risk attitudes   are measured using Kahneman and Tversky Prospect Theory findings. Part   2, Initiation Variables Data, contains the complete set of variables,  and Part 1, Initiation Final Equation Data, is a subset of Part 2.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1816\" cycle=\"P1\">1816</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1975\" cycle=\"P1\">1975</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1990\" cycle=\"P1\">1990</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1991\" cycle=\"P1\">1991</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                        <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          CORRELATES OF WAR PROJECT: INTERNATIONAL AND CIVIL WAR   DATA, 1816-1992 (ICPSR 9905) and POLITY DATA: PERSISTENCE AND CHANGE IN  POLITICAL SYSTEMS, 1800-1971 (ICPSR 5010)             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 Data for this study were extracted in part from   CORRELATES OF WAR PROJECT: INTERNATIONAL AND CIVIL WAR DATA, 1816-1992   (ICPSR 9905) and POLITY DATA: PERSISTENCE AND CHANGE IN POLITICAL   SYSTEMS, 1800-1971 (ICPSR 5010).
