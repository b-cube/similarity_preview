We do not have any of the other speeches from this trial, so the following reconstruction of events is based on only one point of view. <name type=\"person\">Demo</name> had invested a large amount of money with <name type=\"person\">Protus</name>, who was a grain-merchant. <name type=\"person\">Protus</name> was supposed to take <name type=\"person\">Demo</name>&#8217;s money to <placeName key=\"Sicily\">Sicily</placeName>, buy a shipment of grain with it, transport the grain back to <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, and sell it. <name type=\"person\">Demo</name> would have a share in the profit and could expect to make a huge profit (of course, if the ship sank, he would lose all of his investment).</p> <p><name type=\"person\">Protus</name> hired a ship that was owned by a man named <name type=\"person\">Hegestratus</name>. The ship sailed to <placeName key=\"Sicily\">Sicily</placeName> with <name type=\"person\">Protus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Hegestratus</name> on board, and also a man named <name type=\"person\">Zenothemis</name>. When the ship reached <placeName key=\"Syracuse\">Syracuse</placeName>, a city in <placeName key=\"Sicily\">Sicily</placeName>, <name type=\"person\">Protus</name> bought the grain and loaded it on board the ship.</p> <p>But <name type=\"person\">Hegestratus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Zenothemis</name> had devised a scheme between themselves: they persuaded people in <placeName key=\"Syracuse\">Syracuse</placeName> to invest in the shipment of grain, just as <name type=\"person\">Demo</name> had done. These investors thought that <name type=\"person\">Hegestratus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Zenothemis</name> would use their money to buy a load of grain. But since <name type=\"person\">Demo</name> had already paid for the grain, the two con-men could keep the money. In order to avoid getting caught, they planned to sink the ship once it was at sea, and escape in the lifeboat. They could tell their investors that the grain was lost, and their investment with it. Thus they would be free to keep all the money, and their investors would never learn that the cargo had belonged to someone else all along.</p> <p>When the ship was on its way back to <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, <name type=\"person\">Hegestratus</name> tried to cut a hole in its bottom. He was caught in the act, however, jumped overboard to escape, and drowned.</p> <p>When the ship arrived in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, <name type=\"person\">Protus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Demo</name> (who owned the cargo of grain) went to unload the ship. But <name type=\"person\">Zenothemis</name> was also trying to unload the ship, claiming that the grain belonged to him. <name type=\"person\">Protus</name> and <name type=\"person\">Demo</name> prevented him from taking the grain, but <name type=\"person\">Zenothemis</name> sued them in court.</p> <p>Again, it is important to remember that we have only one side of this story. <name type=\"person\">Zenothemis</name>&#8217; speeches in this trial might well have told a very different story. Two other speeches by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> have to do with investments in ships cargoes (often called <soCalled>bottomry loans</soCalled> or <soCalled>maritime loans</soCalled>); see <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 34\" n=\"Dem. 34\">Dem. 34</bibl> and <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 35\" n=\"Dem. 35\">Dem. 35</bibl>.</p> <byline>Christopher Blackwell</byline> </div0>   </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
