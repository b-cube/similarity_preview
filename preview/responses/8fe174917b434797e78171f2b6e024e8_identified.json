It was a challenging situation that brought many lessons learned from the beginning for all sectors involved. Many practices can now be revised and adapted to future management plan writing efforts. However, as challenging as the Culebra experience was, all participants agreed on the main concept: it is essential to involve the public at some level during the development of a management plan if the authorities expect the public to comply with the plan after its implementation. </Abstract>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20090811000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/project/1167/CulebraMgmtPlan_LessonsLearned_2008.pdf </URL>  <project>  <ID>1167 </ID>  <title>Strengthening Puerto Rico's Coral Reef Management </title>  <PI>Eileen Alicea </PI>  </project>  <Region>PR </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-65.248715 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>-67.399870 </Westbc>  <Southbc>17.784130 </Southbc>  <Northbc>18.645740 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>techreport </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>techreport </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
