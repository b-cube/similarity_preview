Operating without mandatory retirement may have consequences for performance management, the creation of opportunities for new generations of workers, the scope for workforce planning and employment costs. Drawing on comparative experiences of Australian universities, which have been operating without mandatory retirement since the 1990s, this article critically examines whether these consequences have materialised in Australia. It draws out a number of lessons for UK universities from the Australian experience. This is the accepted manuscript.  The paper is currently under embargo pending publication. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Pursuing global justice through international criminal law: foreword</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246870\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Nouwen, Sarah M.H.</name> </author> <author> <name>Werner, Wouter G.</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246870</id> <updated>2015-02-18T14:30:23Z</updated> <published>2014-12-24T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Pursuing global justice through international criminal law: foreword Nouwen, Sarah M.H.; Werner, Wouter G.

H.; Werner, Wouter G. Over the past two decades, international criminal law has been increasingly institutionalized and has become one of the dominant frames for defining issues of justice and conflict resolution. Indeed, international criminal law is often presented as the road towards global justice. But the rise of international criminal law and its equation with global justice come with a profound risk: alternative conceptions of justice can be marginalized. Based on field work in Uganda and Sudan, we present five examples of alternative conceptions of justice that in fact have been side-lined: the restoration of relationships, putting an end to on-going violence, redistribution, non-criminal law forms of punishment and equality. However, international criminal law\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds monopolization of discourses of justice threatens not only alternative conceptions of justice, but also international criminal law itself. It frustrates one of its main aims: the protection of diversity. This is the accepted manuscript.
