Longitudinal evidence from eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey Martin, Adam; Goryakin, Yevgeniy; Suhrcke, Marc Objective. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between active travel and psychological&#13; wellbeing.&#13; Method. This study used data on 17,985 adult commuters in eighteen waves of the British Household Panel Survey&#13; (1991/2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2008/9). Fixed effects regression models were used to investigate how (i.) travel mode choice, (ii.)&#13; commuting time, and (iii.) switching to active travel impacted on overall psychological wellbeing and how (iv.)&#13; travel mode choice impacted on specific psychological symptoms included in the General Health Questionnaire.&#13; Results.After accounting for changes in individual-level socioeconomic characteristics and potential confounding&#13; variables relating to work, residence and health, significant associations were observed between overall psychological&#13; wellbeing (on a 36-point Likert scale) and (i.) active travel (0.185, 95% CI: 0.048 to 0.321) and public transport&#13; (0.195, 95% CI: 0.035 to 0.355) when compared to car travel, (ii.) time spent (per 10 minute change) walking&#13; (0.083, 95% CI: 0.003 to 0.163) and driving (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.033, 95% CI: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.064 to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.001), and (iii.) switching&#13; from car travel to active travel (0.479, 95% CI: 0.199 to 0.758). Active travel was also associated with reductions&#13; in the odds of experiencing two specific psychological symptoms when compared to car travel.&#13; Conclusion. The positive psychological wellbeing effects identified in this study should be considered in cost\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; benefit assessments of interventions seeking to promote active travel.

M.; Woodcock, James; Scarborough, Peter The Brighton declaration arose out of a one day workshop&#13; held in Brighton in September 2013 as part of the Society&#13; for Social Medicine annual conference. The workshop&#13; convened UK based non-communicable disease modellers&#13; to discuss the challenges and opportunities for non-communicable&#13; disease modelling in the UK. The declaration&#13; describes the value and importance of non-communicable&#13; disease modelling, both for research and for informing&#13; health policy. The declaration also describes challenges&#13; and issues for non-communicable disease modelling. The&#13; declaration has been endorsed by many non-communicable&#13; disease modellers in the UK. This is the final published version.

An ethnographic study of choice and English end-of-life care</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245560</link> <description>Planning for death? An ethnographic study of choice and English end-of-life care Borgstrom, Erica In 2008 the National End of Life Care Strategy was released in England to create a largescale change in the way dying patients were cared for. This dissertation explores the meaning, practice, and experiences of end-of-life care (EOLC). It is based on ethnographic fieldwork from 2010-2012 that follows policy into and across healthcare practice and the daily lives of those living with life-limiting conditions. The first part of the study analyses the discourse of policy as evident in documents, policy events, and interviews with policy-makers, to understand the core values and motivations within this new field. By emphasising patient choice through advance care planning as a way to facilitate a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgood death\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, these polices have reshaped how persons, as dying patients, could be known and how they are positioned within the healthcare system as autonomous, reflective individuals.&#13; &#13; Documents like the Preferred Priorities for Care are used to facilitate this process. As observed during clinical visits and expressed in interviews, healthcare professionals selectively use such forms, thereby demonstrating varying professional values, and treat their completion as a task. The layout and use of the forms influences professional-patient interaction and the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdchoices\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that can be made.&#13; &#13; The second half of the dissertation focuses on the experiences of those who are the subject of EOLC policy and is based on long-term interaction with 10 people (up to 14 months), often in their own homes and involving their daily routines and family; this is supplemented by an additional 43 in-depth interviews and observations of support groups. Being embedded in a social web of relations was a prominent feature of our encounters.&#13; &#13; Maintaining familial relationships and roles is important to people and they do this by navigating the flow of care and concern within the family.  Assumptions about the linear trajectory of dying and the finitude of death are challenged by people\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds experiences of prolonged waiting and incomplete endings as they continued to be entangled in social relationships.&#13; &#13; Consequently a wider notion of personhood beyond individual patienthood should be adopted for understanding living at the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdend of life\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. Shifting the focus from choice as an individual act and object to one of interaction, I demonstrate how a relational approach to the study of end-of-life care challenges the emphasis on the dying individual and the dichotomy between care and choice. Overall, this ethnography demonstrates the difference between how policy conceptualises end of life and choice and the way people, who may be in this category, experience living with life-limiting conditions. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-10T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245109\"> <title>Effects of changes in the economic environment on diet- and physical activity related behaviours and corollary outcomes: a large-scale scoping review.</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245109</link> <description>Effects of changes in the economic environment on diet- and physical activity related behaviours and corollary outcomes: a large-scale scoping review. Shemilt, Ian; Hollands, Gareth J; Marteau, Theresa M; Jebb, Susan A; Kelly, Michael P; Nakamura, Ryota; Suhrcke, Marc; Ogilvie, David Changing the economic environment has some potential to influence patterns of diet and physical activity and thereby improve population health and reduce inequalities. We conducted a systematic scoping review to identify and describe current evidence for the effects of either specific interventions that change prices or income, or general exposure to variations in prices or income, on diet- and physical activity-related behaviours, their proximal consequences (food, energy or nutrient intake or energy expenditure) and their more distal consequences (risk factors for non-communicable diseases).
