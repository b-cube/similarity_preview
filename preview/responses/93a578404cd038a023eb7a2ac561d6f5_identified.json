At a time when major facets of the subject are being, perhaps have been superseded - for example onshore controlled source crustal seismology by passive seismic methods - and so are becoming \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhistorical\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, this meeting has been designed to explore the UK\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds contribution to Seismology. While science does not recognize national boundaries, the seismological work that has been undertaken in the UK since at least the time of Robert Hooke and the founding of the Royal Society is peculiarly amenable to presentation at an Institute of Physics History of Physics Group sponsored meeting.</p> <p>The meeting has been divided into four sessions; Earthquakes, Instruments and Institutions, Controlled Source Seismology and Crustal Studies, and Passive Seismology. To ensure the content is not just a reflection of science past, the sessions include topics that highlight outstanding current work, and speakers have been asked to consider future trends in their particular field.</p> <p>Twenty-two speakers will cover such varied topics as Early British Thinking on Earthquakes, Prediction, Quiet Earthquakes, Test-ban Verification, Schools\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Seismology, Seismic Investigations of the Ocean Floor, Seismology and the Oil and Gas Industry, Tomography and the Outer Earth, Anisotropy, Interferometry and Seismic Noise, Helioseismology, and more.</p> <p>The meeting will take place over two days, posters being displayed throughout. There will be a conference dinner. The accompanying person programme will include a visit to the Richard III exhibition and tomb, if there is demand.</p> <p>Registration can be completed at\\ufffd\\ufffd<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://shop.le.ac.uk/\">http://shop.le.ac.uk</a><br />(search for Seismology)</p> <p><strong>Full Registration</strong> ends on 20th March 2015</p> </div>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>pkm</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>histseis</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-11T22:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2015-archive-1/march/when-should-blood-transfusions-be-given-after-cardiac-surgery\">     <title>When should blood transfusions be given after cardiac surgery?</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2015-archive-1/march/when-should-blood-transfusions-be-given-after-cardiac-surgery</link>     <description>Professor Gavin Murphy involved in study at Bristol</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Professor Gavin Murphy (pictured), British Heart Foundation (BHF) Professor of Cardiac Surgery, formerly of the University of Bristol\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds School of Clinical Sciences and now\\ufffd\\ufffdfrom the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/cardiovascular-sciences\">Department of Cardiovascular Sciences </a>at Leicester\\ufffd\\ufffdhas been involved in a new study from the University of Bristol that has shown that patients having heart surgery do not benefit if doctors wait until a patient has become substantially anaemic before giving a transfusion.</p> <p>In the UK, about half of all patients having cardiac surgery are given a red blood cell transfusion after the operation, using up to ten per cent of the nation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds blood supply. The proportion of patients having a transfusion is high because blood loss and severe anaemia are common after cardiac surgery and transfusion is the preferred treatment. Blood loss causes anaemia which doctors detect by measuring the red cell count or haemoglobin level \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd a low level triggers transfusion.</p> <p>Cardiac surgery patients who receive blood transfusions are believed to have more complications such as infections, heart attacks and strokes, and this has led to speculation that avoidance of transfusion will improve clinical outcomes.</p> <p>Professor Murphy said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdExisting national and international transfusion guidelines recommend that blood transfusions only be given to patients who develop very low haemoglobin concentrations. We have shown that this strategy may increase the number of deaths in cardiac surgery.</p> <p>\"This was the largest randomised trial ever conducted in the UK in a surgical or cardiac surgery population. It was the largest trial ever conducted that has considered indications for transfusion in cardiac surgery, and recruited over twice the number of patients recruited in all the previous trials put together. It was a pragmatic effectiveness trial that recruited patients from the majority of NHS cardiac surgery centres in the UK and therefore reflects current UK practice and is relevant to UK patients.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cardiovascular</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-03-11T22:05:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/english/existing-staff-and-students/english-ug-ss-guide-1.4\">     <title>English UG SS Guide 1.4</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/english/existing-staff-and-students/english-ug-ss-guide-1.4</link>     <description></description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mn29</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-03-11T16:50:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>File</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/kr3events/getting-here\">     <title>Getting here</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/kr3events/getting-here</link>     <description></description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p class=\"important\">Please note that parking is limited on the University campus, so we recommend arriving by foot, bus or bike if possible.</p> <h2 class=\" \">Getting to the University from Leicester Railway Station</h2> <h3 class=\" \">On Foot</h3> <p>Leicester Railway Station is within walking distance of the University (15 minutes).
