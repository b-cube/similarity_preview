Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.  In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.  In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. </abstract> <purpose>This shapefile contains 8 sound velocity profile locations collected with an Applied Acoustics SV Plus velocimeter by the U.S. Geological Survey during USGS survey 2005-04-FA.

This information is used to correct any refraction artifacts that may be present within the swath bathymetric data due to unaccounted for changes in the speed of sound throughout the water column. As such, the swath bathymetric acquisition is described here, as well as acquisition procedures for the sound velocity profiles.  Swath-bathymetric and acoustic-backscatter data were acquired with a SEA, Ltd., Submetrix 2000 Series interferometric sonar operating at a 234-kHz frequency. The SEA Submetrix 2000 Series transducers were mounted at the bow of the USGS R/V Rafael. Approximately 37 km of swath bathymetric data were collected.  SEA RTS2000 acquisition software (version year 2005) was used to digitally log the bathymetric data at a maximum 50 meter range (100 meter swath width) and 2048 samples per ping in the SEA SXR format. In shallow water areas, the swath width did not achieve the full 50-meter range, but varied from roughly 5x water depth to the maximum 50-meter range (i.e. swath width varied from approximately 15 meter to 100 meters depending on water depth). Data collection parameters are saved as a RTS2000 session file in SEA SXS format.  An Octopus F180R Attitude and Positioning system (see: &lt;http://www.codaoctopus.com/motion/f180/index.asp&gt;) recorded ship motion (heave, pitch, roll, and yaw). These data were transmitted via network connection to the RTS2000 data acquisition software. The Octopus F180R Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was mounted directly above the SEA Submetrix 2000 Series transducers, to minimize lever arm offsets that can lead to positioning errors. The F180R uses two L1 antennas for position and heading accuracy. The antennas are mounted on a rigid horizontal pole, 3 meters above the F180R IMU, with a horizontal separation of 1 meter and are offset from the IMU in a forward/aft configuration. The forward offset of the primary antenna from the IMU is 0.5 meters, with no port/starboard offset.  Eight sound-velocity profiles were acquired during survey operations at roughly 1 to 3 hour intervals using an Applied Microsystems SV Plus Velocimeter (Applied Microsystems, 2008).  Vertical accuracy of the raw data based on system specifications may approximate 1% of water depth, 0.01 to 0.15 meters within the survey area. However, overall vertical accuracies on the order of 0.5 meters are assumed based on the following considerations: WAAS navigation vertical accuracies; the Coda Octopus F180 Attitude and Positioning system, used to correct for vessel roll, pitch, heave, and yaw, has a theoretical vertical accuracy of a few mm; refraction artifacts were minimized by acquiring a range of sound velocity profiles with a hand-casted Applied MicroSystems SV Plus sound velocimeter during the survey. Changes in ship draft due to water and fuel usage were not considered. </srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> Eight sound velocity casts were collected at roughly 3 hour intervals during USGS field activity 2005-004-FA using an Applied Microsystems SV Plus velocimeter  (see http://www.appliedmicrosystems.com/). At each station, the SV Plus was hand deployed and slowly lowered to the lakefloor. The SV Plus was monitored by a member of the science party and as the instrument made contact with the lakefloor, the position (i.e. location) was recorded in the lab using HYPACK navigation software. The position was then manually recorded within the cruise log and RTS2000 acquisition software. Upon recovery, the SV Plus was connected to an onboard computer via serial port in order to download data using the SV Plus communications software, SmartTalk.  Software: SV Plus v2 SmartTalk (no version)  Jane F. Denny performed this and all subsequent process steps. </procdesc> <procdate>2005</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Jane F.
