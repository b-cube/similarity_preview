Protecting areas from the threats posed by human activity will by definition inhibit some human actions. However, adverse impacts could be balanced by maintaining ecosystem services or introducing new livelihood options. Consequently there is an ongoing debate on whether the net impact of PAs on human well-being at local or regional scales is positive or negative. We report here on a systematic review of evidence for impacts on human well-being arising from the establishment and maintenance of terrestrial PAs. Methods: Following an a priori protocol, systematic searches were conducted for evidence of impacts of PAs post 1992. After article title screening, the review was divided into two separate processes; a qualitative synthesis of explanations and meaning of impact and a review of quantitative evidence of impact. Abstracts and full texts were assessed using inclusion criteria and conceptual models of potential impacts. Relevant studies were critically appraised and data extracted and sorted according to type of impact reported. No quantitative synthesis was possible with the evidence available. Two narrative syntheses were produced and their outputs compared in a metasynthesis. Results: The qualitative evidence review mapped 306 articles and synthesised 34 that were scored as high quality. The quantitative evidence review critically appraised 79 studies and included 14 of low/medium susceptibility to bias. The meta-synthesis reveals that a range of factors can lead to reports of positive and negative impacts of PA establishment, and therefore might enable hypothesis generation regarding cause and effect relationships, but resulting hypotheses cannot be tested with the current available evidence. Conclusions: The evidence base provides a range of possible pathways of impact, both positive and negative, of PAs on human well-being but provides very little support for decision making on how to maximise positive impacts. The nature of the research reported to date forms a diverse and fragmented body of evidence unsuitable for the purpose of informing policy formation on how to achieve win-win outcomes for biodiversity and human well-being. To better assess the impacts of PAs on human well-being we make recommendations for improving research study design and reporting.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/2/1/19</link>                 <dc:creator>Andrew Pullin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mukdarut Bangpan</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Sarah Dalrymple</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kelly Dickson</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Neal Haddaway</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>John Healey</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Hanan Hauari</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Neal Hockley</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Julia P G Jones</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Teri Knight</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Carol Vigurs</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Sandy Oliver</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2013, null:19</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-10-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-2-19</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-2-19-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>19</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-10-28T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/1/1/6\">         <title>Comparison of methods for measuring and assessing carbon stocks and carbon stock changes in terrestrial carbon pools. How do the accuracy and precision of current methods compare? A systematic review protocol</title>         <description>Background: Climate change and high rates of global carbon emissions have focussed attention on the need for high-quality monitoring systems to assess how much carbon is present in terrestrial systems and how these change over time. The choice of system to adopt should be guided by good science. There is a growing body of scientific and technical information on ground-based and remote sensing methods of carbon measurement. The adequacy and comparability of these different systems have not been fully evaluated. Methods: A systematic review will compare methods of assessing carbon stocks and carbon stock changes in key land use categories, including, forest land, cropland, grassland, and wetlands, in terrestrial carbon pools that can be accounted for under the Kyoto protocol (above- ground biomass, below-ground biomass, dead wood, litter and soil carbon). Assessing carbon in harvested wood products will not be considered in this review.DiscussionDeveloping effective mitigation strategies to reduce carbon emissions and equitable adaptation strategies to cope with increasing global temperatures will rely on robust scientific information that is free from biases imposed by national and commercial interests. A systematic review of the methods used for assessing carbon stocks and carbon stock changes will contribute to the transparent analysis of complex and often contradictory science.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/1/1/6</link>                 <dc:creator>Gillian Petrokofsky</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Hideki Kanamaru</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Fr\\ufffd\\ufffdd\\ufffd\\ufffdric Achard</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Scott Goetz</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Hans Joosten</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Peter Holmgren</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Aleksi Lehtonen</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mary Menton</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Andrew Pullin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Martin Wattenbach</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2012, null:6</dc:source>         <dc:date>2012-06-21T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-1-6</dc:identifier>                             <dc:title>A protocol outlining a systematic review on reducing carbon emissions</dc:title>                             <dc:description>This protocol for a systematic review on carbon stocks and carbon stock changes in terrestrial carbon pools provides an exhaustive comparative literature review in the field, and outlines the proposed approach for a systematic review on the subject.

A systematic review</title>         <description>Background: Within developing countries, groundwater provides an alternative drinking source to polluted surface water. However, the presence of arsenic in some groundwater sources has resulted in chronic worldwide poisoning. The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of field-based technologies for the removal of arsenic from groundwater in developing countries. Methods: A structured search strategy was conducted in a range of databases. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened using pre-defined inclusion criteria. Included studies were quality appraised prior to data extraction. The primary outcome was the percentage of effluent water samples meeting WHO guidelines for arsenic concentrations (&#8804;0.01&#160;mg/L). Secondary outcomes included: (a) arsenic concentrations in effluent water samples meeting the national guideline limit (&#8804;0.05&#160;mg/L), (b) arsenic concentrations in human tissue, and (c) knowledge and attitudes related to the interventions. Results: Fifty-one reports, evaluating 50 different technologies, were included. Sixty-seven percent (n&#8201;=&#8201;34) of studies were conducted in Bangladesh. Fifty of the included reports were appraised as &#8216;weak&#8217;, with one &#8216;strong&#8217; report of a randomised-controlled trial.In summary, the effectiveness of the oxidation and filtration interventions is poor, while the evidence for coagulation, co-precipitation and filtration, subterranean and membrane and electrolytic methods is mixed. Evidence regarding adsorption and zero valent iron interventions is more persuasive with most results suggesting good evidence of effectiveness (i.e. &#8805;95% of samples with arsenic concentrations &#8804;0.01&#160;mg/L). In particular, activated alumina and sono/three-kolshi/gagri/pitcher filters have &#8805;95% of samples meeting national guidelines. Disappointingly, only one study reports excellent evidence of effectiveness: BRAC (2000) for activated alumina (i.e. &#8805;95% of samples with arsenic concentrations &#8804;0.01&#160;mg/L).The success of each technology was highly dependent on context, especially their acceptability to users, a sense of ownership and expectations of women&#8217;s roles in society. Conclusions: Most studies were poorly conducted and reported. Consequently, although some technologies met national guidelines, the evidence-base for decision-making regarding arsenic mitigation technologies at household- and community-level is weak. To improve this situation, primary research needs to be commissioned with adequate sample sizes, testing the impact of key contextual factors, using valid tools for analysis, and meeting standards for completeness of reporting.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/2/1/11</link>                 <dc:creator>Tracey Jones-Hughes</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jaime Peters</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Rebecca Whear</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Chris Cooper</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Hywel Evans</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Michael Depledge</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Mark Pearson</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2013, null:11</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-05-31T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-2-11</dc:identifier>                             <dc:title>Poor monitoring of technology means groundwater remains contaminated with Arsenic</dc:title>                             <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Technology is inadequately assessed for effectiveness to reduce arsenic contamination in groundwater. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many investigations into the effectiveness of these intervention strategies are poorly devised and thus cannot be relied upon to provide an evidence base for policy making. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-2-11-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>11</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-05-31T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/2/1/2\">         <title>Assessing community-based conservation projects: A systematic review and multilevel analysis of attitudinal, behavioral, ecological, and economic outcomes</title>         <description>Background: Community-based conservation (CBC) promotes the idea that long-term conservation success requires engaging with, and providing benefits for local communities. Though widespread, CBC projects are not always successful or free of controversy. With criticisms on all sides of the conservation debates, it is critical to have a better understanding of (1) whether CBC is an effective conservation tool, and (2) of the factors associated with the success or failure of CBC projects, and the scale at which these factors operate. Recent CBC reviews have typically examined only a single resource domain, have limited geographic scope, consider only one outcome, or ignore the nested nature of socioecological systems. To remedy these issues, we use a newly coded global comparative database of CBC projects identified by systematic review to evaluate success in four outcome domains (attitudes, behaviors, ecological, economic) and explore synergies and tradeoffs among these outcomes. We test hypotheses about how features of the national context (H-NC), project design (H-PD), and local community characteristics (H-CC) affect these four measures of success. Methods: To add to a sample of 62 projects that we used from previous systematic reviews, we systematically searched the conservation literature using six terms in four online databases. To increase the number of projects for each country in order to conduct a multilevel analysis, we also conducted a secondary search using the Advancing Conservation in a Social Context online library. We coded projects for 65 pieces of information. We conducted bivariate analyses using two-dimensional contingency tables and proportional odds logistic regression and conducted multivariate analyses by fitting reduced form proportional odds logistic regression models that were selected using a forward stepwise AIC approach. Results: The primary and secondary searches produced 74 new projects to go along with the 62 projects from previous reviews for a total of 136 projects. The analyses suggest that project design, particularly capacity building in local communities, is critical in generating success across all outcomes. In addition, some community characteristics, such as tenure regimes and supportive cultural beliefs and institutions, are important for some aspects of project success. Surprisingly, there is less evidence that national context systematically influences project outcomes. Conclusions: Our study supports the idea that conservation projects should be carefully designed to be effective and that some characteristics of local communities can facilitate success. That well-designed projects can prevail over disadvantages relating to the pre-existing national and local context is encouraging. As the evidence base on CBC grows, it will be useful to repeat this analysis with additional search terms, and consider additional variables related to national context to further evaluate the role of broader socio-political and economic contexts.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/2/1/2</link>                 <dc:creator>Jeremy Brooks</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kerry Waylen</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Monique Mulder</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2013, null:2</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-01-31T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-2-2</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-2-2-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>2</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-01-31T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/2/1/7\">         <title>What are the impacts of urban agriculture programs on food security in low and middle-income countries?</title>         <description>Background: Issues of food security and nutrition have wide reaching implications for people and their environments, particularly in low and middle-income countries. One proposed solution is urban agriculture, which has been widely upheld as a solution to the food-crisis facing increasingly metropolitan populations. It is believed to provide the urban poor with food and a source of potential income, whilst improving the urban environment and reducing pressure on finite farmland. Although it faded from many development agendas in the 1990&#8217;s, urban agriculture has seen a resurgence since a peak in global food prices in the late 2000&#8217;s. There are, however, potential disadvantages to this increasing drive for urban agriculture including associated urban health risks and implications for the environment. The usage of waste-water, for example, may contaminate produced food and intensive irrigation might lead to the spread of malaria and water borne diseases, as well as threatening already limited water supplies. Soil erosion and the intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides might also present health risks to urban populations and damage the environment. Despite the potential benefits and harms of urban agriculture, the evidence-base is not well understood. Given the current policy drive to promote urban agriculture, there is an urgent need to understand its effects on urban populations and their environments.Methods/designThis review will seek out, select, appraise and synthesise evidence on the impacts of urban agriculture on food security and nutrition. We will employ systematic review methodology to ensure that our review of the evidence is comprehensive, transparent and replicable. In addition to searching electronic databases, we will examine websites and contact academics, practitioners and policy-makers for relevant research. All potentially relevant literature will be screened against pre-specified criteria and assessed for risk of bias using established critical appraisal tools. This is to ensure that we only include the evidence in which we have confidence. Depending on the nature of the available data, we will then synthesise the available evidence using statistical meta-analysis and/or narrative synthesis. Our findings will be disseminated in a variety of ways to ensure that the evidence is available for policy-makers and practitioners.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/2/1/7</link>                 <dc:creator>Ruth Stewart</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Marcel Korth</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Laurenz Langer</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Shannon Rafferty</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Natalie Da Silva</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Carina van Rooyen</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2013, null:7</dc:source>         <dc:date>2013-04-24T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-2-7</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-2-7-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>7</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2013-04-24T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/4\">         <title>What are the impacts of reindeer/caribou ( Rangifer tarandus L.) on arctic and alpine vegetation? A systematic review</title>         <description>Background: The reindeer (or caribou, Rangifer tarandus L.) has a natural range extending over much of Eurasia&#8217;s and North America&#8217;s arctic, alpine and boreal zones, yet its impact on vegetation is still unclear. This lack of a common understanding hampers both the management of wild and semi-domesticated reindeer populations and the preservation of biodiversity. To achieve a common platform, we have undertaken a systematic review of published studies that compare vegetation at sites with different reindeer densities. Besides biodiversity, we focused on effects on major plant growth forms. Methods: Searches for literature were made using online publication databases, search engines, specialist websites and bibliographies of literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Finnish, Norwegian, Russian and Swedish. Identified articles were screened for relevance based on titles, abstracts and full text using inclusion criteria set out in an a priori protocol. Relevant articles were then subject to critical appraisal of susceptibility to bias. Data on outcomes such as abundance, biomass, cover and species richness of vegetation were extracted together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect modifiers. Results: Our searches identified more than 6,000 articles. After screening for relevance, 100 of them remained. Critical appraisal excluded 60 articles, leaving 40 articles with 41 independent studies. Almost two thirds of these studies had been conducted in Fennoscandia. Meta-analysis could be made of data from 31 of the studies. Overall, effects of reindeer on species richness of vascular plants depended on temperature, ranging from negative at low temperature to positive at high temperature. Effects on forbs, graminoids, woody species, and bryophytes were weak or non-significant, whereas the effect on lichens was negative. However, many individual studies showed clear positive or negative effects, but the available information was insufficient to explain this context dependence. Conclusions: We see two pressing matters emerging from our study. First, there is a lack of research with which to build a circumpolar understanding of grazing effects, which calls for more studies using a common protocol to quantify reindeer impacts. Secondly, the highly context-dependent outcomes suggest that research and management have to consider local conditions. For instance, predictions of what a management decision would mean for the effects of reindeer on vegetation will have to take the variation of vegetation types and dominant growth forms, productivity, and grazing history into account. Policy and management have to go hand-in-hand with research in individual cases if the dynamics between plants, animals, and humans are to be sufficiently understood.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/4</link>                 <dc:creator>Claes Bernes</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Kari Br\\ufffd\\ufffdthen</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Bruce Forbes</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>James Speed</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jon Moen</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:4</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-02-23T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/s13750-014-0030-3</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/s13750-014-0030-3-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>4</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-02-23T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/4\">         <title>Systematic review of effects on biodiversity from oil palm production</title>         <description>Background: During the past decade there has been a growing interest in bioenergy, driven by concerns about global climate change, growing energy demand, and depleting fossil fuel reserves. The predicted rise in biofuel demand makes it important to understand the potential consequences of expanding biofuel cultivation.A systematic review was conducted on the biodiversity impacts of three first-generation biofuel crops (oil palm, soybean, and jatropha) in the tropics. The study focused on the impacts on species richness, abundance (total number of individuals or occurrences), community composition, and ecosystem functions related to species richness and community composition. Methods: Literature was searched using an a priori protocol. Owing to a lack of available studies of biodiversity impacts from soybean and jatropha that met the inclusion criteria set out in the systematic review protocol, all analyses focused on oil palm. The impacts of oil palm cultivation on species richness, abundance, and community similarity were summarized quantitatively; other results were summarized narratively. Results: The searches returned 9143 articles after duplicate removal of which 25 met the published inclusion criteria and were therefore accepted for the final review. Twenty of them had been conducted in Malaysia and two thirds were on arthropods.Overall, oil palm plantations had reduced species richness compared with primary and secondary forests, and the composition of species assemblages changed significantly after forest conversion to oil palm plantation. Abundance showed species-specific responses and hence, the overall abundance was not significantly different between plantations and forest areas. Only one study reported how different production systems (smallholdings vs. industrial estates) affect biodiversity. No studies that examined the effects on ecosystem functions of reduced species richness or changes in community composition met the inclusion criteria. Neither were there studies that reported how areas managed under different standards (e.g. different certification systems) affect biodiversity and ecosystem function. Conclusions: Our review suggests that oil palm plantations have reduced species richness compared with primary and secondary forests, and the composition of species assemblage changes significantly after forest conversion to oil palm plantation. Effects of different production systems on biodiversity and ecosystem function are clear knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research.Trial registrationCEE10-013</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/3/1/4</link>                 <dc:creator>Sini Savilaakso</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Claude Garcia</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>John Garcia-Ulloa</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jaboury Ghazoul</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Martha Groom</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Manuel Guariguata</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Yves Laumonier</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Robert Nasi</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Gillian Petrokofsky</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jake Snaddon</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Michal Zrust</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2014, null:4</dc:source>         <dc:date>2014-02-25T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-3-4</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-3-4-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>4</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2014-02-25T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/3\">         <title>What is the effect of phasing out long-chain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on the concentrations of perfluoroalkyl acids and their precursors in the environment? A systematic review protocol</title>         <description>Background: There is a growing concern in Sweden and elsewhere that continued emissions of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may cause environmental as well as human health effects. PFASs are a broad class of man-made substances that have been produced and used in both commercial products and industrial processes for more than 60&#160;years. Although the production and use of some PFASs has been phased-out in some parts of the world, it is not known what effect these actions to date have had on PFAS concentrations in the environment. Owing to the wide diversity of PFASs, it is difficult to generalize their properties, environmental fate and production histories. However, the strength and stability of the C-F bond renders the perfluoroalkyl moieties resistant to heat and environmental degradation. Several PFASs are now occurring even in very remote areas in large parts of the world, but the environmental transport and fate of substances within this group is not well understood. A systematic review may be able to determine whether the concentrations of these substances in different environments are changing in any particular direction with time, and whether the phase-outs have had any effects on the concentration trends. Methods: Searches for primary research studies reporting on temporal variations of PFAS concentrations in the environment will be performed in the scientific literature as well as in other reports. Relevant samples include both abiotic and biological samples including humans. No particular time, document type, language or geographical constraints will be applied. Two authors will screen all retrieved articles. Double screening of about 10% of the articles will be performed by all authors at both title/abstract and full-text levels. Kappa tests will be used to test if the screening is consistent. Relevant articles will be critically appraised by four authors (double checking of 25% of the articles). Quality assessment will focus on selection bias, dating of samples, sample integrity and analytical procedures. Data synthesis will be based on statistical analysis of temporal concentration trends.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/3</link>                 <dc:creator>Magnus Land</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Cynthia de Wit</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Ian Cousins</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Dorte Herzke</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jana Johansson</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Jonathan Martin</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:3</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-27T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-4-3</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-4-3-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>3</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-27T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/2\">         <title>What are `Integrated Landscape Approaches&#191; and how effectively have they been implemented in the tropics: a systematic map protocol</title>         <description>Background: There is an increasing acceptance that sectorial approaches to land management are no longer sufficient to meet global challenges such as poverty alleviation, biodiversity conservation, and food production. The pressing challenge of integrated landscape management is to link agricultural practices, institutions and policies with other landscape-scale activities. &#8220;Integrated Landscape Approaches&#8221; provide a basic framework for balancing competing demands and integrating policies for multiple land uses within a given area. However, attempts to formalize and characterize what landscape approaches actually represent have resulted in a plethora of interlinked terminology and re-invention of ideas and practices under multiple guises. This has led to delayed uptake amongst policy makers and resistance to implementation on the ground. This protocol will describe the methodology to be employed for a systematic map that will chart the development of the landscape approach theory, consolidate and synthesize existing definitions, and identify where and how these approaches have been implemented in the humid and dry tropics.Methods/DesignA scoping exercise gave rise to a selection of search terms appropriate to the research question which will then be applied to a suite of specialist, online and institutional databases. The protocol will follow a population-intervention-comparator-outcome (P.I.C.O) framework which provides the basic rationale for evidence-based systematic literature searches. The P.I.C.O serves as the inclusion criteria and together with a pre-determined exclusion criteria will be used to screen retrieved literature for relevance at title, abstract and full text levels. All studies investigating either landscape approach theory or implementation within the humid and dry tropics will be included. The resulting studies will be coded and used to satisfy two key outcomes. First, literature on the theory of landscape-scale approaches will be compared and contrasted to identify where overlap and disjuncture exists. Second, studies of landscape approach implementation will be assessed for effectiveness, geographically mapped, made available in searchable databases and supplemented with a full report.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/4/1/2</link>                 <dc:creator>James Reed</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Liz Deakin</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Terry Sunderland</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2015, null:2</dc:source>         <dc:date>2015-01-07T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-4-2</dc:identifier>                                 <prism:require>/content/figures/2047-2382-4-2-toc.gif</prism:require>                 <prism:publicationName>Environmental Evidence</prism:publicationName>         <prism:issn>2047-2382</prism:issn>         <prism:volume>${item.volume}</prism:volume>         <prism:startingPage>2</prism:startingPage>         <prism:publicationDate>2015-01-07T00:00:00Z</prism:publicationDate>                 <prism:versionidentifier>XML</prism:versionidentifier>                 <cc:license rdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/\" />     </item>         <item rdf:about=\"http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/1/1/4\">         <title>The effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe - A Systematic Map.</title>         <description>Background: Agriculture is the dominant land use throughout much of Europe. Changes to farming practices have led to concerns about negative impacts on biodiversity, and current agricultural policy has an emphasis towards conservation. The objective of this study was to investigate and describe the nature and coverage of research pertaining to the effectiveness of integrated farm management, organic farming and agri-environment schemes as interventions for conserving biodiversity in temperate Europe.Systematic mapping methodology was adapted from social sciences, and used to create a searchable database of relevant research. Methods: Searches were made of 10 electronic databases containing peer reviewed journals, PhD theses, conference proceedings and organisational reports. Web searches for relevant research were also made. The title and abstracts of results were examined for relevance. Studies were included when published in English, when an intervention was applied to increase biodiversity or species diversity on farmland, and where there was a measured effect on study organism(s). Correlative and manipulative studies from temperate Europe were included. The research was incorporated into a searchable database (systematic map) and key wording used to describe, categorise and code studies. Results: The searches identified 83,590 records. Following removal of duplicates and the application of inclusion criteria, 743 references were coded for the final systematic map database. Most of the studies reported were from Western Europe, particularly from the UK. Invertebrates were the most commonly studied organism followed by plants and birds, and field margins were the most commonly studied biotope. Conclusions: The systematic map describes the scope of research on the topic. It can be used to inform future primary research, or research synthesis and evaluation methods such as systematic review. Areas for which there appear to be evidence gaps, and so may have potential for further primary research, are highlighted. They include the effectiveness of agri-environment options under different farming systems and in providing for amphibians and reptiles. Implications for the development of future systematic maps are discussed, including the question of how to incorporate study quality appraisal. The development of a Collaboration for Environmental Evidence systematic mapping methods group will address some of these issues.</description>         <link>http://www.environmentalevidencejournal.org/content/1/1/4</link>                 <dc:creator>Nicola Randall</dc:creator>                 <dc:creator>Katy James</dc:creator>                 <dc:source>Environmental Evidence 2012, null:4</dc:source>         <dc:date>2012-05-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>         <dc:identifier>doi:10.1186/2047-2382-1-4</dc:identifier>                             <dc:title>Changes in agricultural practices in Europe explored</dc:title>                             <dc:description>A systematic map to identify the scope of research published addressing conservation issues surrounding changes in agricultural practices in Europe.
