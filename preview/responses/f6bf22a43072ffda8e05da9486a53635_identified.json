AutoDock Vina was performed to reduce the duration of MD simulation as it determines favored binding sites. With the found binding sites, MD simulation was performed on Gromacs to evaluate the effect of ER on the conformation of amyloid beta proteins. The result showed that interaction between the protein and ER increased, proven by high binding affinity between two molecules. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Koo, Doyeon</dc:creator> <dc:description>Based on the previous studies of drug development to resolve the amyloid plaque formation in Alzheimer's Disease, supporting molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was designed to investigate the mechanism of drug candidate molecule, Erythrosine B.

However, we are still years away from any possible cure for cancer, and available treatments have many obstacles to overcome. Specifically, chemotherapy has significant issues in delivering the required dosage of drugs to the cancer site. One of the disadvantages is that large amounts of drugs are required to be injected in order to overcome various obstacles including the circulatory system. However, due to toxicity, there is a limitation on the administered dosage allowed. To solve this problem, smart drug delivery systems have been developed. Encapsulating chemotherapy drugs inside synthesized carriers such as liposomes can reduce toxicity by shielding the drug from contacting healthy cells. One of the goals is to create a type of release mechanism at the cancer site. Releasing a chemotherapy drug at a specific site will make it possible to deliver appropriate doses of drugs without causing high toxicity. To study how carriers act inside the body, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation can be incorporated. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Choi, Jae Hyung</dc:creator> <dc:description>For most of the pharmaceutical industry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds existence, there have been many efforts to develop a cure for treating cancer.

MSI can simultaneously measure hundreds to thousands of molecules, and link those molecular profiles with their spatial location in the sample. However, MSI datasets can be very large, and identifying potentially important biological patterns is a challenging problem. Many types of explorative data analysis have been applied to MSI datasets, and in particular, k-means clustering has recently gained attention for this application. In this study, we examine the effects of different parameters on the performance of basic k-means and fuzzy k-means clustering in identifying biologically relevant patterns in MSI datasets. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Sarkari, Sanaiya</dc:creator> <dc:description>Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an experimental technique used to measure molecular composition across the surface of a sample, such as a tissue slice.

CSCs are resistant to  many current cancer treatments,  including chemo and radiation therapy.
