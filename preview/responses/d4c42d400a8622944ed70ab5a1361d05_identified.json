Janet M An experimental program was formulated to investigate the flexural behaviour of concrete prestressed with aramid fibre reinforced plastic tendons (AFRPs). The particular focus was the influence of the bond between an AFRP tendon and concrete on the flexural response of a beam.&#13; &#13; In the main test series pre-tensioned concrete beams were cast using either one of two types of AFRP tendons or steel tendons. The influence of bond was studied by testing beams with fully-bonded tendons, unbonded tendons or partially-bonded tendons. It was found that, although the fully-bonded beams had a high ultimate load capacity, only limited rotation occurred prior to failure. In contrast, large rotations were noted in the unbonded beams but the strengths of these members were significantly (25%) lower than those of the fully-bonded beams.  The only beams that achieved both a high rotation capacity and a high ultimate load capacity were the beams with partially-bonded tendons.&#13; &#13; It is suggested that the use of partially-bonded tendons could provide the basis of a new design method for concrete beams prestressed with FRPs.

Fibre reinforced plastics describes a group of materials composed of inorganic or organic fibres embedded in a resin matrix. frps are strong, non-magnetic, light-weight and for the most part, non-corrodable. There is great scope for the use of frps as concrete reinforcement and the high strength of the materials is conducive to prestressed applications. However, finding a suitable method of anchoring the tendons without inducing stress concentrations in the fibres has been identified as a problem. The current paper investigates the potential for the use of expansive cement couplers as a means of pretensioning frp tendons. An experimental study was carried out on couplers to join steel reinforcing bars and then extended to include the coupling of frp materials to steel prestress wire.

Beams prestressed with partially bonded fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) tendons have high strength and rotation capacity but cannot be modeled by conventional techniques. Herein, it is assumed that all deformation takes place at cracks between rigid bodies. By setting up appropriate compatibility and equilibrium equations, the behavior at a single crack can be modeled, which then allows predictions to be made as to which of four possible events will occur next. These lead either to beam failure, or to changes in the geometry that can be analyzed using the same techniques. Comparisons are made with test results, and reasonable agreement is shown.

Recent developments in the use of fibre-reinforced polymers (FRPs) in reinforced and prestressed concrete applications are reviewed. The influence of FRP material properties on the design of concrete structures is considered and applications are discussed in conjunction with the structural function of the FRP reinforcement. The review includes examples of the practical implementation of the technology and addresses important durability issues. A number of future considerations/research needs are identified and the requirement for the provision of standard, sustainable and cost-effective FRP solutions is highlighted. It is concluded that although there have been significant advances in our knowledge of the behaviour of FRP-concrete structures, the timeframe in which FRPs will no longer be considered as new materials remains ambiguous.
