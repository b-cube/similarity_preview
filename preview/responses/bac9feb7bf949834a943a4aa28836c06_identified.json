The role of this widespread PTM has yet to be fully elucidated, but can impact protein localization, interactions, activity, and stability. Here we present the first proteome-wide survey of lysine acetylation in cortical astrocytes, a subtype of glia that is a component of the blood-brain barrier and a key regulator of neuronal function and plasticity. We identified 529 lysine acetylation sites across 304 proteins found in multiple cellular compartments that largely function in RNA processing/transcription, metabolism, chromatin biology, and translation. Two hundred and seventy-seven of the acetylated lysines we identified on 186 proteins have not been reported previously in any other cell type. We also mapped an acetylome of astrocytes infected with the brain parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. It has been shown that infection with T. gondii modulates host cell gene expression, including several lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) and deacetylase (KDAC) genes, suggesting that the host acetylome may also be altered during infection. In the T. gondii-infected astrocytes, we identified 34 proteins exhibiting a level of acetylation &gt;2-fold and 24 with a level of acetylation &lt;2-fold relative to uninfected astrocytes. Our study documents the first acetylome map for cortical astrocytes, uncovers novel lysine acetylation sites, and demonstrates that T. gondii infection produces an altered acetylome. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T20:50:50Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: \"Transcriptomic resources for five shrimp (Crustacea: Atyidae and Alpheidae) species from the anchialine ecosystem\" in Genomic Resources Notes accepted 1 June 2014 to 31 July 2014</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.jn8t1\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.jn8t1</id> <updated>2015-03-18T20:33:12Z</updated> <published>2014-10-27T17:48:39Z</published> <dc:date>2014-10-27T17:48:39Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Having a lot of a good thing: multiple important group memberships as a source of self-esteem</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3h46r\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3h46r</id> <updated>2015-03-18T19:56:53Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T19:56:49Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Membership in important social groups can promote a positive identity. We propose and test an identity resource model in which personal self-esteem is boosted by membership in additional important social groups. Belonging to multiple important group memberships predicts personal self-esteem in children (Study 1a), older adults (Study 1b), and former residents of a homeless shelter (Study 1c). Study 2 shows that the effects of multiple important group memberships on personal self-esteem are not reducible to  number of interpersonal ties. Studies 3a and 3b provide longitudinal evidence that multiple important group memberships predict personal self-esteem over time. Studies 4 and 5 show that collective self-esteem mediates this effect, suggesting that membership in multiple important groups boosts personal self-esteem because people take pride in, and derive meaning from, important group memberships. Discussion focuses on when and why important group memberships act as a social resource that fuels personal self-esteem. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T19:56:49Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Impacts of degraded DNA on restriction enzyme associated DNA sequencing (RADSeq)</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.mf1ck\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.mf1ck</id> <updated>2015-03-18T18:28:09Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T17:46:04Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Degraded DNA from suboptimal field sampling is common in molecular ecology. However, its impact on techniques that use restriction site associated next-generation DNA sequencing (RADSeq, GBS) is unknown. We experimentally examined the effects of in situ DNA degradation on data generation for a modified double digest RADSeq approach (3RAD). We generated libraries using genomic DNA serially extracted from the muscle tissue of 8 individual Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) following 0, 12, 48, and 96 hours incubation at room temperature post-euthanasia. This treatment of the tissue resulted in input DNA that ranged in quality from nearly intact to highly sheared. All samples were sequenced as a multiplexed pool on an Illumina MiSeq. Libraries created from low to moderately degraded DNA (12 to 48 hours) performed well. In contrast, the number of RADtags per individual, number of variable sites, and percentage of identical RADtags retained were all dramatically reduced when libraries were made using highly degraded DNA (96 hour group). This reduction in performance was largely due to a significant and unexpected loss of raw reads as a result of poor quality scores. Our findings remained consistent after changes in restriction enzymes, modified fold-coverage values (2 to 16-fold), and additional read-length trimming. We conclude that starting DNA quality is an important consideration for RADSeq; however, the approach remains robust until genomic DNA is extensively degraded. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T17:46:04Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Spermatozoa scattering by a microchannel feature: an elastohydrodynamic model</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4767b\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4767b</id> <updated>2015-03-18T18:15:15Z</updated> <published>2015-02-16T19:31:03Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Sperm traverse their microenvironment through viscous fluid by propagating flagellar waves; the waveform emerges as a consequence of elastic structure, internal active moments and low Reynolds number fluid dynamics. Engineered microchannels have recently been proposed as a method of sorting and manipulating motile cells; the interaction of cells with these artificial environments therefore warrants investigation. A numerical method is presented for large-amplitude elastohydrodynamic interaction of active swimmers with domain features. This method is employed to examine hydrodynamic scattering by a model microchannel backstep feature. Scattering is shown to depend on backstep height and the relative strength of viscous and elastic forces in the flagellum. In a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhigh viscosity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd parameter regime corresponding to human sperm in cervical mucus analogue, this hydrodynamic contribution to scattering is comparable in magnitude to recent data on contact effects, being of the order of 5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd10\\ufffd\\ufffd. Scattering can be positive or negative depending on the relative strength of viscous and elastic effects, emphasizing the importance of viscosity on the interaction of sperm with their microenvironment. The modulation of scattering angle by viscosity is associated with variations in flagellar asymmetry induced by the elastohydrodynamic interaction with the boundary feature. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-16T19:31:03Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: New insights for Drosophila GAGA factor in larvae</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.kp328\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.kp328</id> <updated>2015-03-18T18:00:40Z</updated> <published>2015-02-16T17:07:45Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">GAGA factor plays important roles during Drosophila embryogenesis and its maternal contribution is essential for early development. Here, the role of GAGA factor was studied in 3rd instar larvae using depletion and overexpression conditions in wing disc and transcriptome analysis. We found that genes changing expression were different to those previously described using GAGA mutants in embryos. No apparent phenotypes on GAGA depletion could usually be observed at larval stages in imaginal discs but a strong effect on salivary gland polytene chromosomes was observed. In the adult, GAGA depletion produced many defects like abnormal cell proliferation in the wing, impaired dorsal closure and resulted in homeotic transformation of abdominal segment A5. Unexpectedly, no effects on Ultrabithorax expression were observed. Short overexpression of GAGA factor in 3rd instar larvae also resulted in activation of a set of genes not previously described to be under GAGA regulation, and in lethality at pupa. Our results suggest a little contribution of GAGA factor on gene transcription in wing discs and a change of the genes regulated in comparison with embryo. GAGA factor activity thus correlates with the global changes in gene expression that take place at the embryo-to-larva and, later, at the larva-to-pupa transitions. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-16T17:07:45Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Can differential nutrient extraction explain property variations in a predatory trap?</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.t01q1\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.t01q1</id> <updated>2015-03-18T17:52:37Z</updated> <published>2015-02-27T21:28:21Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Predators exhibit flexible foraging to facilitate taking prey that offer important nutrients. Because trap-building predators have limited control over the prey they encounter, differential nutrient extraction and trap architectural flexibility may be used as a means of prey selection. Here, we tested whether differential nutrient extraction induces flexibility in architecture and stickiness of a spider's web by feeding Nephila pilipes live crickets (CC), live flies (FF), dead crickets with the web stimulated by flies (CD) or dead flies with the web stimulated by crickets (FD). Spiders in the CD group consumed less protein per mass of lipid or carbohydrate, and spiders in the FF group consumed less carbohydrates per mass of protein. Spiders from the CD group built stickier webs that used less silk, whereas spiders in the FF group built webs with more radii, greater catching areas and more silk, compared with other treatments. Our results suggest that differential nutrient extraction is a likely explanation for prey-induced spider web architecture and stickiness variations. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-27T21:28:21Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: What makes eyespots intimidating? - the importance of pairedness</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.390t3\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.390t3</id> <updated>2015-03-18T17:49:02Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T17:48:58Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Background: Many butterflies possess striking structures called eyespots on their wings, and several studies have sought to understand the selective forces that have shaped their evolution. Work over the last decade has shown that a major function of eyespots is their ability to reduce predation by being intimidating to attacking predators. Two competing hypotheses seek to explain the cause of intimidation, one suggesting \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeye-mimicry\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and the other their \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdconspicuousness\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd as the reason. There is an on-going debate about which of these better explains the effectiveness of eyespots against predation. We undertook a series of indoor experiments to understand the relative importance of conspicuousness and eye-mimicry, and therefore how predator perception may have influenced the evolution of eyespots. We conducted choice tests where artificial paper models mimicking Junonia almana butterflies were presented to chickens and their preference of attack recorded. Results: We first established that birds avoided models with a pair of eyespots. However, contrary to previous, outdoor experiments, we found that the total area of eyespots did not affect their effectiveness. Non-eye-like, fan shaped patterns derived from eyespots were found to be just as effective as eye-like circular patterns. Furthermore, we did not find a significant effect of symmetry of patterns, again in discordance with previous work. However, across all experiments, models with a pair of patterns, symmetric or asymmetric, eyelike or non-eye-like, suffered from fewer attacks compared with other models. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of pairedness of eyespots, and supports the hypothesis that two is a biologically significant number that is important in prey\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpredator signalling. We discuss the implications of our results for the understanding of eyespot evolution. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T17:48:58Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Global biogeography and evolution of Cuvierina pteropods</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.7n1q4\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.7n1q4</id> <updated>2015-03-18T17:24:10Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T17:24:07Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Background: Shelled pteropods are planktonic gastropods that are potentially good indicators of the effects of ocean acidification. They also have high potential for the study of zooplankton evolution because they are metazoan plankton with a good fossil record. We investigated phenotypic and genetic variation in pteropods belonging to the genus Cuvierina in relation to their biogeographic distribution across the world\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds oceans. We aimed to assess species boundaries and to reconstruct their evolutionary history. Results: We distinguished six morphotypes based on geometric morphometric analyses of shells from 926 museum and 113 fresh specimens. These morphotypes have distinct geographic distributions across the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans, and belong to three major genetic clades based on COI and 28S DNA sequence data. Using a fossil-calibrated phylogeny, we estimated that these clades separated in the Late Oligocene and Early to Middle Miocene. We found evidence for ecological differentiation among all morphotypes based on ecological niche modelling with sea surface temperature, salinity and phytoplankton biomass as primary determinants. Across all analyses, we found highly congruent patterns of differentiation suggesting species level divergences between morphotypes. However, we also found distinct morphotypes (e.g. in the Atlantic Ocean) that were ecologically, but not genetically differentiated. Conclusions: Given the distinct ecological and phenotypic specializations found among both described and undescribed Cuvierina taxa, they may not respond equally to future ocean changes and may not be equally sensitive to ocean acidification. Our findings support the view that ecological differentiation may be an important driving force in the speciation of zooplankton. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T17:24:07Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Enhanced diversity and aflatoxigenicity in interspecific hybrids of Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.1pj04\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.1pj04</id> <updated>2015-03-18T17:01:23Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T17:01:19Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are the two most important aflatoxin-producing fungi responsible for the contamination of agricultural commodities worldwide. Both species are heterothallic and undergo sexual reproduction in laboratory crosses. Here we examine the possibility of interspecific matings between A. flavus and A. parasiticus. These species can be distinguished morphologically and genetically, as well as by their mycotoxin profiles. Aspergillus flavus produces both B aflatoxins and cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), B aflatoxins or CPA alone, or neither mycotoxin; Aspergillus parasiticus produces B and G aflatoxins or the aflatoxin precursor O-methylsterigmatocystin, but not CPA. Only four out of forty-five attempted interspecific crosses between opposite mating types of A. flavus and A. parasiticus were fertile and produced viable ascospores. Single ascospore strains from each cross were isolated and shown to be recombinant hybrids using multilocus genotyping and array comparative genome hybridization. Conidia of parents and their hybrid progeny were haploid and predominantly monokaryons and dikaryons based on flow cytometry. Multilocus phylogenetic inference showed that experimental hybrid progeny were grouped with naturally occurring A. flavus L strain and A. parasiticus. Higher total aflatoxin concentrations in some F1 progeny strains compared to midpoint parent aflatoxin levels indicate synergism in aflatoxin production; moreover, three progeny strains synthesized G aflatoxins that were not produced by the parents, and there was evidence of allopolyploidization in one strain. These results suggest that hybridization is an important diversifying force resulting in the genesis of novel toxin profiles in these agriculturally important fungi. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T17:01:19Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Feces production as a form of social immunity in an insect with facultative maternal care</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.9p31r\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.9p31r</id> <updated>2015-03-18T15:32:31Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T15:32:27Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Background: Social animals have the unique capability of mounting social defenses against pathogens. Over the last decades, social immunity has been extensively studied in species with obligatory and permanent forms of social life. However, its occurrence in less derived social systems and thus its role in the early evolution of group-living remains unclear. Here, we investigated whether lining nests with feces is a form of social immunity against microbial growth in the European earwig Forficula auricularia, an insect with temporary family life and facultative maternal care. Results: Using a total of 415 inhibition zone assays, we showed that earwig feces inhibit the growth of two GRAM+ bacteria, two fungi, but not of a GRAM- bacteria. These inhibitions did not result from the consumed food or the nesting environment. We then demonstrated that the antimicrobial activity against fungus was higher in offspring than maternal feces, but that this difference was absent against bacteria. Finally, we showed that family interactions inhibited the antibacterial activity of maternal frass against one of the two GRAM+ bacteria, whereas they had no effect on the one of nymphal frass. By contrast, antifungal activities of the frass were independent of mother-offspring interactions. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that social immunity occurs in a species with simple and facultative social life, and thus shed light on the general importance of this process in the evolution of group-living. These results also emphasize that defecation can be under selection for other life-history traits than simple waste disposal. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T15:32:27Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Parasitism overrides herbivore identity allowing hyperparasitoids to locate their parasitoid host by using herbivore-induced plant volatiles</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.d3k37\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.d3k37</id> <updated>2015-03-18T14:57:34Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T14:57:31Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Foraging success of predators profoundly depends on reliable and detectable cues indicating the presence of their often inconspicuous prey. Carnivorous insects rely on chemical cues to optimize foraging efficiency. Hyperparasitoids that lay their eggs in the larvae or pupae of parasitic wasps may find their parasitoid hosts developing in different herbivores. They can use herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) to locate parasitized caterpillars. Because different herbivore species induce different HIPV emission from plants, hyperparasitoids may have to deal with large variation in volatile information that indicates host presence. In the current study, we used an ecogenomics approach to first address whether parasitized caterpillars of two herbivore species (Pieris rapae and P. brassicae) induce similar transcriptional and metabolomic responses in wild Brassica oleracea plants; and second, whether hyperparasitoids Lysibia nana are able to discriminate between these induced plant responses to locate their parasitoid host in different herbivores under both laboratory and field conditions. Our study revealed that both herbivore identity and parasitism affect plant transcriptional and metabolic responses to herbivory. We also found that hyperparasitoids are able to respond to HIPVs released by wild B. oleracea under both laboratory and field conditions. In addition, we observed stronger attraction of hyperparasitoids to HIPVs when plants were infested with parasitized caterpillars. However, hyperparasitoids were equally attracted to plants infested by either herbivore species. Our results indicate that parasitism plays a major role in HIPV-mediated plant-hyperparasitoid interactions. Furthermore, these findings also indicate that plant trait-mediated indirect interaction networks play important roles in community-wide species interactions. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T14:57:31Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Seasonal diversity and dynamics of haptophytes in the Skagerrak, Norway, explored by high-throughput sequencing</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.b8d21\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.b8d21</id> <updated>2015-03-18T14:44:17Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T14:44:14Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Microalgae in the division Haptophyta play key roles in the marine ecosystem and in global biogeochemical processes. Despite their ecological importance, knowledge on seasonal dynamics, community composition and abundance at the species level is limited due to their small cell size and few morphological features visible under the light microscope. Here we present unique data on haptophyte seasonal diversity and dynamics from two annual cycles, with the taxonomic resolution and sampling depth obtained with high-throughput sequencing. From outer Oslofjorden, S Norway, nano- and picoplanktonic samples were collected monthly for two years, and the haptophytes targeted by amplification of RNA/cDNA with Haptophyta-specific 18S rDNA V4 primers. We obtained 156 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), from c. 400.000 454 pyrosequencing reads, after rigorous bioinformatic filtering and clustering at 99.5%. Most OTUs represented uncultured and/or not yet 18S rDNA-sequenced species. Haptophyte OTU richness and community composition exhibited high temporal variation and significant yearly periodicity. Richness was highest in September-October (autumn) and lowest in April-May (spring). Some taxa were detected all year, such as Chrysochromulina simplex, Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis cordata, whereas most calcifying coccolithophores only appeared from summer to early winter. We also revealed the seasonal dynamics of OTUs representing putative novel classes (clades HAP-2 - 5) or orders (Clade D, E, F). Season, light and temperature accounted for 29% of the variation in OTU composition. Residual variation may be related to biotic factors, such as competition and virus. This study provides new, in-depth knowledge on seasonal diversity and dynamics of haptophytes in North Atlantic coastal waters. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T14:44:14Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Inferring the demographic history of Drosophila subobscura from nucleotide variation at regions not affected by chromosomal inversions</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.j126v\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.j126v</id> <updated>2015-03-18T20:03:53Z</updated> <published>2015-03-18T14:30:40Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Drosophila subobscura presents a rich and complex chromosomal inversion polymorphism. It can thus be considered a model system i) to study the mechanisms originating inversions and how inversions affect the levels and patterns of variation in the inverted regions, and ii) to study adaptation at both the single-gene and chromosomal inversion levels. It is therefore important to infer its demographic history since previous information indicated that its nucleotide variation is not at mutation-drift equilibrium. For that purpose, we sequenced 16 non-coding regions distributed across those parts of the J chromosome not affected by inversions in the studied population and possibly either by other selective events. The pattern of variation detected in these 16 regions is similar to that previously reported within different chromosomal arrangements, suggesting that the latter results would, thus, mainly reflect recent demographic events rather than the partial selective sweep imposed by the origin and frequency increase of inversions. Among the simple demographic models considered in our ABC analysis of variation at the 16 regions, the model best supported by the data implies a population size expansion soon after the penultimate glacial period. This model constitutes a better null model and it is therefore an important resource for subsequent studies aiming among others to uncover selective events across the species genome. Our results also highlight the importance of introducing the possibility of multiple hits in the coalescent simulations with an outgroup. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-18T14:30:40Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Transgenerational effects of sexual interactions and sexual conflict: non-sires boost the fecundity of females in the following generation</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.p9h8g\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.p9h8g</id> <updated>2015-03-18T13:42:45Z</updated> <published>2015-02-25T18:18:20Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The consequences of sexual interactions extend beyond the simple production of offspring. These interactions typically entail direct effects on female fitness, but may also impact the life histories of later generations. Evaluating the cross-generational effects of sexual interactions provides insights into the dynamics of sexual selection and conflict. Such studies can elucidate whether offspring fitness optima diverge across sexes upon heightened levels of sexual interaction among parents. Here, we found that, in Drosophila melanogaster, components of reproductive success in females, but not males, were contingent on the nature of sexual interactions experienced by their mothers. In particular, maternal sexual interactions with non-sires enhanced female fecundity in the following generation. This highlights the importance of non-sire influences of sexual interactions on the expression of offspring life histories. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-25T18:18:20Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Plasmodium infection brings forward mosquito oviposition</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q8292\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.q8292</id> <updated>2015-03-18T13:35:55Z</updated> <published>2015-01-22T15:07:57Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Invertebrate hosts often bring forward their reproductive effort in response to a parasitic infection. This is widely interpreted as a host-driven response aimed at compensating for the expected losses in future fitness as a result of parasitism. Here we report that mosquitoes bring forward their oviposition schedule when they are infected with Plasmodium, a parasite known to severely curtail mosquito fecundity. This response could aim at compensating for a negative time-dependent effect of the parasite on mosquito fitness, as infected mosquitoes seem to display a strong and progressive decrease in the quality of the eggs they lay. In addition, we show that this shift in oviposition date is dependent on mosquito strain: a comparison of several isogenic mosquitoes strains, one insecticide-susceptible and two insecticide-resistant ones, reveals that only the former shift their oviposition strategy when infected. This pattern suggests the existence of a costly host-driven response to parasitism, as insecticide-resistant mosquitoes have been shown to be in generally poorer condition. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-22T15:07:57Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Inferring species interactions in ecological communities: a comparison of methods at different levels of complexity</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.20cp7\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.20cp7</id> <updated>2015-03-17T20:55:10Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T20:55:06Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">1.Natural communities commonly contain many different species and functional groups, and multiple types of species interactions act simultaneously, such as competition, predation, commensalism, or mutualism. However, experimental and theoretical investigations have generally been limited by focusing on one type of interaction at a time or by a lack of a common methodological and conceptual approach to measure species interactions.&#13; 2.We compared four methods to measure and express species interactions. These approaches are, with increasing degree of model complexity, an extinctionbased model, a relative-yield model, and two generalized Lotka-Volterra (LV) models. All four approaches have been individually applied in different fields of community ecology, but rarely integrated. We provide an overview of the definitions, assumptions and data needed for the specific methods, and apply them to empirical data by experimentally deriving the interaction matrices among 11 protist and rotifer species, belonging to three functional groups. Furthermore, we compare their advantages and limitations to predict multispeciescommunity dynamics and ecosystem functioning.&#13; 3.The relative-yield method is, in terms of final biomass production, the best method in predicting the 11-species community dynamics from the pairwise competition experiments. The LV model, which is considering equilibrium among the species, suffers from experimental constraints given the strict equilibrium assumption, and this may be rarely satisfied in ecological communities.&#13; 4.We show how simulations of a LV stochastic community model, derived from an empirical interaction matrix, can be used to predict multi-species community dynamics across multiple functional groups.&#13; 5.Our work unites available tools to measure species-interactions under one framework. This improves our ability to make management oriented predictions of species coexistence/extinction and to compare ecosystem processes across study systems. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T20:55:06Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Contemporary evolution during invasion: evidence for differentiation, natural selection, and local adaptation</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.gt678\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.gt678</id> <updated>2015-03-17T19:54:04Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T19:54:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Biological invasions are \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnatural\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experiments that can improve our understanding of contemporary evolution. We evaluate evidence for population differentiation, natural selection and adaptive evolution of invading plants and animals at two nested spatial scales: (i) among introduced populations (ii) between native and introduced genotypes. Evolution during invasion is frequently identified, but rarely confirmed as adaptive. In common garden studies, quantitative trait differentiation among populations is only marginally lower (~3.5%) among introduced relative to native populations, despite genetic bottlenecks and shorter timescales (i.e. millennia vs. decades). However, differentiation between genotypes from the native vs. introduced range is less clear and confounded by non-random geographic sampling; simulations suggest this can cause a high false positive discovery rate (&gt;50%) in geographically structured populations. Selection differentials (|s|) are stronger in introduced than in native species, although selection gradients (|\\ufffd\\ufffd|) are not, consistent with introduced species experiencing weaker genetic constraints. This could facilitate rapid adaptation, but evidence is limited. For example, rapid phenotypic evolution often manifests as geographical clines, but simulations demonstrate that non-adaptive trait clines can evolve frequently during colonization (~2/3 of simulations). Additionally, QST-FST studies may often misrepresent the strength and form of natural selection acting during invasion. Instead, classic approaches in evolutionary ecology (e.g. selection analysis, reciprocal transplant, artificial selection) are necessary to determine the frequency of adaptive evolution during invasion and its influence on establishment, spread and impact of invasive species. These studies are rare but crucial for managing biological invasions in the context of global change. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T19:54:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Polymorphism at the Clock gene predicts phenology of long-distance migration in birds</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.j22j1\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.j22j1</id> <updated>2015-03-18T19:51:58Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T19:40:06Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Dissecting phenotypic variance in life-history traits into its genetic and environmental components is at the focus of evolutionary studies and of pivotal importance to identify the mechanisms and predict the consequences of human-driven environmental change. The timing of recurrent life-history events (phenology) is under strong selection but the study of the genes that control potential environmental canalization in phenological traits is at its infancy. Candidate genes for circadian behavior entrained by photoperiod have been screened as potential controllers of phenological variation of breeding and molt in birds, with inconsistent results. Despite photoperiodic control of migration is well-established, no study has reported on migration phenology in relation to polymorphism at candidate genes in birds. We analyzed variation in spring migration dates within four trans-Saharan migratory species (Luscinia megarhynchos; Ficedula hypoleuca; Anthus trivialis; Saxicola rubetra) at a Mediterranean island in relation to Clock and Adcyap1 polymorphism. Individuals with larger number of glutamine residues in the poly-Q region of Clock gene migrated significantly later in one or, respectively, two species depending on sex and whether the within-individual mean length or the length of the longer Clock allele were considered. The results hinted at dominance of the longer Clock allele. No significant evidence for migration date to covary with Adcyap1 polymorphism emerged. This is the first evidence that migration phenology is associated with Clock in birds. This finding is important for evolutionary studies of migration and sheds light on the mechanisms that drive bird phenological changes and population trends in response to climate change. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T19:40:06Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Genetically distinct populations of northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis, in the North Atlantic: adaptation to different temperatures as an isolation factor</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.088qv\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.088qv</id> <updated>2015-03-18T19:45:20Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T19:24:43Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The large-scale population genetic structure of northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis, was investigated over the species's range in the North Atlantic, identifying multiple genetically distinct groups. Genetic divergence among sample localities varied among 10 microsatellite loci (range: FST = -0.0002 to 0.0475) with a highly significant average (FST = 0.0149; P &lt; 0.0001). In contrast, little or no genetic differences were observed among temporal replicates from the same localities (FST = 0.0004; P = 0.33). Spatial genetic patterns were compared to geographic distance, patterns of larval drift obtained through oceanographic modeling, and temperature differences, within a multiple linear regression framework. The best-fit model included all three factors and explained approximately 29% of all spatial genetic divergence. However, geographic distance and larval drift alone had only minor effects (2.5-4.7%) on large-scale genetic differentiation patterns, whereas bottom temperature differences explained most (26%). Larval drift was found to promote genetic homogeneity in parts of the study area with strong currents but appeared ineffective across large temperature gradients. These findings highlight the break-down of gene flow in a species with a long pelagic larval phase (up to three months), and indicate a role for local adaptation to temperature conditions in promoting evolutionary diversification and speciation in the marine environment. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T19:24:43Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Shared genetic diversity across the global invasive range of the Monk parakeet suggests a common restricted geographic origin and the possibility of convergent selection</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5pr61\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.5pr61</id> <updated>2015-03-17T19:04:16Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T19:04:12Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">While genetic diversity is hypothesized to be an important factor explaining invasion success, there is no consensus yet on how variation in source populations or demographic processes affect invasiveness. We used mtDNA and microsatellites to investigate genetic patterns and reconstruct the history of replicate invasions on three continents in a globally invasive bird, the monk parakeet (Myiopsitta monachus). We evaluated whether genetic diversity at invasive sites could be explained by (1) the native source populations from which they were derived, and (2) demographic bottlenecks during introduction. Genetic data indicated a localized source area for most sampled invasive populations, with limited evidence for admixing of native source populations. This pattern largely coincides with historical data on pet-trade exports. However, the invasive populations are genetically more similar than predicted from the export data alone. The extent of bottleneck effects varied among invasive populations. The low genetic diversity, evidence of demographic contraction and restricted source area observed do not support the hypothesis that invasion is favored by the mixing and recombining of genetic variation from multiple source populations. Instead, they suggest that reduced genetic variation through random processes may not inhibit successful establishment and invasion in this species. However, convergent selection across invasive sites could also explain the observed patterns of reduction and similarity in genetic variation and/or the restricted source area. In general, the alternative explanation of intraspecific variation in invasive potential among genotypes or geographic areas is neglected but warrants more attention as it could inform comparative studies and management of biological invaders. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T19:04:12Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: A priori and a posteriori approaches for finding genes of evolutionary interest in non-model species: osmoregulatory genes in the kidney transcriptome of the desert rodent Dipodomys spectabilis (banner-tailed kangaroo rat)</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sf654.2\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Marra, Nicholas J.</name> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sf654.2</id> <updated>2015-03-17T19:00:41Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T18:46:51Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">One common goal in evolutionary biology is the identification of genes underlying adaptive traits of evolutionary interest. Recently next-generation sequencing techniques have greatly facilitated such evolutionary studies in species otherwise depauperate of genomic resources. Kangaroo rats (Dipodomys sp.) serve as exemplars of adaptation in that they inhabit extremely arid environments, yet require no drinking water because of ultra-efficient kidney function and osmoregulation. As a basis for identifying water conservation genes in kangaroo rats, we conducted a priori bioinformatics searches in model rodents (Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus) to identify candidate genes with known or suspected osmoregulatory function. We then obtained 446,758 reads via 454 pyrosequencing to characterize genes expressed in the kidney of banner-tailed kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spectabilis). We also determined candidates a posteriori by identifying genes that were overexpressed in the kidney. The kangaroo rat sequences revealed nine different a priori candidate genes predicted from our Mus and Rattus searches, as well as 32 a posteriori candidate genes that were overexpressed in kidney. Mutations in two of these genes, Slc12a1 and Slc12a3, cause human renal diseases that result in the inability to concentrate urine. These genes are likely key determinants of physiological water conservation in desert rodents. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T18:46:51Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Patterns and drivers of intraspecific variation in avian life history along elevational gradients: a meta-analysis</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.h13vg\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.h13vg</id> <updated>2015-03-17T17:03:34Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T17:03:31Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Elevational gradients provide powerful natural systems for testing hypotheses regarding the role of environmental variation in the evolution of life-history strategies. Case studies have revealed shifts towards slower life histories in organisms living at high elevations yet no synthetic analyses exist of elevational variation in life-history traits for major vertebrate clades. We examined (i) how life-history traits change with elevation in paired populations of bird species worldwide, and (ii) which biotic and abiotic factors drive elevational shifts in life history. Using three analytical methods, we found that fecundity declined at higher elevations due to smaller clutches and fewer reproductive attempts per year. By contrast, elevational differences in traits associated with parental investment or survival varied among studies. High-elevation populations had shorter and later breeding seasons, but longer developmental periods implying that temporal constraints contribute to reduced fecundity. Analyses of clutch size data, the trait for which we had the largest number of population comparisons, indicated no evidence that phylogenetic history constrained species-level plasticity in trait variation associated with elevational gradients. The magnitude of elevational shifts in life-history traits were largely unrelated to geographic (altitude, latitude), intrinsic (body mass, migratory status), or habitat covariates. Meta-population structure, methodological issues associated with estimating survival, or processes shaping range boundaries could potentially explain the nature of elevational shifts in life-history traits evident in this data set. We identify a new risk factor for montane populations in changing climates: low fecundity will result in lower reproductive potential to recover from perturbations, especially as fewer than half of the species experienced higher survival at higher elevations. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T17:03:31Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Extinction debt of a common shrub in a fragmented landscape</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.cs5b4\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.cs5b4</id> <updated>2015-03-17T16:41:54Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T16:41:50Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">1. Environmental stochasticity and low demographic rates may cause delayed extinctions of habitat-specialist species that were initially retained within remnant patches after habitat loss and fragmentation. Detecting such extinction debts opens opportunities to counteract future biodiversity loss, yet knowing the underlying causes of population declines is a basic need for targeting specific guidelines for conservation and restoration (e.g. habitat quantity, quality, or connectivity).&#13; 2. Here, we examine the extinction debt in the common Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) occurring in woodland patches of a highly fragmented region that has lost nearly half of the remnant woodland cover during the last fifty years (1956\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2002).&#13; 3.

In order to test for extinction debt evidence, we tested whether myrtle occurrence is better predicted by past (1956) than by present (2002) woodland cover.&#13; 4. We found that the probability of myrtle occurrence is associated with present patch features (size and disturbance) that are linked to causes of individual mortality and/or recruitment collapse.

Individual longevity of the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis (myrtle) can delay local extinctions, but paying the debt is a matter of time, especially considering the elevated susceptibility of small and disturbed populations to environmental stochasticity. However, these populations still offer management opportunities and reducing disturbances and improving habitat quality, especially within small woodland patches, should be a top priority for conservation and restoration. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T16:41:50Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Do humans optimally exploit redundancy to control step variability in walking?</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sk55m\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.sk55m</id> <updated>2015-03-17T15:04:03Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T14:57:22Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">It is widely accepted that humans and animals minimize energetic cost while walking. While such principles predict average behavior, they do not explain the variability observed in walking. For robust performance, walking movements must adapt at each step, not just on average. Here, we propose an analytical framework that reconciles issues of optimality, redundancy, and stochasticity. For human treadmill walking, we defined a goal function to formulate a precise mathematical definition of one possible control strategy: maintain constant speed at each stride. We recorded stride times and stride lengths from healthy subjects walking at five speeds. The specified goal function yielded a decomposition of stride-to-stride variations into new gait variables explicitly related to achieving the hypothesized strategy. Subjects exhibited greatly decreased variability for goal-relevant gait fluctuations directly related to achieving this strategy, but far greater variability for goal-irrelevant fluctuations. More importantly, humans immediately corrected goal-relevant deviations at each successive stride, while allowing goal-irrelevant deviations to persist across multiple strides. To demonstrate that this was not the only strategy people could have used to successfully accomplish the task, we created three surrogate data sets. Each tested a specific alternative hypothesis that subjects used a different strategy that made no reference to the hypothesized goal function. Humans did not adopt any of these viable alternative strategies. Finally, we developed a sequence of stochastic control models of stride-to-stride variability for walking, based on the Minimum Intervention Principle. We demonstrate that healthy humans are not precisely \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdoptimal,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd but instead consistently slightly over-correct small deviations in walking speed at each stride. Our results reveal a new governing principle for regulating stride-to-stride fluctuations in human walking that acts independently of, but in parallel with, minimizing energetic cost. Thus, humans exploit task redundancies to achieve robust control while minimizing effort and allowing potentially beneficial motor variability. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T14:57:22Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Zoogeography of epigean freshwater Amphipoda (Crustacea) in Romania: fragmented distributions and wide altitudinal variability</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.fd8m9\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.fd8m9</id> <updated>2015-03-17T14:50:05Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T14:50:01Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Inland epigean freshwater amphipods of Romania are diverse and abundant for this region has a favourable geographical position between the Balkans and the Black Sea. Excluding Ponto-Caspian species originating in brackish waters and freshwater subterranean taxa, there are 11 formally recognized epigean freshwater species recorded from this country. They belong to 3 genera, each representing a different family: Gammarus (Gammaridae, 8 species or species complexes), Niphargus (Niphargidae, 2 epigean species) and Synurella (Crangonyctidae, one species). Their large-scale distribution patterns nevertheless remain obscure due to insufficient data, consequently limiting biogeographical interpretations. We provide extensive new data with high resolution distribution maps, thus improving the knowledge of the ranges of these taxa. Gammarus species display substantial altitudinal variability and patchy, fragmented distribution patterns. They occur abundantly, particularly in springs and streams, from lowlands to sub-mountainous and mountainous regions. In the light of recent molecular research, we hypothesize that the complex geomorphological dynamics of the Carpathian region during the Late Tertiary probably contributed to their allopatric distribution pattern. Contrasting with Gammarus, the genera Niphargus and Synurella exhibit low altitudinal variability, broad ecological valences and overlapping distributions, being widespread throughout the lowlands. The current distribution of N. hrabei and N. valachicus seems to be linked to the extent of the Paratethys during the Early Pliocene or Pleistocene. We further discuss the taxonomic validity of two synonymized and one apparently undescribed taxon, and provide an updated pictorial identification key that includes all taxa and forms discussed in our study. The mosaic distribution of epigean freshwater amphipod species in Romania shows that this region is particularly suitable for phylo- and biogeographical analyses of this group. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T14:50:01Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Genome-guided investigation of plant natural product biosynthesis</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.hs593\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.hs593</id> <updated>2015-03-17T17:15:11Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T14:42:16Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The medicinal plant Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (L.)

Access to a genome sequence would enable insights into the biochemistry, control, and evolution of genes responsible for MIA biosynthesis. However, generation of a near-complete, scaffolded genome is prohibitive to small research communities due to the expense, time, and expertise required. In this study, we generated a genome assembly for C. roseus which provides a near comprehensive representation of the genic space that revealed the genomic context of key points within the MIA biosynthetic pathway including physically clustered genes, tandem gene duplication, expression subfunctionalization, and putative neofunctionalization. The genome sequence also facilitated high resolution coexpression analyses that revealed three distinct clusters of co-expression within the components of the MIA pathway. Coordinated biosynthesis of precursors and intermediates throughout the pathway appear to be a feature of vinblastine/vincristine biosynthesis. The C. roseus genome also revealed localization of enzyme-rich genic regions and transporters near known biosynthetic enzymes, highlighting how even a draft genome sequence can empower the study of high-value specialized metabolites. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T14:42:16Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: The extent and consequences of p-hacking in science</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.79d43\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.79d43</id> <updated>2015-03-17T14:35:05Z</updated> <published>2015-03-17T14:35:01Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">A focus on novel, confirmatory, and statistically significant results leads to substantial bias in the scientific literature.

We applied network motif analysis to compare the structures of dominance networks from data published over the past 80 years. Overall patterns of dominance relations, including some aspects of non-interactions, were strikingly similar across disparate group types. For example, nearly all groups exhibited high frequencies of transitive triads, whereas cycles were very rare. Moreover, pass-along triads were rare, and double-dominant triads were common in most groups. These patterns did not vary in any systematic way across taxa, study settings (captive or wild) or group size. Two factors significantly affected network motif structure: the proportion of dyads that were observed to interact and the interaction rates of the top-ranked individuals. Thus, study design (i.e. how many interactions were observed) and the behaviour of key individuals in the group could explain much of the variations we see in social hierarchies across animals. Our findings confirm the ubiquity of dominance hierarchies across all animal systems, and demonstrate that network analysis provides new avenues for comparative analyses of social hierarchies. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-17T14:20:36Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: The impact of translocations on neutral and functional genetic diversity within and among populations of the Seychelles warbler</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.596k1\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.596k1</id> <updated>2015-03-17T06:30:07Z</updated> <published>2014-03-17T15:37:46Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Translocations are an increasingly common tool in conservation. The maintenance of genetic diversity through translocation is critical for both the short and long term persistence of populations and species. However, the relative spatio-temporal impacts of translocations on neutral and functional genetic diversity and how this affects genetic structure among the conserved populations overall has received little investigation. We compared the impact of translocating different numbers of founders on both microsatellite and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I diversity over a 23-year period in the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis). We found low and stable microsatellite and MHC diversity in the source population and evidence for only a limited loss of either type of diversity in the four new populations. However, we found evidence of significant, but low to moderate, genetic differentiation between populations with those populations established with fewer founders clustered separately. Stochastic genetic capture (as opposed to subsequent drift) was the main determinant of translocated population diversity. Further, a strong correlation between microsatellite and MHC differentiation suggested that neutral processes outweighed selection in shaping MHC diversity in the new populations. These data provide important insights into how to optimise the use of translocation as a conservation tool. </summary> <dc:date>2014-03-17T15:37:46Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Heterostyly promotes disassortative pollination and reduces sexual interference in Darwin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds primroses: evidence from experimental studies</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.mn6np\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.mn6np</id> <updated>2015-03-17T06:30:06Z</updated> <published>2014-03-17T22:22:22Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Different strategies to reduce selfing and promote outcrossing have evolved in hermaphroditic flowers. Heterostyly, a complex floral polymorphism that occurs in at least 27 families of angiosperms, is hypothesized to achieve both goals by optimizing cross-pollination (via disassortative pollen transfer) and restricting gamete wastage to autogamy (via the reduction of sexual interference between male and female organs). In heterostylous flowers, the reciprocal positioning of sexual organs in different morphs and the pollen incompatibility-system within flower or between flowers of the same morph are thought to optimize both male and female functions, reducing the conflicts inherent to the occurrence of both sexual organs in the same reproductive unit. Specific elements of the disassortative-pollination and sexual-interference hypotheses have been tested individually before. However, despite the long-standing interest in heterostyly \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd ever since Darwin's seminal work on primroses \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the predictions derived from these two hypotheses have never been experimentally and systematically examined in the same system. Using distylous primroses (Primula elatior, P. vulgaris) we compare pollen transfer (i) between reciprocal and non-reciprocal flowers; (ii) from anthers onto different parts of the pollinator's body; (iii) within flower and between flowers of the same morph. We further test whether (iv) anther-stigma distance correlates with self-pollen transfer; (v) seed-set differs after pollinations with compatible, incompatible, and both pollen types. Reciprocal herkogamy promotes differential placement of pollen onto different parts of the pollinator's body, thus effecting transfer of more pollen to reciprocal than non-reciprocal stigmas and realizing the key predictions of the disassortative-pollination hypothesis. However, short-styled flowers transfer pollen more disassortatively than long-styled flowers in both species, whereas long-styled flowers export more pollen to non-reciprocal than reciprocal stigmas in P. vulgaris, thus compromising male function in this species. Furthermore, larger distance between sexual organs lowers self- and intra-morph pollination and the pollen incompatibility-system decreases seed production after self-pollination, thus diminishing sexual interference. Our results help us understand how the morphological and physiological components of heterostyly contribute to optimizing pollen transfer and minimizing self- and intra-morph pollination, thus promoting more efficient outcrossing in species with this floral polymorphism. </summary> <dc:date>2014-03-17T22:22:22Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: From fine-scale foraging to home ranges: a semi-variance approach to identifying movement modes across spatiotemporal scales</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.45157\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.45157</id> <updated>2015-03-17T06:30:04Z</updated> <published>2013-10-31T14:44:35Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Understanding animal movement is a key challenge in ecology and conservation biology. Relocation data often represent a complex mixture of different movement behaviors, and reliably decomposing this mix into its component parts is an unresolved problem in movement ecology. Traditional approaches, such as composite random walk models, require that the timescales characterizing the movement are all similar to the usually arbitrary data-sampling rate. Movement behaviors such as long-distance searching and fine-scale foraging, however, are often intermixed but operate on vastly different spatial and temporal scales. An approach that integrates the full sweep of movement behaviors across scales is currently lacking. Here we show how the semivariance function (SVF) of a stochastic movement process can both identify multiple movement modes and solve the sampling rate problem. We express a broad range of continuous-space, continuous-time stochastic movement models in terms of their SVFs, connect them to relocation data via variogram regression, and compare them using standard model selection techniques. We illustrate our approach using Mongolian gazelle relocation data and show that gazelle movement is characterized by ballistic foraging movements on a 6-h timescale, fast diffusive searching with a 10-week timescale, and asymptotic diffusion over longer timescales. </summary> <dc:date>2013-10-31T14:44:35Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Artificial selection for food colour preferences</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.k6j0v\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.k6j0v</id> <updated>2015-03-16T21:03:59Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T18:18:37Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Colour is an important factor in food detection and acquisition by animals using visually based foraging. Colour can be used to identify the suitability of a food source or improve the efficiency of food detection, and can even be linked to mate choice. Food colour preferences are known to exist, but whether these preferences are heritable and how these preferences evolve is unknown. Using the freshwater fish Poecilia reticulata, we artificially selected for chase behaviour towards two different-coloured moving stimuli: red and blue spots. A response to selection was only seen for chase behaviours towards the red, with realized heritabilities ranging from 0.25 to 0.30. Despite intense selection, no significant chase response was recorded for the blue-selected lines. This lack of response may be due to the motion-detection mechanism in the guppy visual system and may have novel implications for the evolvability of responses to colour-related signals. The behavioural response to several colours after five generations of selection suggests that the colour opponency system of the fish may regulate the response to selection. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T18:18:37Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Reproductive interference explains persistence of aggression between species</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3rg5m\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3rg5m</id> <updated>2015-03-16T20:56:33Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T18:05:07Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Interspecific territoriality occurs when individuals of different species fight over space, and may arise spontaneously when populations of closely related territorial species first come into contact. But defence of space is costly, and unless the benefits of excluding heterospecifics exceed the costs, natural selection should favour divergence in competitor recognition until the species no longer interact aggressively. Ordinarily males of different species do not compete for mates, but when males cannot distinguish females of sympatric species, females may effectively become a shared resource. We model how reproductive interference caused by undiscriminating males can prevent interspecific divergence, or even cause convergence, in traits used to recognize competitors. We then test the model in a genus of visually orienting insects and show that, as predicted by the model, differences between species pairs in the level of reproductive interference, which is causally related to species differences in female coloration, are strongly predictive of the current level of interspecific aggression. Interspecific reproductive interference is very common and we discuss how it may account for the persistence of interspecific aggression in many taxonomic groups. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T18:05:07Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Selection on male sex pheromone composition contributes to butterfly reproductive isolation</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.768sd\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.768sd</id> <updated>2015-03-16T20:47:23Z</updated> <published>2015-02-03T18:17:27Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Selection can facilitate diversification by inducing character displacement in mate choice traits that reduce the probability of maladaptive mating between lineages. Although reproductive character displacement (RCD) has been demonstrated in two-taxa case studies, the frequency of this process in nature is still debated. Moreover, studies have focused primarily on visual and acoustic traits, despite the fact that chemical communication is probably the most common means of species recognition. Here, we showed in a large, mostly sympatric, butterfly genus, a strong pattern of recurrent RCD for predicted male sex pheromone composition, but not for visual mate choice traits. Our results suggest that RCD is not anecdotal, and that selection for divergence in male sex pheromone composition contributed to reproductive isolation within the Bicyclus genus. We propose that selection may target olfactory mate choice traits as a more common sensory modality to ensure reproductive isolation among diverging lineages than previously envisaged. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-03T18:17:27Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Bypass of genetic constraints during mutator evolution to antibiotic resistance</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.bh123\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.bh123</id> <updated>2015-03-16T20:33:09Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T15:43:32Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Genetic constraints can block many mutational pathways to optimal genotypes in real fitness landscapes, yet the extent to which this can limit evolution remains to be determined. Interestingly, mutator bacteria elevate only specific types of mutations, and therefore could be very sensitive to genetic constraints. Testing this possibility is not only clinically relevant, but can also inform about the general impact of genetic constraints in adaptation. Here, we evolved 576 populations of two mutator and one wild-type Escherichia coli to doubling concentrations of the antibiotic cefotaxime. All strains carried TEM-1, a \\ufffd\\ufffd-lactamase enzyme well known by its low availability of mutational pathways. Crucially, one of the mutators does not elevate any of the relevant first-step mutations known to improve cefatoximase activity. Despite this, both mutators displayed a similar ability to evolve more than 1000-fold resistance. Initial adaptation proceeded in parallel through general multi-drug resistance mechanisms. High-level resistance, in contrast, was achieved through divergent paths; with the a priori inferior mutator exploiting alternative mutational pathways in PBP3, the target of the antibiotic. These results have implications for mutator management in clinical infections and, more generally, illustrate that limits to natural selection in real organisms are alleviated by the existence of multiple loci contributing to fitness. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T15:43:32Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: New insights on postglacial colonisation in Western Europe: the phylogeography of the Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri)</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.6g6r6\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.6g6r6</id> <updated>2015-03-16T20:27:05Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T15:55:51Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Despite recent advances in the understanding of the interplay between a dynamic physical environment and phylogeography in Europe, the origins of contemporary Irish biota remain uncertain. Current thinking is that Ireland was colonized post-glacially from southern European refugia, following the end of the last glacial maximum (LGM), some 20 000 years BP. The Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri), one of the few native Irish mammal species, is widely distributed throughout Europe but, with the exception of Ireland, is generally rare and considered vulnerable. We investigate the origins and phylogeographic relationships of Irish populations in relation to those across Europe, including the closely related species N. azoreum. We use a combination of approaches, including mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, in addition to approximate Bayesian computation and palaeo-climatic species distribution modelling. Molecular analyses revealed two distinct and diverse European mitochondrial DNA lineages, which probably diverged in separate glacial refugia. A western lineage, restricted to Ireland, Britain and the Azores, comprises Irish and British N. leisleri and N. azoreum specimens; an eastern lineage is distributed throughout mainland Europe. Palaeo-climatic projections indicate suitable habitats during the LGM, including known glacial refugia, in addition to potential novel cryptic refugia along the western fringe of Europe. These results may be applicable to populations of many species. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T15:55:51Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Genome reorganization in F1 hybrids uncovers the role of retrotransposons in reproductive isolation</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.918bg\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.918bg</id> <updated>2015-03-16T20:21:40Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T16:20:31Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Interspecific hybridization leads to new interactions among divergent genomes, revealing the nature of genetic incompatibilities having accumulated during and after the origin of species. Conflicts associated with misregulation of transposable elements (TEs) in hybrids expectedly result in their activation and genome-wide changes that may be key to species boundaries. Repetitive genomes of wild wheats have diverged under differential dynamics of specific long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs), offering unparalleled opportunities to address the underpinnings of plant genome reorganization by selfish sequences. Using reciprocal F1 hybrids between three Aegilops species, restructuring and epigenetic repatterning was assessed at random and LTR-RT sequences with amplified fragment length polymorphism and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms as well as their methylation-sensitive counterparts, respectively. Asymmetrical reorganization of LTR-RT families predicted to cause conflicting interactions matched differential survival of F1 hybrids. Consistent with the genome shock model, increasing divergence of merged LTR-RTs yielded higher levels of changes in corresponding genome fractions and lead to repeated reorganization of LTR-RT sequences in F1 hybrids. Such non-random reorganization of hybrid genomes is coherent with the necessary repression of incompatible TE loci in support of hybrid viability and indicates that TE-driven genomic conflicts may represent an overlooked factor supporting reproductive isolation. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T16:20:31Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Phylogenomic resolution of scorpions reveals multilevel discordance with morphological phylogenetic signal</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.n0qr5\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.n0qr5</id> <updated>2015-03-16T20:17:20Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T15:47:43Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Scorpions represent an iconic lineage of arthropods, historically renowned for their unique bauplan, ancient fossil record and venom potency. Yet, higher level relationships of scorpions, based exclusively on morphology, remain virtually untested, and no multilocus molecular phylogeny has been deployed heretofore towards assessing the basal tree topology. We applied a phylogenomic assessment to resolve scorpion phylogeny, for the first time, to our knowledge, sampling extensive molecular sequence data from all superfamilies and examining basal relationships with up to 5025 genes. Analyses of supermatrices as well as species tree approaches converged upon a robust basal topology of scorpions that is entirely at odds with traditional systematics and controverts previous understanding of scorpion evolutionary history. All analyses unanimously support a single origin of katoikogenic development, a form of parental investment wherein embryos are nurtured by direct connections to the parent's digestive system. Based on the phylogeny obtained herein, we propose the following systematic emendations: Caraboctonidae is transferred to Chactoidea new superfamilial assignment; superfamily Bothriuroidea revalidated is resurrected and Bothriuridae transferred therein; and Chaerilida and Pseudochactida are synonymized with Buthida new parvordinal synonymies. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T15:47:43Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Mechanical sensitivity reveals evolutionary dynamics of mechanical systems</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4m7v7\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4m7v7</id> <updated>2015-03-16T19:59:07Z</updated> <published>2015-01-29T18:00:12Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">A classic question in evolutionary biology is how form\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfunction relationships promote or limit diversification. Mechanical metrics, such as kinematic transmission (KT) in linkage systems, are useful tools for examining the evolution of form and function in a comparative context. The convergence of disparate systems on equivalent metric values (mechanical equivalence) has been highlighted as a source of potential morphological diversity under the assumption that morphology can evolve with minimal impact on function. However, this assumption does not account for mechanical sensitivity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe sensitivity of the metric to morphological changes in individual components of a structure. We examined the diversification of a four-bar linkage system in mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda), and found evidence for both mechanical equivalence and differential mechanical sensitivity. KT exhibited variable correlations with individual linkage components, highlighting the components that influence KT evolution, and the components that are free to evolve independently from KT and thereby contribute to the observed pattern of mechanical equivalence. Determining the mechanical sensitivity in a system leads to a deeper understanding of both functional convergence and morphological diversification. This study illustrates the importance of multi-level analyses in delineating the factors that limit and promote diversification in form\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfunction systems. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-29T18:00:12Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Independent evolution of the sexes promotes amphibian diversification</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.j7090\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.j7090</id> <updated>2015-03-16T19:35:25Z</updated> <published>2015-01-22T20:21:27Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Classic ecological theory predicts that the evolution of sexual dimorphism constrains diversification by limiting morphospace available for speciation. Alternatively, sexual selection may lead to the evolution of reproductive isolation and increased diversification. We test contrasting predictions of these hypotheses by examining the relationship between sexual dimorphism and diversification in amphibians. Our analysis shows that the evolution of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is associated with increased diversification and speciation, contrary to the ecological theory. Further, this result is unlikely to be explained by traditional sexual selection models because variation in amphibian SSD is unlikely to be driven entirely by sexual selection. We suggest that relaxing a central assumption of classic ecological models\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthat the sexes share a common adaptive landscape\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdleads to the alternative hypothesis that independent evolution of the sexes may promote diversification. Once the constraints of sexual conflict are relaxed, the sexes can explore morphospace that would otherwise be inaccessible. Consistent with this novel hypothesis, the evolution of SSD in amphibians is associated with reduced current extinction threat status, and an historical reduction in extinction rate. Our work reconciles conflicting predictions from ecological and evolutionary theory and illustrates that the ability of the sexes to evolve independently is associated with a spectacular vertebrate radiation. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-22T20:21:27Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Ocean acidification induces biochemical and morphological changes in the calcification process of large benthic foraminifera</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.28816\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.28816</id> <updated>2015-03-16T19:14:15Z</updated> <published>2015-01-20T16:33:52Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Large benthic foraminifera are significant contributors to sediment formation on coral reefs, yet they are vulnerable to ocean acidification. Here, we assessed the biochemical and morphological impacts of acidification on the calcification of Amphistegina lessonii and Marginopora vertebralis exposed to different pH conditions. We measured growth rates (surface area and buoyant weight) and Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities and calculated shell density using micro-computer tomography images. In A. lessonii, we detected a significant decrease in buoyant weight, a reduction in the density of inner skeletal chambers, and an increase of Ca-ATPase and Mg-ATPase activities at pH 7.6 when compared with ambient conditions of pH 8.1. By contrast, M. vertebralis showed an inhibition in Mg-ATPase activity under lowered pH, with growth rate and skeletal density remaining constant. While M. vertebralis is considered to be more sensitive than A. lessonii owing to its high-Mg-calcite skeleton, it appears to be less affected by changes in pH, based on the parameters assessed in this study. We suggest difference in biochemical pathways of calcification as the main factor influencing response to changes in pH levels, and that A. lessonii and M. vertebralis have the ability to regulate biochemical functions to cope with short-term increases in acidity. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-20T16:33:52Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Social networks predict gut microbiome composition in wild baboons</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.8gp03\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.8gp03</id> <updated>2015-03-16T19:03:53Z</updated> <published>2015-03-16T19:03:50Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Social relationships have profound effects on health in humans and other primates, but the mechanisms that explain this relationship are not well understood.

Rates of interaction directly explained variation in the gut microbiome, even after controlling for diet, kinship, and shared environments. They therefore strongly implicate direct physical contact among social partners in the transmission of gut microbial species.

Consequently, miRNAs have been used as rare genome change characters to estimate phylogeny by tracking their gain and loss. However, their short length (21\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd23 bp) has limited their perceived utility in sequenced-based phylogenetic inference. Here, using reference taxa with established phylogenetic relationships, we demonstrate that miRNA sequences are of high utility in quantitative, rather than in qualitative, phylogenetic analysis. The clear orthology among miRNA genes from different species makes it straightforward to identify and align these sequences from even fragmentary datasets. We also identify significant sequence conservation in the regions directly flanking miRNA genes, and show that this too is of utility in phylogenetic analysis, as well as highlighting conserved regions that will be of interest to other fields. Employing miRNA sequences from 12 sequenced drosophilid genomes, together with a Tribolium castaneum outgroup, we demonstrate that this approach is robust using Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods. The utility of these characters is further demonstrated in the rhabditid nematodes and primates. As next-generation sequencing makes it more cost-effective to sequence genomes and small RNA libraries, this methodology provides an alternative data source for phylogenetic analysis. The approach allows rapid resolution of relationships between both closely related and rapidly evolving species, and provides an additional tool for investigation of relationships within the tree of life. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-22T20:41:51Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Climate and fishing steer ecosystem regeneration to uncertain economic futures</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.m1s8s\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.m1s8s</id> <updated>2015-03-16T18:18:46Z</updated> <published>2015-01-22T21:20:57Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Overfishing of large predatory fish populations has resulted in lasting restructurings of entire marine food webs worldwide, with serious socio-economic consequences. Fortunately, some degraded ecosystems show signs of recovery. A key challenge for ecosystem management is to anticipate the degree to which recovery is possible. By applying a statistical food-web model, using the Baltic Sea as a case study, we show that under current temperature and salinity conditions, complete recovery of this heavily altered ecosystem will be impossible. Instead, the ecosystem regenerates towards a new ecological baseline. This new baseline is characterized by lower and more variable biomass of cod, the commercially most important fish stock in the Baltic Sea, even under very low exploitation pressure. Furthermore, a socio-economic assessment shows that this signal is amplified at the level of societal costs, owing to increased uncertainty in biomass and reduced consumer surplus. Specifically, the combined economic losses amount to approximately 120 million \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd per year, which equals half of today's maximum economic yield for the Baltic cod fishery. Our analyses suggest that shifts in ecological and economic baselines can lead to higher economic uncertainty and costs for exploited ecosystems, in particular, under climate change. </summary> <dc:date>2015-01-22T21:20:57Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Secondary metabolites in floral nectar reduce parasite infections in bumblebees</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.m2n6f\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.m2n6f</id> <updated>2015-03-16T18:09:42Z</updated> <published>2015-02-16T19:38:51Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The synthesis of secondary metabolites is a hallmark of plant defence against herbivores. These compounds may be detrimental to consumers, but can also protect herbivores against parasites. Floral nectar commonly contains secondary metabolites, but little is known about the impacts of nectar chemistry on pollinators, including bees. We hypothesized that nectar secondary metabolites could reduce bee parasite infection. We inoculated individual bumblebees with Crithidia bombi, an intestinal parasite, and tested effects of eight naturally occurring nectar chemicals on parasite population growth. Secondary metabolites strongly reduced parasite load, with significant effects of alkaloids, terpenoids and iridoid glycosides ranging from 61 to 81%. Using microcolonies, we also investigated costs and benefits of consuming anabasine, the compound with the strongest effect on parasites, in infected and uninfected bees. Anabasine increased time to egg laying, and Crithidia reduced bee survival. However, anabasine consumption did not mitigate the negative effects of Crithidia, and Crithidia infection did not alter anabasine consumption. Our novel results highlight that although secondary metabolites may not rescue survival in infected bees, they may play a vital role in mediating Crithidia transmission within and between colonies by reducing Crithidia infection intensities. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-16T19:38:51Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Plasticity and epistasis strongly affect bacterial fitness after losing multiple metabolic genes</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.hq701\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.hq701</id> <updated>2015-03-16T17:58:05Z</updated> <published>2015-03-09T15:32:46Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Many bacterial lineages lack seemingly essential metabolic genes.

Here we determine the effect of plasticity and epistasis on the fitness of Escherichia coli genotypes from whose genome biosynthetic genes for one, two, or three different amino acids have been deleted.

Positive and negative epistatic interactions were prevalent, yet on average cancelled each other out. Moreover, epistasis correlated negatively with the expected effects of combined auxotrophy-causing mutations, thus producing a pattern of diminishing returns. Moreover, computationally analysing 1,432 eubacterial metabolic networks revealed that most pairs of auxotrophies co-occurred significantly more often than expected by chance, suggesting epistatic interactions and/ or environmental factors favoured these combinations. Our results demonstrate that both the genetic background and environmental conditions determine the adaptive value of a loss-of-biochemical-function mutation and that fitness gains decelerate, as more biochemical functions are lost. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-09T15:32:46Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Rates of karyotypic evolution in Estrildid finches differ between island and continental clades</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4t83t\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.4t83t</id> <updated>2015-03-16T17:51:41Z</updated> <published>2015-03-02T15:48:19Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Reasons why chromosomal rearrangements spread to fixation and frequently distinguish related taxa remain poorly understood. We used cytological descriptions of karyotype to identify large pericentric inversions between species of Estrildid finches (family Estrildidae) and a time-dated phylogeny to assess the genomic, geographic, and phylogenetic context of karyotype evolution in this group. Inversions between finch species fixed at an average rate of one every 2.26 My. Inversions were twice as likely to fix on the sex chromosomes compared to the autosomes. A high repeat density on the sex chromosomes may increase mutation rates, but other explanations via mutagenic input are not supported, as the number of inversions on a chromosome does not correlate with its length or map size. Inversions have fixed 3.3\\ufffd\\ufffd faster in three continental clades than in two island chain clades, and fixation rate correlates with both range size and the number of sympatric species pairs. These results point to adaptation as the dominant mechanism driving fixation and suggest a role for gene flow in karyotype divergence. A review shows that the rapid karyotype evolution observed in the Estrildid finches appears to be more general across birds, and by implication other understudied taxa. </summary> <dc:date>2015-03-02T15:48:19Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Data from: Quantifying hummingbird preference for floral trait combinations: the role of selection on trait interactions in the evolution of pollination syndromes</title> <link href=\"http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.754c6\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.754c6</id> <updated>2015-03-16T17:47:17Z</updated> <published>2015-02-19T20:09:31Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Darwin recognized the flower's importance for the study of adaptation and emphasized that the flower's functionality reflects the coordinated action of multiple traits. Here we use a multi-trait manipulative approach to quantify the potential role of selection acting on floral trait combinations underlying the divergence and maintenance of three related North American species of Silene (Caryophyllaceae). We artificially generated 48 plant phenotypes corresponding to all combinations of key attractive traits differing among the three Silene species (color, height, inflorescence architecture, flower orientation, and corolla-tube width). We quantified main and interaction effects of trait manipulation on hummingbird visitation preference using experimental arrays. The main effects of floral display height and floral orientation strongly influenced hummingbird visitation, with hummingbirds preferring flowers held high above the ground and vertically to the sky. Hummingbirds also prefer traits in a non-additive manner as multiple two-way and higher-order interaction effects were important predictors of hummingbird visitation. Contemporary trait combinations found in hummingbird pollinated S. virginica are mostly preferred. Our study demonstrates the likelihood of pollination syndromes evolving due to selection on trait combinations and highlights the importance of trait interactions in understanding the evolution of complex adaptations. </summary> <dc:date>2015-02-19T20:09:31Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
