To this end, we exploit a unique event in human history, the exodus of the Vietnamese Boat People to the US. This episode represents an ideal natural experiment as the large immigration shock, the first wave of which comprised refugees exogenously allocated across the US, occurred over a twenty-year period during which time the US imposed a complete trade embargo on Vietnam. Following the lifting of trade restrictions in 1994, the share of US exports going to Vietnam was higher and more diversified in those US States with larger Vietnamese populations, themselves the result of larger refugee inflows 20 years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:10944</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-08T22:39:03Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>\\ufffd\\ufffdzden, \\ufffd\\ufffda\\ufffd\\ufffdlar </dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Parsons, Christopher</dc:creator>   <dc:title>On the Economic Geography of International Migration</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-06-27</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/10944</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.10944</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;We exploit the bilateral and skill dimensions from recent data sets of international migration to test for the existence of Zipf&amp;#39;s and Gibrat&amp;#39;s Laws in the context of aggregate and high-skilled international immigration and emigration using graphical, parametric and non-parametric analysis. The top tails of the distributions of aggregate and high-skilled immigrants and emigrants adhere to a Pareto distribution with an exponent of unity i.e. Zipf&amp;#39;s Law holds. We find some evidence in favour of Gibrat&amp;#39;s Law holding for immigration stocks, i.e. that the growth in stocks is independent of their initial values and stronger evidence that immigration densities are diverging over time. Conversely, emigrant stocks are converging in the sense that countries with smaller emigrant stocks are growing faster than their larger sovereign counterparts. Lastly, high skilled immigration and emigration stocks expressed in levels or as densities all exhibit signs of convergence. We conclude by discussing some competing mechanisms that could be driving the observed patterns including: differing fertility rates, reductions in emigration restrictions, migrant sorting and selective immigration policies, immigrant networks and persisting wage differentials.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:10945</identifier><datestamp>2014-09-10T09:03:27Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:source>International Migration Review: 44 (2010) no. 1, pp. 227\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd264</dc:source>   <dc:creator>de Haas, Hein</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Migration and Development: A Theoretical Perspective</dc:title>   <dc:date>2010-03-05</dc:date>   <dc:date>         info:eu-repo/date/embargoEnd/2011-03-06</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/10945</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.1111/j.1747-7379.2009.00804.x</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The debate on migration and development has swung back and forth like a pendulum, from developmentalist optimism in the 1950s and 1960s, to neo-Marxist pessimism over the 1970s and 1980s, towards more optimistic views in the 1990s and 2000s. This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory. However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts. By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies &amp;ndash; which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels &amp;ndash; this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration-development interactions. The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self-help development &amp;ldquo;from below&amp;rdquo;. These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/240940</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/embargoedAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:10947</identifier><datestamp>2014-09-10T09:03:27Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Natter, Katharina</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Fifty years of Maghreb emigration: How states shaped Algerian, Moroccan and Tunisian emigration</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-07-17</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/10947</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.10947</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This paper analyses emigration from Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to main European and North American destinations since the 1960s. It explores the role of states, post-colonial ties and migration policies in emigration dynamics. By adopting a historical-comparative approach and an origin country perspective, this paper shows that Maghreb emigration was continuously shaped not only by government strategies in Europe but also by those of Maghreb states. Drawing on new bilateral migration flow data compiled in the DEMIG C2C database, the paper reveals three distinct phases in which Maghreb emigration patterns converge and diverge: the post-independence period in which Maghreb emigration boomed; the period from the mid-1970s until the early 1990s when Algerian emigration levelled off while emigration from neighbouring countries&amp;rsquo; remained high; and the period from the early 1990s when Moroccan emigration increased exponentially while Tunisian and Algerian only grew moderately. Similarities in Maghreb emigration patterns can be explained by the countries&amp;rsquo; comparable geopolitical and socio-economic features and that European states apply the same immigration policies to all Maghreb countries. To understand the divergences however, a closer look at origin country factors is required. The paper finds that Algeria&amp;rsquo;s departure from regional emigration patterns in the 1970s can be traced back to the emigration stop implemented by the Algerian government in 1973. Conversely, the active promotion of emigration by the Moroccan state facilitated emigration by making access to passport easier and fostering a culture of emigration that together with high unemployment partly explains Morocco&amp;rsquo;s emigration boom after the 1990s. Finally, recent diversification of Maghreb emigration to divergent South European countries, can be attributed to specific historical linkages, with Moroccans and Algerians mainly migrating to Spain and Tunisians to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/240940</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:11065</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-08T22:39:11Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>de Haas, Hein</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Natter, Katharina</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Vezzoli, Simona</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Growing restrictiveness or changing selection?

The findings challenge the common assumption that migration policies have become increasingly restrictive over the past decades, and instead demonstrate that since 1945 migration policies have been consistently dominated by less restrictive changes. This trend is robust across a large number of countries, but differs across policy types and migrant categories. While entry and integration policies have generally become less restrictive, border control and, since the 1990s, exit policies have become more restrictive. Instead of a growing restrictiveness, the essence of post-WWII migration policies has been an increasing sophistication through the development of specific policy instruments targeting particular immigrant groups. While policies towards migrant categories such as irregular migrants and, more recently, family members have often become more restrictive, a larger number of &amp;ndash; generally less visible &amp;ndash; policies targeting high and low-skilled workers, students and migrants from specific origins have become less restrictive. Migration policies should therefore be understood as a tool of migrant selection rather than as an instrument affecting numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/240940</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:11218</identifier><datestamp>2014-08-08T22:39:20Z</datestamp><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Loschmann, Craig</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Parsons, Christopher</dc:creator>   <dc:creator>Siegel, Melissa</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Does Shelter Assistance reduce Poverty in Afghanistan?</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-08-05</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/11218</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.11218</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Forced migration, often resulting from violent conflict, imposes large economic costs on both sending and receiving countries, on those agencies that coordinate humanitarian services and most importantly upon the forced migrants themselves. Programs encouraging the return of refugees are therefore potentially crucial interventions, which can result in all parties benefiting. In this paper, we assess the UNHCR post-return shelter assistance program in Afghanistan between 2009 and 2011, the country most affected by refugee movements, where no less than one-third of the population is a returnee. We are motivated by the fact that the resolution of lost housing and property is commonly understood as a key ingredient in sustainable return and reintegration. Given the infeasibility of randomizing shelter assistance to those repatriated, we implement a variety of matching techniques to insulate our results from selection biases. Adopting a multidimensional approach, our results show that shelter assistance reduces multidimensional poverty by around six percent. This reduction in poverty is driven by particular indicators of deprivation including dietary diversity, food security and heating, all of which are shown to fall by five to six percent depending on the matching specification. The former results are particularly encouraging in the context of Afghanistan given the prevalence of chronic malnutrition in the country.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12681</identifier><datestamp>2015-01-09T08:11:35Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>de Haas, Hein</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Migration Theory: Quo Vadis?</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-11-13</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12681</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.12681</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This paper elaborates an aspirations&amp;ndash;capabilities framework to advance our understanding of human mobility. Arguing in favour of conceptual eclecticism to bridge disciplinary and paradigmatic divides, the paper conceives migration as an intrinsic part of broader processes of social transformation and development. In this perspective, theoretical assumptions are seen as contextualised statements rather than mutually exclusive truth claims. On the macro-level, such conceptualisation of migration requires embedding the analysis of migration into broader theories of social change without reverting back to the top-down causal determinism of many historical-structural and functionalist theories. To develop a more meaningful understanding of agency in migration processes, and building upon Carling&amp;rsquo;s (2002) earlier work, the paper proposes a meta-theoretical conceptualisation of migration as a function of aspirations and capabilities to migrate within a given set of opportunity structures. Drawing on Sen&amp;rsquo;s capabilities approach, this paper defines human mobility as people&amp;rsquo;s capability (freedom) to choose where to live, including the option to stay. While distinguishing between the instrumental (means to an end) and intrinsic (directly wellbeing-enhancing) dimensions of human mobility, this conceptualises moving and staying as complementary manifestations of the same migratory agency. This allows to move beyond the rather futile debate over whether migration or sedentary behaviour is the norm and to overcome dichotomous and simplistic classifications such as between forced and voluntary migration. The paper draws on Berlin&amp;rsquo;s concepts of positive and negative liberty to conceptualise the complex and non-linear ways in which structural conditions shape migration aspirations and capabilities. The resulting expanded aspirations-capabilities framework is used to elaborate a theoretical categorisation of five ideal, typical mobility types. The concepts of positive and negative liberty (as manifestations of different structural conditions under which migration occurs) are used to elaborate a categorisation of four contextual migration categories, to which different migration theories have different degrees of explanatory power.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/240940</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12768</identifier><datestamp>2015-01-08T11:00:32Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Mahendra, Edo</dc:creator>   <dc:title>Financial Constraints, Social Policy and Migration: Evidence from Indonesia</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-11-17</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12768</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.12768</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This paper combines insights from the New Economics of Labour Migration and Sen&amp;rsquo;s capability approach to analyse how financial constraints and social policy in the sending country influence migration decisions of households. It particularly looks into social protection (cash transfers) and quasi-public goods (health and education infrastructure) in Indonesia. The paper analyses the impact of the 2005 unconditional cash transfers scheme in Indonesia on households&amp;rsquo; migration decisions. It combines internal and international migration in an integrated empirical analysis. Household-level data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey and the district-level data of education and health infrastructure are used for the empirical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This paper finds that financial constraints and social policy significantly impact migration decisions. Their effects, however, vary according to the households&amp;rsquo; deprivation profiles and the types of migration. The impact of unconditional cash transfer schemes depends on its income and substitution effects. Using propensity score matching strategy, I find that unconditional cash transfers increase the incentives for households to engage in internal migration but have no significant impact on international migration. I also find that multidimensionally poor households who receive unconditional cash transfers are less likely to have an international migrant family member but are more likely to engage in internal migration. Households with lack access to finance have lower propensity to participate in international migration. Better access to education and health facilities is associated with less international migration.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/240940</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><record><header><identifier>oai:zenodo.org:12769</identifier><datestamp>2015-01-08T11:00:32Z</datestamp><setSpec>user-zenodo</setSpec><setSpec>openaire</setSpec><setSpec>user-ecfunded</setSpec><setSpec>user-intmiginstitute</setSpec></header><metadata><oai_dc:dc xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:oai_dc=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc/ http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/oai_dc.xsd\">   <dc:creator>Vezzoli, Simona</dc:creator>   <dc:title>The role of the origin state in international migration: Exploring the transition from colony to independence</dc:title>   <dc:date>2014-11-19</dc:date>   <dc:subject>cc-by</dc:subject>   <dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/12769</dc:identifier>   <dc:identifier>           doi:10.5281/zenodo.12769</dc:identifier>   <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This paper presents a conceptual framework to examine how the state shapes international migration in origin and destination countries, particularly in former colonies transitioning to independence or non-sovereignty.

Yet such perceptions are based on stereotypes rather than theoretically informed empirical research. Drawing on the migration and visa databases from the Determinants of International Migration &amp;ndash; DEMIG project and the Global Bilateral Migration Database (GBMD), this paper explores the evolution and drivers of migration within, towards and from Africa in the post-colonial period. Contradicting common ideas of Africa as a &amp;lsquo;continent on the move&amp;rsquo;, the analysis shows that intra-African migration intensities have gone down. This may be related to state formation and the related imposition of barriers towards free movement in the wake of decolonisation as well as the concomitant rise of nationalism and inter-state tensions. While African migration remains overwhelmingly intra-continental, since the late 1980s there has been an acceleration and spatial diversification (beyond colonial patterns) of emigration out of Africa to Europe, North America, the Gulf and Asia. This diversification of African emigration seems partly driven by the introduction of visa and other immigration restrictions by European states. Contradicting conventional interpretations of African migration being essentially driven by poverty, violence and underdevelopment, increasing migration out of Africa seems rather to be driven by processes of development and social transformation which have increased Africans&amp;rsquo; capabilities and aspirations to migrate, a trend which is likely to continue in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>   <dc:relation>         info:eu-repo/grantAgreement/EC/FP7/240940</dc:relation>   <dc:rights>         info:eu-repo/semantics/openAccess       </dc:rights>   <dc:type>       info:eu-repo/semantics/article     </dc:type> </oai_dc:dc> </metadata></record><resumptionToken cursor=\"0\" completeListSize=\"12\" expirationDate=\"2015-03-13T20:29:11Z\">user-intmiginstitute___vsl9on</resumptionToken></ListRecords> </OAI-PMH>  ",
