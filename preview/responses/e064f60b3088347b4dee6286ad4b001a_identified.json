The British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) is similar to the  General Social Survey carried out by the National Opinion Research  Center (NORC) in the United States. The BSA questionnaire has two  parts, one administered by an interviewer and the other completed by  the respondent. As in the past, the 1996 interview questionnaire  contained a number of \"core\" questions covering the major topic areas  of defense, the economy, labor market participation, and the welfare  state. The 1996 self-enumerated questionnaire was devoted to a series  of questions on a range of social, economic, political, and moral  issues. Topics covered (by section) are: (1) newspaper readership, (2)  party identification, (3) housing, (4) electoral registration,  politics, and political knowledge, (5) public spending, welfare  benefits, and health care, (6) economic activity, labor market, and  learning (including respondent's occupation), (7) scratchcards (the  lottery), (8) social divisions, (9) political trust and Europe, (10)  Northern Ireland, (11) taste and decency, (12) classification, (13)  countryside, (14) transportation, (15) public understanding of  science, (16) education, (17) local authority spending, (18)  charitable giving, and (19) welfare/Social Security. An international  initiative funded by the Nuffield Foundation, the International Social  Survey Program (ISSP), also contributes a module to the BSA. The topic  of the ISSP module in this collection was the role of government.  Additional demographic data included age, education, income, marital status, and religious and political affiliations.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1996-05\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-05</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1996-08\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-08</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1996-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-04</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1996-08\" cycle=\"P1\">1996-08</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Great Britain</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>All adults aged 17 or over living in Great Britain in private households.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Multistage stratified random sampling consisting of two  stages of selection.

(2) Under  agreement with the UKDA, the data are disseminated as they were  received, without additional processing by ICPSR. This agreement also  provides that ICPSR will disseminate the data only for use within its  member institutions. Persons from nonmember institutions may request  these data directly from the UKDA. (3) The data are provided as an  SPSS portable file. (4) The documentation was converted to Portable  Document Format (PDF) by the UKDA and concatenated by ICPSR.  The PDF documentation can also be  downloaded from the <ExtLink URI=\"http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/\">UKDA Web  site</ExtLink>. (5) The formats for some variables in the SPSS portable  file (e.g., NWATTECN) are not wide enough to accommodate the missing  value specifications. For some procedures SPSS will display these  missing values as asterisks. Users can widen the formats to display  the actual missing value codes. (6) The documentation contains  information for two different studies: British Social Attitudes, 1994,  and Northern Ireland Social Attitudes, 1994. However, only the British  Social Attitudes dataset is provided in this collection. (7) The  British Social Attitudes Survey series began in 1983 and was conducted  every year since, except in 1988 and 1992 when the core funding from  the Sainsbury Family Charitable Trusts was devoted to conducting  post-election studies of political attitudes and voting behavior in the British Election Study (BES) survey series.                               </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR03099.v2\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
