This dissertation examines the benefits of using audio assistive technology on the iPad to support LD students to achieve comprehension of science vocabulary and semantics. This dissertation is composed of two papers, both of which include qualitative information supported by quantified data. The first paper, titled Using Technology to Overcome Fundamental Literacy Constraints for Students with Learning Differences to Achieve Scientific Literacy, provides quantified evidence from pretest and posttest analysis that audio technology can be beneficial for seventh grade LD students when learning new and unfamiliar science content. Analysis of observations and student interviews support the findings. The second paper, titled Time, Energy, and Motivation: Utilizing Technology to Ease Science Understanding for Students with Learning Differences, supports the importance of creating technology that is clear, audible, and easy for students to use so they benefit and desire to utilize the learning tool. Multiple correlation of Likert Survey analysis was used to identify four major items and was supported with analysis from observations of and interviews with students, parents, and educators. This study provides useful information to support the rising number of identified LD students and their parents and teachers by presenting the benefits of using audio assistive technology to learn science.     </abstract>    <note>Ph.D., Columbia University.</note>    <subject>       <topic>Science education</topic>    </subject>    <subject>       <topic>Special education</topic>    </subject>    <subject>       <topic>Educational technology</topic>    </subject>    <identifier type=\"CDRS doi\">http://dx.doi.org/10.7916/D8R49NZ2</identifier>    <extension xmlns:rioxxterms=\"http://docs.rioxx.net/schema/v2.0/rioxxterms/\" xmlns=\"http://www.loc.gov/mods/v3\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://docs.rioxx.net/schema/v2.0/rioxxterms/ http://docs.rioxx.net/schema/v2.0/rioxxterms.xsd\">       <free_to_read start_date=\"2014-05-12\"/>    </extension>    <location>       <physicalLocation authority=\"marcorg\">NNC</physicalLocation>    </location>    <recordInfo>       <recordContentSource authority=\"marcorg\">NNC</recordContentSource>       <recordCreationDate>2014-07-07 11:46:59 -0400</recordCreationDate>       <recordChangeDate>2014-07-29 16:13:03 -0400</recordChangeDate>       <recordIdentifier>14883</recordIdentifier>       <languageOfCataloging>          <languageTerm authority=\"iso639-2b\">eng</languageTerm>       </languageOfCataloging>    </recordInfo> </mods> ",
