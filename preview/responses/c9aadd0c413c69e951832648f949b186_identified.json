The weight in milligrams (mg) is given of each surviving bee recorded as it was removed from the outside of the nest as we progressed towards the nest core. Bumblebee colonies of similar mass were provided with sugar syrup (UT, n=12), containing chlorpyrifos (CP, 150  nanomolar nM, n=6) imidacloprid (IMD, 10 nM, n= 6) or both (IMD + CP, n=12). No pollen was provided and bees were free to forage in a wilderness/grassland area in the west of Scotland.

The data are national estimates generated by analysing the sample data from up to 591 1km squares and scaling up to a national level. The data are summarized as percentage increase or decrease in habitat area per Land Class (areas of similar environmental characteristics) and are in a vector format. The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB and using the 'ITE Land Classification' as a method of stratification. The data were collected as part of Countryside Survey, a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978 by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology. The countryside is sampled and surveyed using rigorous scientific methods, allowing us to compare new results with those from previous surveys.

The fields were located at the Hillesden Estate in Buckinghamshire, UK, where a randomised block experiment had been implemented to examine the effects of converting differing proportions of arable land to wildlife habitat. The fields were planted with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) followed by break crops of either oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) or field beans (Vicia faba L.). Three treatments were applied at random: a control (\"business as usual\"), Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) treatment and ELS Extra treatment. The ELS treatment involved removing 1% of land to create wildlife habitats. The ELS Extra had a greater proportion of land removed (6%) and additional wildlife habitats included. The total yield of each crop was measured at the time of harvesting using a yield meter attached to the combine harvester. From these values, yield per hectare and the ratio of crop yield to regional average yield were calculated.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>OSR</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>field beans</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>winter wheat</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Brassica napus</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Vicia faba</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Triticum aestivum</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hillesden</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Buckinghamshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>farming</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Entry Level Stewardship</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ELS</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainable Land Management</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-11T10:48:32Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7e2981e7-bd4c-4992-b7b0-1b1253bfd20d\">     <title>Countryside Survey estimates of Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1990,1998 and 2007</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7e2981e7-bd4c-4992-b7b0-1b1253bfd20d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of change data for areas of Broad Habitats across Great Britain between 1990 and 1998, between 1990 and 2007, and between 1998 and 2007.

The data are summarized as change in habitat area per Land Class (areas of similar environmental characteristics). The sample sites are chosen from a stratified random sample, based on a 15 by 15 km grid of GB and using the 'ITE Land Classification' as a method of stratification. The data were collected as part of Countryside Survey, a unique study or 'audit' of the natural resources of the UK's countryside. The Survey has been carried out at regular intervals since 1978 by the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology.

The strata were created from the multivariate analysis of 75 environmental variables, including climatic data, topographic data, human geographical features and geology data.  The Land Classification has provided a stratification for successive ecological surveys (the Countryside Survey of Great Britain), the results of which have characterised the classes in terms of botanical, zoological and landscape features.  Additionally, the Land Classification can be used to stratify a wide range of ecological and biogeographical surveys to improve the efficiency of collection, analysis and presentation of information derived from a sample.  There are three versions of the Classification available. 1. The 1990 version containing 32 classes, which was the first to classify all 240,000km squares in Great Britain (building on an earlier 1978 version based on a sample of squares only).  2. A 1998 version, when the Land Classification was adjusted to 40 classes as a consequence of the need to provide National Estimates (from Countryside Survey 2000) for habitats for Scotland in addition to GB as a whole. 3. In 2007, the Land Classification was adjusted once again, to 45 classes, as a consequence of the need to provide Wales-only estimates in addition to those for Scotland and GB as a whole (from Countryside Survey 2007).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Philip Trembath</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Bio-geographical regions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land classification</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ITE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Institute of Terrestrial Ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Countryside Survey</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>infoMapAccessService</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-12-05T13:34:37Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/362bff26-d2ca-4700-b1f0-22072f4bc0cc\">     <title>Countryside Survey 1984  mapped estimates of linear feature lengths in Great Britain</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/362bff26-d2ca-4700-b1f0-22072f4bc0cc</link>     <description>This dataset consists of stock (length) data for linear features across Great Britain in 1984 in a vector format.

Bird abundance and distribution on Peak District farms and moorlands, 2007-2008  The study is part of the NERC Rural Economy and Land Use (RELU) programme.  The project used the Peak District National Park as a case study to examine the impact of hill farming practices on upland biodiversity (using birds as an indicator group); how hill farms were responding to ongoing and future changes to policies and prices; what this would in turn imply for upland biodiversity; what the public wanted from upland ecosystems and how policies could be designed better to deliver public goods from hill farms.  To answer these questions, the project team conducted ecological and economic surveys on hill farms; used survey results to parameterise ecological and economic models of this farming system; developed new ways to integrate these into coupled ecological and economic models and paid particular attention to interactions across farm boundaries; used the models to evaluate the performance of existing policies and to test designs that could lead to more effective policies; and conducted a range of choice experiments with different cross-sections of the general public to evaluate their preferences for upland landscapes.  Choice experiment, socio-economic survey and model data from this study are available at the UK Data Archive under study number 6363 (see online resources).  Further documentation for this study may be found through the RELU Knowledge Portal and the project's ESRC funding award web page (see online resources).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Rick Stuart</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Species distribution</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rural Economy and Land Use Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sustainability of Hill Farming - Ecology Data</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>2007-2008</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Peak district</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Agricultural economics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Agricultural policy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Agriculture</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biodiversity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Birds</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Farmers</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Farming systems</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Farms</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Habitats</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land use</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Landscape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Moorlands</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rural economics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Uplands</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-11T20:30:25Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
