Part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) project.  Hydrolab H20 water quality monitors were installed at ten sites and used to log water temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen between 1994 and 1997. Data were collected continuously at 30 minute intervals (for periods of variable lengths depending on site) between 1994 and 1997. Data were collected using Hydrolab DataSonde 3 continuous monitoring units. Hydrolabs at River Nidd (Hunsingore) and the River Swale (Crakehill) were suspended from trees. The other hydrolabs were located in large steel pipes running from the bank into the rivers which allowed the flow of water over the probes but offered a high degree of safety from damage by vandals and large water borne objects. The units on the Trent and the Ouse at Skelton were fitted with stirrers, as the probes were prone to fouling by the high levels of suspended solids often encountered in these rivers during spate conditions. The deployment of the units and the collection of data were carried out by members of the field sampling team at York University, as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>temperature</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pH</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>conductivity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>dissolved oxygen</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrolab</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Humber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Swale</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Derwent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calder</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Trent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ouse</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nidd</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-19T10:54:28Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/329cbe8f-a292-4c5f-a15a-6528774dbee7\">     <title>Field measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature data from rivers [LOIS]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/329cbe8f-a292-4c5f-a15a-6528774dbee7</link>     <description>On site measurements of pH, conductivity and temperature for thirteen sites in the Humber catchment and three sites in the Tweed catchment within the period 1994 to 1997 as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study project (LOIS). Sites were sampled at regular weekly intervals and more intermittently during high flows (on average an extra sampling once a month per site). Samples were obtained using a wide neck PTFE bottle in a plastic covered bottle carrier (lowered from bridges where possible otherwise collected by immersing sample bottle by hand in the water as near the main flow as possible). pH and conductivity reading were taken using Mettler Toledo Check Mate meters and probes.  Temperature readings were obtained using a PT 100 probe with a Digitron 3204 Pt meter (RS components). The measurements were carried out by members of the field sampling team at York University, as part of the Land Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS).</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>water quality</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>temperature</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pH</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>conductivity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Humber</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Swale</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Derwent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Aire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Calder</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Trent</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Ouse</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Nidd</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LOIS</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-18T16:20:03Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/2969776d-0b59-4435-a746-da50b8fd62a3\">     <title>Loch Leven long-term monitoring data: phosphorus, silica and chlorophyll concentrations, water clarity and temperature, 1985-2007</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/2969776d-0b59-4435-a746-da50b8fd62a3</link>     <description>A subset of the Loch Leven long-term monitoring project dataset.
