The event themes were merged into a statewide polygon shapefile.  An Excel spreadsheet containing the 2004 Final 303(d) List of Impaired Waters, approved by U.S. EPA on May 13, 2004 was converted to a lookup table.  Each row of the table contained the Lake ID as well as pollutant/stressor attributes.  The table was joined to the statewide polygon shapefile on the Lake ID.  A shapefile was exported from ArcView 3.2x. for only those polygons with a match in the 2004 303(d) lookup table.  The shapefile was imported as an SDE feature class for use in the Environmental Data Access application.</procdesc> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref></indspref> <direct>Vector</direct> <mgmg3obj>Polygon</mgmg3obj> <mgmg3til></mgmg3til> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres></latres> <longres></longres> </geograph> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn></mapprojn> <mgmg4par></mgmg4par> <otherprj></otherprj> </mapproj> <gridsys> <gridsysn>UTM</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>15</utmzone> </utm> <spcs> <spcszone></spcszone> </spcs> <mgmg4coz></mgmg4coz> <mgmg4adj></mgmg4adj> </gridsys> <planci> <coordrep> <absres></absres> <ordres></ordres> </coordrep> <distbrep> <distres></distres> </distbrep> <plandu>Meters</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>NAD83</horizdn> <ellips>GRS80</ellips> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum></altdatum> <altunits></altunits> </altsys> <depthsys> <depthdn></depthdn> <depthdu></depthdu> </depthsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>All lakes contained in this shapefile are considered to be impaired by the MPCA.</eaover> <eadetcit>AUID = Assessment Unit ID is  the MN Department of Natural Resources Public Waters Inventory number which is formatted CC-LLLL-BB.  CC is the two digit county number, LLLL is the four digit lake number (unique within county) and BB is the two digit bay number (00 if the id represents the entire lake).

These become the List of impaired waters.  A  reach can only be placed into one Category.  For example, if a reach is impaired for one pollutant but the other uses are being met, and a TMDL is required, that reach would be placed into Category 5.  Furthermore, if the reach is impaired for more than one pollutant, the reach must stay in Category 5 until ALL pollutants have EPA-approved TMDL plans.  For 'bookkeeping' purposes, these Categories can be sub-divided.  Category 4 has the following four sub-categories: 4A: Impaired, but a TMDL study has been approved by EPA 4B: Impaired, but a TMDL study is not required because water quality standards are expected to be met in the near future 4C: Impaired, but a TMDL study is not required because the impairment is not caused by a pollutant 4D: An assessment unit is impaired or threatened but doesn't require a TMDL because the impairment is due to natural conditions with only insignificant anthropogenic influence.  To be considered \\ufffd\\ufffdinsignificant\\ufffd\\ufffd, the elimination of the anthropogenic influence would not lead to the attainment of water quality standards and it would not be included in formal pollution reduction goal-setting activities.  A reach-specific water quality standard based on local natural conditions has yet to be determined. Upon determination, the assessment unit will be considered non-impaired for the natural conditions and re-categorized to an appropriate category.  Category 5 has the following three sub-categories: 5A: Impaired by multiple pollutants and no TMDL study plans are approved by EPA 5B: Impaired by multiple pollutants and at least one TMDL study plan is approved by EPA 5C: Impaired by one pollutant and no TMDL study plan is approved by EPA</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Carrie Bartz</cntper> <cntorg>Minnesota Pollution Control Agency</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>Information Technology Specialist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype> Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>520 Lafayette Road</address> <city>St. Paul</city> <state>MN</state> <postal>55155</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>651-296-9323</cntvoice> <cntfax>651-282-5446</cntfax> <cntemail>carrie.bartz@state.mn.us</cntemail> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc>Downloadable Data</resdesc> <distliab>NOTICE: The Geographic Information System (GIS) Data to which this notice is attached are made available pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).
