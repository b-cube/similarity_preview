Keb is a dance in which people dance without drum beats. But the person who leads the song must have a strong voice, sometimes the song is led by two people. This song shows that Papwojo Youth have increased in number, and they need more dancing mates, so the composer starts the song by asking permission from the youth leader to allow him to compose this song, because he knew that the song will motivate the youth. The composer says: Papwojo Youth dance well; small girls wish to grow up fast so that they dance with Papwojo Youth. The composer says that Papwojo is a strong village; it killed a lion alone while its neighbor, Ayijdhajo, feared to fight the lion. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-23T09:45:22Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/718\"> <title>LuciaOywalAtitker_songGovernanceInSouthSudanParts1&amp;2</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/718</link> <description>LuciaOywalAtitker_songGovernanceInSouthSudanParts1&amp;2 The recordings at the center of this item are two Shilluk songs.

Speaker input variability does not explain why larger populations have simpler languages: raw data for Experiments 1 and 2. Languages spoken by more people appear to be structurally more simple, but it is not clear why this would be the case. This study investigates one possible explanation. It has been proposed that learning in a larger community results in a learner receiving their input from a greater number of speakers. This will increase the variability of the input, and we test the proposal that this in turn may make more complex grammatical features more difficult to transfer from generation to generation. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-09T15:03:57Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/706\"> <title>MaryBodhiAkany_songNyibodoYouthSong</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/706</link> <description>MaryBodhiAkany_songNyibodoYouthSong The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

Chief Awaakjok was the chief of Papwojo Village in Tonga District. Awaakjok was the chief during the first war (1955-1972), and he protected Papwojo during that war. When the second war came (1983-2005), Papwojo was burnt by the Arabs, so the composer says that if Awaakjok had been there, he would not allow this to happen. Chief Awaagjok was like a king; because Papwojo is bordering Nuba to the north, Dinka to the west and Nuer to the south; all these people come to the Shilluk land in the dry season. They take permission from the chief of Papwojo who reports to the paramount chief of Tonga, who in turn reports to the king. The Kwa-othuro clan are in-charge of the oak tree. The Shilluk make boats and drums out of that hard tree, and nobody can cut the tree without permission from the Kwa-\\ufffd\\ufffdthuro clan. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T10:39:19Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/703\"> <title>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songTheBoatOfTheArab</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/703</link> <description>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songTheBoatOfTheArab The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. A boat carrying army went from Malakal to Akorwa in Mwomo in July 1965, and took every good thing into the boat. Then the army burnt the shrine, and Akorwa Village. The boat caught fire on its way to Malakal, and sank in front of Odaango Village. So, King Kur went to Omdurman to complain to the Imam of Ansar for destroying their religious and cultural sites. Then the two leaders went to the government to complain. The government stopped forcing the people to become muslims in the south. Joseph Nyayang, the composer was in Bur Village when Nyikango\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds shrine in Akorwa was burnt. So, he was tempted to compose a song about the incident, but he resisted the idea because he is a Christian and did not want to compose songs about Nyikango. Then he became very ill and lost the taste of everything (his grain beer became dirty). He became so weak that he gave in and went to the centre of the village and started singing this song; he thought that Nyikango was angry with him because he didn't want to sing the song that came to him concerning the incident. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T10:35:27Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/702\"> <title>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songAjyangAndAkic</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/702</link> <description>GeorgeAgyethDaak_songAjyangAndAkic The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

The informants were Shilluks; they guided the Arabs and gave information about individuals or villages that have welcomed the Anya Nya. Those who took the army to Detwok were Shilluks. Each of them used to be given a sack of dura after every betrayal. They killed people, burned villages and shrines for just one sack of dura. Ajyag and Akic were not afraid to face death in defense of their village; they were like a shelter. The educated South Sudanese were targeted and killed, but all the teachers and officials who had no relations with Anya Nya, were exiled to Northern Sudan. The composer predicted that the Arabs will go and the exiled children of God will come back home; this is what happened in 1972 after the Addis Agreement. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-28T10:31:43Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/688\"> <title>AmaliaAyulDeng_songVisitingKingKwongo</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/688</link> <description>AmaliaAyulDeng_songVisitingKingKwongo The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

The bull's colour is like that of leopard 'kwec'. His Christian name is Mariano. All these names are mentioned in this song. He was the only teacher from Nyibodo at his time. The composer says: Now that he is dead, nobody in Nyibody will read any book/letter sent to the chief, or to anybody in the village. Abinykwec son of Ayoker was an evangelist and taught in village school. He was humble and a man of vision. The song mixes Christian and traditional beliefs, and this is very unusual; the song calls Shilluk land as: land of Nyikango and land of God Almighty. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-05T15:41:12Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/682\"> <title>AmaliaAyulDeng_songTheBuffaloOfTakamol</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/682</link> <description>AmaliaAyulDeng_songTheBuffaloOfTakamol The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

This song was the first for the women of Takamol. It was composed for the purpose of going to beg for a cow from Otwongo Jwaj in Takamol in 1992. The women needed a bull for their first celebration. They went to Otwongo house and spent the night, singing and dancing.

Marching songs are about the courage and strength of a village or a group.  They are warriors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd songs that are sung when people are marching for war, or going to fight a fierce animal like a lion, elephant or leopard. People had no guns, so when an animal killed a cow, people start a war call, and everybody runs there with his shield and spears. Men from nearby villages come running. When all the people arrive, they divide themselves into smaller groups. And go to attack the animal that will be hiding in the grass. This Pakang Marching Song is about a lion that ate a cow near the village and then went away into the Forest of Abayo. Then Pakang and Obay villages decided to follow the lion. They followed its foot-prints in the ashes of the burnt grass. When they found it in Abayo Forest, the fighting began; the lion wounded many people from the two villages, but they killed it.  Pakang and its neighbour Obay, were enemies, but they went together to fight with the lion. So, the composer called the two villages \"\\ufffd\\ufffdgag\" crow that ate the lion. And nobody will separate them after that war with the lion. True, Pakang and Obay remained friends since that time; 1917 which was the first year of King Gwang in power. </description> <dc:date>2014-12-18T17:11:41Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/676\"> <title>PeterPaulinoTwong_songKebDanceOfPakang</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/676</link> <description>PeterPaulinoTwong_songKebDanceOfPakang The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

The Mahdists entered Khartoum on 28 January 1885.  And the Mahdi declared an Islamic State with its capital in Omdurman. Mahdi died in June the same year and Khalifa Abdalla took over. Khalifa Abdalla sent Al-Zaki Thamal to convert the Shilluk people to Islam in 1890. King Yor Akoc welcomed him. Al-Zaki was very happy and went back to tell the Khalifa that the Shilluk people accepted the Islam and will pay taxes. King Yor did not order the Shilluk to become muslims but to be ready to fight the Mahdists when they come back in the following year. Al-Zaki came back and the Shilluk fought with him. He killed many people because he had guns. The fighting started in Kodok. Some of the Shilluk villages did not fight well, so the Shilluk king was pushed to the south until he reached Tonga. This song is telling how some villages conspired with the enemy to kill the people of Dibalo, which is part of Nyibanyo, within the Tonga cluster of villages. The conspiring villages sent a message to the people of Dibalo that Al-Zaki, the Mahdist leader says that people should go to Chief Gokwec for safety. And people went to Gokwec Village. But when Al-Zaki entered that village (the village of Chief Gokwec) in March 1892, he killed all the people. King Yor Akoc surrendered after the Dibalo massacre. He was led to Kodok and was killed. Then Al-Zaki declared Kur Nyidhok, whom he brought from El-Obeid, as the Shilluk King. Then he went back to Omdurman. But he could not come back as he promised, because the British returned to the Sudan in 1896 with Horatio Kitchener as commander of the Anglo-Egyptian army. He defeated the Mahdists in the battle of Karari on September 2, 1898. After Al-Zaki\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds departure, the elders took prince Kur to the river and ordered him to take bath. When he took off his clothes, they saw that he was not circumcised, so he was accepted as King. </description> <dc:date>2014-11-10T15:18:16Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/650\"> <title>NyadhongoTwongObany_songKingKwongo</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/650</link> <description>NyadhongoTwongObany_songKingKwongo The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

The song says that those who oppose Kwongo are just like a crocodile that lives in seasonal river, and cannot come to the Nile. </description> <dc:date>2014-11-10T15:10:47Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/641\"> <title>AndrewWanhMayik_songEnergeticDance</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/641</link> <description>AndrewWanhMayik_songEnergeticDance The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

Dh\\ufffd\\ufffdgalal won the girls. The magic of the other group did work. So, in this song, both the young men and the girls made fun of them, saying that their magic has become rotten like a rope, and that they were as dirty as the Hadandawa. </description> <dc:date>2014-10-29T15:41:37Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/640\"> <title>AndrewWanhMayik_songYouWouldHaveBeenMarried</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/640</link> <description>AndrewWanhMayik_songYouWouldHaveBeenMarried The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

They can also seek to win girls from another village if they outnumber the girls with whom they dance. The young men must first try to win the leader of the girls, who will talk to the girls and convince them to accept the young men as their dancing mates. In this song, the leader of the girls accepted to dance with Dh\\ufffd\\ufffdgalal youth, because she thought that she would be married. But she did not satisfy the young men; the result was this insulting song which says to the girl: our rich family would have married you, but we are sorry. We know that your family also expected that we could marry you, but now they are crying that cows went away, because we found out that you are an arrogant girl and you are ugly. </description> <dc:date>2014-10-29T15:34:28Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/639\"> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songJalabias</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/639</link> <description>OttoGwadoAyoker_songJalabias The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. The composer of this song is Amon Tuk Kaal, from Oryang Village, in Mwomo District in the far north. He he was jailed by the Chief of Mwomo for burning the grass in Mwomo plains and dividing it among the people who wanted to cultivate, including non-Shilluks.  And when King Kur (1951-1974) went to Mwomo on a visit,Tuk Kaal presented his case in a song which he called Ogwal \\ufffd\\ufffdmag yi Ogwal, which means A Frog Caught A Frog\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd [NB That song is also part of the Collection of Shilluk narratives and songs, performed by Owacci Obwonyo Anay.] The King then released him. Tuk Kaal did not stay in his village after he was released. He was afraid of the chief. So, he went to live in Melut, on the eastern side of the Nile. There in Melut, he became a Muslim. Tuk Kaal was a composer, and his song, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdogwal \\ufffd\\ufffdmag yi ogwal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd made him very popular indeed, because he was encouraging agriculture. [NB That song is also part of the Collection of Shilluk narratives and songs, performed by Owacci Obwonyo Anay - http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/543.] He made a mistake by becoming a Muslim. When one becomes a Muslim, he/she must change his/her way of life, and be dressed in jalabia. The composer in this song is urging the Shilluks not to wear the law\\ufffd\\ufffd, especially the '\\ufffd\\ufffdwaangkaaj\\ufffd\\ufffd'.  '\\ufffd\\ufffdwaangkaaj\\ufffd\\ufffd'  is a (law\\ufffd\\ufffd) cloth worn on the shoulder but it is not big enough to cover the whole body. Shilluk people fought with the Arab Muslims for a long time because they do not accept Islam. Shilluk even consider a circumcised person as defiled. Tuk Kaal became a caller (the man who shouts calling Muslims for prayers) but he failed to convert any Shilluk man to Islam. He made a sharp turn from good to worse. The Shilluk people did not forgive him although he composed songs in which he says that it was a mistake for him to accept circumcision. </description> <dc:date>2014-10-13T12:14:06Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/638\"> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForKingKur3</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/638</link> <description>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForKingKur3 The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk funeral song. King Kur (1951-1974), was also called Along and Nyibek. He is the son of King Gwang (1917-1944). Kur was a peaceful king, who did justice to everyone. He was loved by all the Shilluk people. So, when he died, people cried for him. Ayik Longo, the composer in this song says that he praises Nyikango and his son Daak, for Kur. And he says that those who were depending on the dead king must work hard. To the Pad\\ufffd\\ufffdw\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt, The Electoral Council, the composer tells them that the King is gone and they remained. But they must see to it that the successor of King Kur is like him; meaning that they should elect a good king who will continue his policy. If they choose a good king, they are going forward, but if you choose a bad king, they are going backward. The composer also says that he can only pray to Nyikango because the land became bad after Kur\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds sad demise. The expression of twara w\\ufffd\\ufffdl \"I sweep straw\": refers to the act of begging. When one goes to beg something from a person (a goat or a cow) the person who begs usually goes and sweeps in front of the owner\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds cattle byre with his hands. Then s/he will come and ask the owner what s/he wants. So, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdto sweep straw\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is begging.

There is no term for the word sickness or illness in Shilluk. That is because long ago, people look for causes of illness. Diarrhoea and flu have names. Diarrhoea is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdth\\ufffd\\ufffdwi c\\ufffd\\ufffdn/death of intestines\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and flu is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdngong\\ufffd\\ufffd.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd  For the other illness like dysentery or fever, they think that the person is bewitched. So, if an ordinary person is ill, it is said that his/her body is painful, if it were not diarrhoea or flu. But if the person is a king, chief or elder, people say he/she has flu, even if there is no real flu. That is because people think that such people can\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt be bewitched. When Christianity came to the land, people stopped accusing witchcraft and say that there is something unknown in the body. The word for the un-known is \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdjw\\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. So, people say \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdree da jw\\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd he/she has something un-known in his/her body. At present, sick people are taken to hospitals, where every disease has a name. But \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdjw\\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is used for sickness in general. When a person is sick for a long time it is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbud\\ufffd\\ufffd/lying down\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd like in this story. Maria was sick for a long time. She was shocked by the thing that she saw in the farm. That was the cause of her illness, which was followed by the itchy rash. In the second part, she tells another story; about bilharzia which she got in Kilo Kams\\ufffd\\ufffd in Northern Upper Nile. </description> <dc:date>2014-09-16T14:47:27Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/622\"> <title>PeterAthyeyObat_songFuneralSongForAloker</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/622</link> <description>PeterAthyeyObat_songFuneralSongForAloker The recording at the center of this item is a funeral song for Chief Aloker, the chief of Adodo, in Dhothim District.

Cultivation (agriculture) is a major activity for the Shilluk people. Almost all the Shilluk land is fertile with good rain fall. Villagers do primitive farming using very simple hand tools. They produce a small amount of dura that is sometimes less than what they need. Only a few people produce more than what they need and exchange it for cows. Shilluk cultivate three types of dura: 1. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLwall\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd red dura which is cultivated near the village. It takes three months to ripen. So, people start eating it in August.  The new grain, once dry, is planted in its turn, yielding a harvest in December. So, some people cultivate the red dura twice a year. In some areas, red dura and maize are now cultivated far inland because the children who would look after the cows go to schools. 2. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThur\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd brown dura is cultivated in the forest. It is harvested in October. 3. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgono\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd yellow dura is cultivated far from the village. It ripens very late in December. Usually people start planting lwalli and then go to plant thuro or agono. </description> <dc:date>2014-09-05T10:52:11Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/615\"> <title>AmondingOttoGwado_RabbitAndCrocodile</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/615</link> <description>AmondingOttoGwado_RabbitAndCrocodile The recording at the center of this item is an animal fable, narrated by a child. Fables are used in teaching the children about many things and how to behave in different situations. Elders like grandparents tell fables to children usually after supper. And after telling a story a second or third time, the grandfather/grandmother would ask the children to retell it. So, they are not just telling the stories, but they teach the children to learn them by heart. In this story, Rabbit goes to visit his sister who is married to Crocodile. When his sister went to the forest (to bring firewood), Rabbit boiled some of her children and ate them. And when the sister came back from the forest, she found that Rabbit has eaten her children. Rabbit had to run fast so that the Crocodile takes him to the other side of the river, (to his home). The Crocodile took Rabbit to the other side, on his back, because he did not know that Rabbit ate his children. Rabbit was almost on the other side when Crocodile was able to hear his wife, but it was too late. And Rabbit fooled him until he got to dry land. In the end, Rabbit killed many crocodiles. </description> <dc:date>2014-08-19T11:51:03Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/614\"> <title>AkwaciOttoGwado_Nyagul</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/614</link> <description>AkwaciOttoGwado_Nyagul The recording at the center of this item is an animal fable, created by a teenager.

Nyikango son of Okwa became angry, when Okwa chose his half brother Diwaat to take power (the skin) after him. So, after the death of Okwa, Diwaat became chief. Nyikango decided to leave. And people divided themselves. When he left, the elders who supported him walked away with him, they were Jur son of Okwa, and Milo son of Okwa. And two close relatives: Gilo and Jiw. Nyikango went to Thuro, his father-in-law. But he also quarrelled with Thuro and decided to go and look for a land. He went towards the north, following River Bahr El Gezal. Daak his son who remained behind went after them. Then they came to a land, and Nyikango called the first village in which he stayed \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdPapwojo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd the village of thanks giving. Daak was leading the fighters and capturing the land which was inhabited by Funj, until he took the land that is now Shilluk Land. It was in 1690, when Tugo Dhokodh founded Pachodo, he called all the head of clans to Pachodo. He gave them clans\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd names, dues and duties. Tugo was very careful not to give the names of the elders who opposed Nyikango during the period of nation building to their descendants. So, to Jur and Milo descendant\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds he gave the name of their sons Ojwok and Ojulo respectively.  But to descendants of Jiw, he gave the clan to his daughter, Apwodho. Not to his son because Okwer had quarrelled with Nyikango in Nyibodo. Tugo said: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCall them \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdKwawaang\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd descendants of their guardian grandmother.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The Kwawaang were given authority over the hippo.

Fofak Bay is situated on the north coast of Waigeo. In the last century, there have been three settlements located there: first Lamlam, then Paput, and finally Kapadiri. MW first explains how Lamlam was founded, and how it got its name: two men from the Fiay clan put out a big fire there using scoops (which in Ambel are called 'kelamlu'). He explains that in the 1930s, an American evangelist came to the village, and asked to stay there to teach the population about the Bible. He was sent away, and he cursed the village, so nearly everyone died. The villages set up a new village in Fofak Bay, Paput, to escape the curse. In 1951, another evangelist visited, and this time the people of Fofak Bay converted to Christianity. By this time, Paput was too small, so the villagers moved to what is now Kapadiri. MW explains who performed the opening ceremonies for the village, and lists the people who have been heads of Kapadiri since it was founded, including his own father, Bapak Markus Wakaf. </description> <dc:date>2014-07-08T16:24:37Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/558\"> <title>NyayejoCyanAyul_songTheBullOfHonour</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/558</link> <description>NyayejoCyanAyul_songTheBullOfHonour The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. The dowry is ten cows. But after some years, if the married girl settles well in her new home, an extra bull is given to her parents. But the extended family of her husband must say that they are happy with her. The bull is decorated and a big bell is tied on its neck. The whole village take the bull and some other gifts like goats, spears and money to the girl\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds parents. The parents of the girl make beer for their in-laws. The occasion is called \"thy\\ufffd\\ufffdk\". Thy\\ufffd\\ufffdg is a big feast. After thy\\ufffd\\ufffdk, the two families are united. In this song, the composer is warning the mothers that they must discipline their daughters, so that they get the eleventh bull. And if the girls are not respecting their husbands, then the last bull will not go to their parents. The person named early on in the song, Pan Nyang, is the composer, Thabo Lapan.

The father of the girls is more understanding than the mother, maybe because he expects the young men to marry from his daughters. The young men dance with the girls at the nearby village of Thwolong, which suggests that the girls\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd village is not far from Yony.

This song begins with a complaint from the composer that the dancing mates did not come to Dur, where they are waiting for them. But the leader of the girls replied that they have already come. Then the composer applauds their handsome dancing mates who are from Ongeli in Wadajwok. She also says that they, the girls, really match those dancers. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdWej\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd refers to a song genre in which one enumerates the good things about somebody or a group of people, beginning from what is seen to what is next to it, until you reach the best thing in the center. The word comes from taking out the layers out of maize beginning from the ones outside until you reach the corn. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-04T09:57:44Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/555\"> <title>NyakothWanhAdor_songAFlagBroughtFromEgypt</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/555</link> <description>NyakothWanhAdor_songAFlagBroughtFromEgypt The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. The Shilluk Kingdom has no particular flag that stands as its symbol. But each village has its flag. In one village, there can be a flag for men and another for women of the same age-group. Older flags are also displayed in big occasions. This song implies that the women of Obay Aboj\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdb\\ufffd\\ufffd were not pleased with their flag.  So, they said to their leader that the flag must be changed at the end of the year. At the end of that year, they brought a flag from Egypt. The flag from Egypt was good and they liked it. After getting a beautiful flag, they want to pay homage to the King in his village, \\ufffd\\ufffdl\\ufffd\\ufffdki. And because the women were not happy before, they must be reconciled. So, they went to the elder woman in her house to bless them before they go to \\ufffd\\ufffdl\\ufffd\\ufffdki. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-04T09:55:01Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/554\"> <title>NyaryemiAnyangNyikango_songFlag</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/554</link> <description>NyaryemiAnyangNyikango_songFlag The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. In this song, the composer applauds the Lul Agw\\ufffd\\ufffdj women\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds flag. She also says that the flag was designed; it was not a ready-made flag. Lul women in the village sent a letter and money to daughter of Nyibong, who was in Malakal Town. She is from their village. The women asked her to buy the materials and make a flag. She made a beautiful flag, with the picture of crocodile and rainbow.  The lady in the town kept the flag until the women went to see it. The women of the village did not go to Khartoum, but they sent representatives who took the flag to the women of their village who were in Khartoum. Shilluk people of the same village share all the matters concerning the clan. And women of the same village have one group name wherever they may be. They consider themselves as one entity. </description> <dc:date>2014-06-04T09:51:54Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/553\"> <title>NyadhongoTwongObany_songAlaki</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/553</link> <description>NyadhongoTwongObany_songAlaki The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Alaki is the village of King Kwongo Daak, the present King of the Shilluk. The Shilluk King is considered to be of his maternal uncles\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd village. And after his installation, he is expected to builds his village in the area that belongs to his maternal uncles. But King Kwongo decided not to build his village in Wadajwok from which hailed his mother. He built it in Thworo and called it Alaki. The composer is saying that the customary law must be changed in order to allow the king to build anywhere. And that Nyikango and Daak his son will have no objection if any king decides not to build his village in the area of his maternal uncles. </description> <dc:date>2014-05-19T16:39:56Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/552\"> <title>BolAwangNyiker_songWijrek</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/552</link> <description>BolAwangNyiker_songWijrek The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song. Wijrek had no paramount chief before King Ayang. They kept complaining that they should not be part of Pachodo area in \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdG\\ufffd\\ufffdr\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, because G\\ufffd\\ufffdr is too big and they are even far from Pachodo. King Ayang in 1978 upgraded Wijrek and appointed a paramount chief for it. In the song, this is expressed as that Wijrek \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfound a gourd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The gourd is a literally container. But when you give somebody something to eat, it is said that you gave him a gourd, that is food. This image relates to the fact that paramount chiefs share wealth in Pachodo, that means they have the right to recommend anybody from their area for support from \"bwori mac\", the common wealth. And also when a king gives, people say Nyikango gave. King Ayang appointed a paramount chief for Wijrek, so they became a district and not part of Pachodo anymore; now they have their rights and duties. In this song, the composer who is also from Wijrek is thanking King Ayang for upgrading Wijrek into a district. And he says that those who think Wijrek is weak are wrong. Wijrek is independent and strong. Lwak means \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmultitude\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, but also refers to the region Wijrek feels associated with (rather than G\\ufffd\\ufffdr). </description> <dc:date>2014-05-19T16:37:42Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/551\"> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForAmaylek</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/551</link> <description>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForAmaylek The recording at the center of this item is a funeral song. Amaylek was a paramount chief of Tonga. He ruled in a difficult time of famines; during the reign of King Gwang (1917-1944). He was a just chief and very hospitable, and taking care of orphans. Even Nuer people used to come from across the River Nile bringing their disputes to him for settlement. </description> <dc:date>2014-05-19T16:15:07Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/550\"> <title>AnguyAdyengLwal_songPadhyangCultivated</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/550</link> <description>AnguyAdyengLwal_songPadhyangCultivated The recording at the center of this item is a song. There was famine in some areas in the northern Shilluk \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdG\\ufffd\\ufffdr\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the year 1985. And many people left their villages and went to the north looking for food. Some villages were deserted. Padhyang Village was not affected much by the famine, because it has big farms in the forest. Moreover, Padhyang had a farm for King Ayang Anay. In this song, the composer asks King Ayang to bring back those who left their villages and put them in prison, because the shrines are falling down. Then he challenges the people of Pachodo area; he says that King Ayang is a glorious king but you, the people of Pachodo area, you are lazy. You just sit by his side and you are not cultivating. But the people of Padhyang come to the King carrying the dura that they planted for him. </description> <dc:date>2014-05-19T16:08:34Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/549\"> <title>AnguyAdyengLwal_songInstallationOfKwongo</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/549</link> <description>AnguyAdyengLwal_songInstallationOfKwongo The recording at the center of this item is a song. Kwongo Daak was elected as Shilluk King in 1992. Before the installation, he rebuilt the former kings\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd shrines as required by the Shilluk norms. Then he went to Pachodo by boat. There is no river port in Pachodo. So the boat must proceed to Kodok and then he takes a care from Kodok to Pachodo. The composer appreciates the new king and is happy because he has done what was necessary in regard to all the shrines. And he wishes that the new king would rule for forty years, like King Yor Nyakwacci. He is also expecting his time to be hunger free as it was during the reign of his fathers. In the end he says that the educated King will protect the Shilluk Land. </description> <dc:date>2014-05-19T16:04:43Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/548\"> <title>AnguyAdyengLwal_songAmagag</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/548</link> <description>AnguyAdyengLwal_songAmagag The recording at the center of this item is a song. Amagag comes after keb dance. Keb is a dance in which people dance in very big circles. There is no drum but the person who leads the song must have a strong voice, sometimes the song is led by two people. When people become tired of dancing keb, they sit down in a wide circle and amagag begins. In amagag people clap their hands as they sing. And a number of girls go to choose the men to dance with in the circle. When they are tired, they come and sit, and a new group goes to dance. When amagag songs are finished or the people are tired, they disperse. In this song, the composer is encouraging his group of Padhyang Village to go and look for girls with whom they will dance, after they lost their dancing mates. He blames some people from their group who do not dance well for the lost dancing mates. They were accepted by the girls of Alwiy in Lul area. Lul is far from Padhyang, the villages between Padhyang and Lul to the south are: Golbangyo, Nyigir, Pachodo and Kwom. The composer and his friend think that they made it because they are handsome with perfect white teeth, and they are educated. They are also feeling proud because they did not use any witchcraft for that purpose. </description> <dc:date>2014-05-19T15:59:27Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
