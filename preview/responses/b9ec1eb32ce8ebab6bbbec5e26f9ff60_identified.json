It is also possible that the extended lifetime of one mission using nuclear power could provide more science value for money.</p> <p>The University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds involvement in the project is being led by Dr Richard Ambrosi, Dr Hugo Williams and Dr Nigel Bannister of the Space Research Centre.</p> <p>So far, coverage has appeared in the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2ea069f2-f830-11e1-828f-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F2ea069f2-f830-11e1-828f-00144feabdc0.html&amp;_i_referer=#axzz28KxRHlM3\">Financial Times </a>and the<a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Science/article1137100.ece\"> Sunday Times </a>(the article is behind a paywall).</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>uatemp13</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Space Research Centre</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-10-05T15:40:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/may/2018from-big-bang-to-biospheres2019-astronomer-royal2019s-public-lecture-on-wednesday-16-may\">     <title>\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFrom Big Bang to Biospheres\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd: Astronomer Royal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds public lecture on Wednesday 16 May</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/may/2018from-big-bang-to-biospheres2019-astronomer-royal2019s-public-lecture-on-wednesday-16-may</link>     <description>Professor Martin Rees asks: How widespread is life in the cosmos?</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Astronomer Royal Martin Rees (formally, Baron Rees of Ludlow) visits the University on Wednesday to deliver the annual Haldane Society Public Lecture. In his talk \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdFrom Big Bang to Biospheres\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, the former President of the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://royalsociety.org/\">Royal Society</a> will discuss the question of extraterrestrial life.</p> <p>Should we be surprised that the physical laws have permitted the emergence of complexity of which we are part? Is physical reality even more extensive than the domain our telescopes can probe? Advances in technology mean astronomers have made astonishing progress in probing and understanding our cosmic environment, but they also raise new questions.</p> <p>We can trace cosmic history from some mysterious 'beginning' nearly 14 billion years ago. We understand in outline how atoms, galaxies, stars and planets emerged. And we know how, on at least one planet, life emerged and developed a complex biosphere of which we are part. But what does the long-range future hold?</p> <p>As well as being the Astronomer Royal, Martin Rees is <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/index.php?pageid=172\">Master of Trinity College</a>, Cambridge and a visiting Professor at Imperial College London. He was appointed to the House of Lords in 2005. He is the author of more than 500 scientific papers and numerous books including the acclaimed <em>Just Six Numbers: The Deep Forces That Shape the Universe</em>. And Asteroid 4587 is named after him.</p> <p>The lecture, which is free and open to the public, will take place in the Ken Edwards Building, Lecture Theatre 1, at 6.00pm on Wednesday 16 May 2012 and will be followed by a wine reception in the Charles Wilson Building.</p> <p>The <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/institution/societies/haldane\" title=\"Haldane\">Haldane Society</a>, hosted by the University of Leicester was established almost half a century ago as a meeting place for \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtown and gown\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. Its purpose is to hear distinguished speakers address topics drawn from a wide range of subjects, but always involving the boundary between academic study and practical, everyday concerns.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Public lecture</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-05-11T16:11:36Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/honorary-graduate-videos-online\">     <title>Honorary Graduate videos online</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/honorary-graduate-videos-online</link>     <description>Orations for, and responses by, Biddy Baxter and Nigel Henbest.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>At last week\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Graduation Ceremonies we gave Honorary Degrees to <em>Blue Peter</em> producer Biddy Baxter (who was born in Leicester) and science writer/astronomer Nigel Henbest (who took his BSc here).</p> <p>We now have online videos for each of our Honorary Graduates; the first half of each 12-minute clip is an oration by a senior academic describing the person\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds work, then the Honorary Graduate gives a speech in response.</p> <p>For videos of previous Honorary Graduates, including Desmond Tutu, Terry Wogan and Patrick Moore, visit our <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8DE3E07CD1DF4C0F&amp;feature=plcp\">YouTube Channel</a>.</p> <h2>Biddy Baxter: oration and response</h2> <iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xaTX73AXhV0?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></iframe> <ul><li>&nbsp;<a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/honorary-graduates-no.1-2013-biddy-baxter\" title=\"Honorary Graduates no.1 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Biddy Baxter\">Honorary Graduates no.1: Biddy Baxter</a>&nbsp;</li></ul> <h2>Nigel Henbest: oration and response</h2> <iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kfP4YsGRu20?feature=player_detailpage\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"auto\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\"></iframe> <ul><li><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/honorary-graduates-no.2-2013-nigel-henbest\" title=\"Honorary Graduates No.2 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Nigel Henbest\">Honorary Graduates no.2: Nigel Henbest</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Television</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Honorary graduates</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-02-03T09:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/honorary-graduates-no.2-2013-nigel-henbest\">     <title>Honorary Graduates No.2 \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Nigel Henbest</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/honorary-graduates-no.2-2013-nigel-henbest</link>     <description>Leicester astronomy alumnus with a ticket for space.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>It\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds been a busy old week for astronomy in Leicester. Here at the University, we presented <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2012/january/stars-in-our-eyes-four-astronomy-lectures-in-one-week\" title=\"Stars in our eyes: four astronomy public lectures in one week!\">four public lectures on astronomy</a>, three of them tied into the BBC\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/features/stargazing\">Stargazing Live</a> event. Over at the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.spacecentre.co.uk/\">National Space Centre</a>, Sir Patrick Moore (an old friend of ours who is a <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/ebulletin/news/2000-2009/2008/06/npfolder.2008-06-11.2148853213/nparticle.2008-05-08.0157645714/\">Distinguished Honorary Fellow</a> and a <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://leicesterexchanges.com/2011/02/16/onward-to-mars/\">contributor to our Leicester Exchanges site</a>) officially opened the Sir Patrick Moore Planetarium. At the start of the week, astronomers were squinting Northwards hoping for a glimpse of an unusually strong Aurora borealis (unsuccessfully, alas). And today, Nigel Henbest picks up an Honorary Degree at De Montfort Hall.</p> <p>Born in Manchester, raised in Belfast, Nigel studied <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics\" title=\"Physics And Astronomy\">Astrophysics</a> here at Leiceter where he met Heather Couper, forming a lifelong friendship which would produce innumerable books and television programmes about space and astronomy. In fact, his first published article was in the newsletter of the University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Physics Society.</p> <p>After postgraduate study at Cambridge, he returned to Leicester to help with the development and installation of equipment to monitor the Sicilian volcano Mount Etna. In the days before GPS, Henbest navigated his Landrover across Europe using <em>The World Atlas of Wine</em>!</p> <p>Together with Heather Couper and Stuart Carter, Nigel Henbest set up <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.pioneertv.com/\">Pioneer Productions</a> to make science programming. Over the years he has written nearly 40 books and hundreds of magazine articles (and a stage play) about astronomy. He has been Astronomy Consultant to <em><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/\">New Scientist</a></em>, Media Consultant to the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.rmg.co.uk/royal-observatory\">Royal Greenwich Observatory</a>, Editor of the <em><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.britastro.org/journal\">Journal of the British Astronomical Association</a></em>, Chairman of <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.astronomyweek.org.uk/\">National Astronomy Week</a> and External Assessor on Astronomy to the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/\">Open University</a>.</p> <p>Last March, Nigel and Heather - who now run the media science consultancy <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.hencoup.com/\">Hencoup Enterprises</a> -&nbsp;came back to Leicester to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2011-archive/march/astronomical-history\" title=\"Couper on Copernicus, Henbest talks Herschel: Public lecture on astronomical history\">present the annual Alumni Lecture</a>. Heather already has an Honorary Doctorate of Science, awarded in 1994. Nigel collects his this afternoon in the 4.00pm Graduation Ceremony.</p> <p>And in less than two years' time, all being well, Nigel should finally make it into space for real, having already bought a ticket for the Virgin Galactic spaceship!</p> <ul><li><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2012/january/science-writer-and-2018blue-peter2019-editor-honoured\" title=\"Science writer and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdBlue Peter\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd editor honoured\">University press release</a></li></ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>mjs76</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Honorary graduates</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-27T10:20:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
