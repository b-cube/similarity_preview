(2012) method. The aim of&#xD; this investigation is to assess the applicability of this type of observations for the routine implementation of the method. According&#xD; to the results extracted from the analysis presented here, about half of COSMIC IRO EDP observed under solar minimum&#xD; (2007\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2008) conditions gave neutral gas density with an inaccuracy close to the declared absolute inaccuracy \\ufffd\\ufffd(10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd15)% of&#xD; CHAMP observations, with the results being better than the empirical models JB-2008 and MSISE-00 provide. For the other half&#xD; of IRO EDP, either the solution provided by the method had to be rejected due to insufficient accuracy or no solution could be&#xD; obtained. For these cases, the parameters foF2 and hmF2 extracted from the corresponding IRO profiles have been found to be&#xD; inconsistent with the classic mid-latitude daytime F2-layer formalism that the method relies on, and they are incompatible with&#xD; the general trend provided by the IRI model. For solar maximum conditions (2002) the method was tested with IRO EDP from&#xD; CHAMP and it is indicated that its performance is quite stable in the sense that a solution could be obtained for all the cases&#xD; analyzed here. However available CHAMP EDP are confined by ~ 400 km in altitude and this might be the reason for the&#xD; 20% bias of the retrieved densities toward larger values in respect to the observed densities. IRO observations up to 600 km under&#xD; solar maximum are required to confirm the exact performance of the method.</description>     <dc:date>2014-02-27T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9104\">     <title>The calculation of ionospheric absorption with modern computers</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9104</link>     <description>Title: The calculation of ionospheric absorption with modern computers Authors: Scotto, C.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Settimi, A.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: New outcomes are proposed for ionospheric absorption starting from the Appleton-Hartree formula, in its complete form. The range of applicability is discussed for the approximate formulae, which are usually employed in the calculation of non-deviative absorption coefficient. These results were achieved by performing a more refined approximation that is valid under quasi-longitudinal (QL) propagation conditions. The more refined QL approximation and the usually employed non-deviative absorption are compared with that derived from a complete formulation. Their expressions, nothing complicated, can usefully be implemented in a software program running on modern computers. Moreover, the importance of considering Booker\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds rule is highlighted. A radio link of ground range D = 1000 km was also simulated using ray tracing for a sample daytime ionosphere. Finally, some estimations of the integrated absorption for the radio link considered are provided for different frequencies.</description>     <dc:date>2014-10-14T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8864\">     <title>The COMPLEIK subroutine of the IONORT-ISP system for calculating the non-deviative absorption: A comparison with the ICEPAC formula</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8864</link>     <description>Title: The COMPLEIK subroutine of the IONORT-ISP system for calculating the non-deviative absorption: A comparison with the ICEPAC formula Authors: Settimi, A.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Pietrella, M.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Pezzopane, M.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Zolesi, B.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Bianchi, C.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Scotto, C.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: The present paper proposes to discuss the ionospheric absorption, assuming a quasi-flat layered ionospheric medium, with small horizontal gradients. A recent complex eikonal model [Settimi et al., 2013b] is applied, useful to calculate the absorption due to the ionospheric D-layer, which can be approximately characterized by a linearized analytical profile of complex refractive index, covering a short range of heights between h1= 50 km and h2= 90 km. Moreover, Settimi et al. [2013c] have already compared the complex eikonal model for the D-layer with the analytical Chapman\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds profile of ionospheric electron density; the corresponding absorption coefficient is more accurate than Rawer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds theory [1976] in the range of middle critical frequencies. Finally, in this paper, the simple complex eikonal equations, in quasi-longitudinal (QL) approximation, for calculating the non-deviative absorption coefficient due to the propagation across the D-layer are encoded into a so called COMPLEIK (COMPLex EIKonal) subroutine of the IONORT (IONOspheric Ray-Tracing) program [Azzarone et al., 2012]. The IONORT program, which simulates the three-dimensional (3-D) ray-tracing for high frequencies (HF) waves in the ionosphere, runs on the assimilative ISP (IRI-SIRMUP-P) discrete model over the Mediterranean area [Pezzopane et al., 2011]. As main outcome of the paper, the simple COMPLEIK algorithm is compared to the more elaborate semi-empirical ICEPAC formula [Stewart, undated], which refers to various phenomenological parameters such as the critical frequency of E-layer. COMPLEIK is reliable just like the ICEPAC, with the advantage of being implemented more directly. Indeed, the complex eikonal model depends just on some parameters of the electron density profile, which are numerically calculable, such as the maximum height.</description>     <dc:date>2014-01-14T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8853\">     <title>Retrieval of thermospheric parameters from routinely observed  F2-layer Ne(h) pro\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdles at the geomagnetic equator</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8853</link>     <description>Title: Retrieval of thermospheric parameters from routinely observed  F2-layer Ne(h) pro\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdles at the geomagnetic equator Authors: Mikhailov, A.; Pushkov Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation (IZMIRAN), Troitsk, Moscow Region  142190, Russia; Belehaki, A.; Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens, Metaxa and Vas.

Pavlou, Palaia Penteli, 15236 Greece Abstract: A principal possibility to retrieve basic thermospheric parameters (neutral temperature Tex, atomic [O] and molecular [O2] oxygen as well as molecular nitrogen [N2] concentrations) from the observed daytime electron density profiles Ne(h) in the equatorial F2-region is demonstrated for the first time. The reduction of a 2D continuity equation for electron concentration in the low-latitude F2-region at the geomagnetic equator (I = 0) results in a simple 1D equation which can be efficiently solved. The method was tested using Jicamarca Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) and Digisonde Ne(h) profiles for the periods when CHAMP and GRACE neutral gas density observations are available in the vicinity of the Jicamarca Observatory. The retrieved from ISR Ne(h) neutral gas densities were shown to be close to the observed ones (MRD &lt; 10%) being within the announced absolute uncertainty (10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd15%) of the neutral gas density observations and more successful than the predictions of the empirical models JB-2008 (MRD = 32%) and MSISE-00 (MRD = 27%) for the analyzed cases. The implementation of the method with Jicamarca Digisonde Ne(h) profiles has also shown acceptable results especially for solar minimum conditions (MRD ~ 12%) and higher prediction accuracy than modern empirical models provide. This finding seems to open a way for the practical exploitation of the method for thermospheric monitoring purposes.</description>     <dc:date>2013-11-30T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8851\">     <title>Solar activity impact on the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds upper atmosphere</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/8851</link>     <description>Title: Solar activity impact on the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds upper atmosphere Authors: Kutiev, I.; National Institute of Geophysics, Geodesy and Geography, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113 So\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda, Bulgaria; Tsagouri, I.; Institute for Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens, 15236 Mount Penteli, Greece; Perrone, L.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia; Pancheva, D.; National Institute of Geophysics, Geodesy and Geography, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113 So\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda, Bulgaria; Mukhtarov, P.; National Institute of Geophysics, Geodesy and Geography, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113 So\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda, Bulgaria; Mikhailov, A.; Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Propagation, Russian Academy of Sciences, 142190 Troitsk,  Moskovskaya obl., Russia 5 Institute of Atmospheric Physics ASCR, 14131 Prague, Czech Republic 6 Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, 51147 Cologne, Germany 7 Ebro Observatory, University Ramon Llull, CSIC, E-43520 Roquetes, Spain 8 Dipartimento di Fisica, Universita` degli Studi di Roma, 00185 Rome, Italy 9 Atmospheric Sounding Station; Lastovicka, J.; Institute of Atmospheric Physics ASCR, 14131 Prague, Czech Republic; Jakowski, N.; Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center, 51147 Cologne, Germany; Buresova, D.; Institute of Atmospheric Physics ASCR, 14131 Prague, Czech Republic; Blanch, E.; Ebro Observatory, University Ramon Llull, CSIC, E-43520 Roquetes, Spain; Andonov, B.; National Institute of Geophysics, Geodesy and Geography, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113 So\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffda, Bulgaria; Altadill, D.; Ebro Observatory, University Ramon Llull, CSIC, E-43520 Roquetes, Spain; Magdaleno, S.; Atmospheric Sounding Station \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl Arenosillo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, INTA, Huelva, Spain; Parisi, M.; Dipartimento di Fisica, Universita` degli Studi di Roma, 00185 Rome, Italy; Torta, J.

V.; Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation, Troitsk, Russia; Perrone, L.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: Seasonal (winter/summer) and solar cycle NmF2 variations as well as summer saturation&#xD; effect in NmF2 have been analyzed using Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (ISR)&#xD; daytime observations. A self\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdconsistent approach to the Ne(h) modeling has been applied to&#xD; extract from ISR observations a consistent set of main aeronomic parameters and to estimate&#xD; their quantitative contribution to the observed NmF2 variations. The retrieved aeronomic&#xD; parameters are independent of uncertainties in thermosphere and solar EUV empirical&#xD; models, and this is a distinguishing feature of the present consideration. Different&#xD; temperatures in winter and in summer in the course of solar cycle overlapped on the O++N2&#xD; reaction rate coefficient temperature dependence result in different NmF2 dependences&#xD; on solar activity: a steep practically linear increase with a tendency to turn up in January&#xD; (contrary to international reference ionosphere prediction) and a slow increase with a&#xD; tendency to saturate at high solar activity in July despite increasing solar EUV irradiation.&#xD; In winter the EUV flux and thermospheric parameters provide approximately equal&#xD; contributions to the NmF2 increase, while in summer the contribution of thermospheric&#xD; parameters is small. Both in winter and in summer the variations of atomic oxygen [O] are&#xD; small at the F2 layer peak, and its contribution is small compared to linear loss coefficient, b.&#xD; It is shown that the summer saturation effect in NmF2 under high solar activity is not just&#xD; reduced to O/N2 or EUV flux solar cycle variations but is determined by b via the g1&#xD; temperature dependence. A new mechanism (qualitative) to explain the December anomaly&#xD; in NmF2 is proposed. It is based on the idea that the areas of atomic oxygen production and its&#xD; loss are spatially separated and that time is required to transfer [O] from one area to the other&#xD; where [O] associates in a three\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbody collision. Therefore, under a 7% increase in the O2&#xD; dissociation rate due to the Sun\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEarth distance decrease in December\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdJanuary compared to&#xD; June\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdJuly, an accumulation of atomic oxygen should take place in the thermosphere in the&#xD; vicinity of the December solstice resulting in a 21% NmF2 increase, which is close to the&#xD; observed global December effect.</description>     <dc:date>2011-03-17T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/5022\">     <title>Pre-storm NmF2 enhancements at middle latitudes: delusion or reality?</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/5022</link>     <description>Title: Pre-storm NmF2 enhancements at middle latitudes: delusion or reality? Authors: Mikhailov, A. V.; Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation, Troitsk, Moscow Region 142190, Russia; Perrone, L.; Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Sezione Roma2, Roma, Italia Abstract: A critical analysis of recent publications devoted&#xD; to the NmF2 pre-storm enhancements is performed.&#xD; There are no convincing arguments that the observed cases&#xD; of NmF2 enhancements at middle and sub-auroral latitudes&#xD; bear a relation to the following magnetic storms. In all cases&#xD; considered the NmF2 pre-storm enhancements were due to&#xD; previous geomagnetic storms, moderate auroral activity or&#xD; they presented the class of positive quiet time events (Q-disturbances).&#xD; Therefore, it is possible to conclude that there&#xD; is no such an effect as the pre-storm NmF2 enhancement as&#xD; a phenomenon inalienably related to the following magnetic&#xD; storm. The observed nighttime NmF2 enhancements at subauroral&#xD; latitudes may result from plasma transfer from the&#xD; plasma ring area by meridional thermospheric wind. Enhanced&#xD; plasmaspheric fluxes into the nighttime F2-region resulted&#xD; from westward substorm-associated electric fields is&#xD; another possible source of nighttime NmF2 enhancements.&#xD; Daytime positive Q-disturbances occurring under very low&#xD; geomagnetic activity level may be related to the dayside cusp&#xD; activity.</description>     <dc:date>2009-03-17T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/4165\">     <title>EFFECTS OF ENERGETIC SOLAR PARTICLES ON OZONE AND MINOR ATMOSPHERIC COMPONENTS INSIDE THE POLAR REGIONS</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/4165</link>     <description>Title: EFFECTS OF ENERGETIC SOLAR PARTICLES ON OZONE AND MINOR ATMOSPHERIC COMPONENTS INSIDE THE POLAR REGIONS Authors: Damiani, A.; INAF-IFSI Abstract: Solar activity influences the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds environment, in particular the atmospheric&#xD; ozone, by the direct output of the e.m. radiation or through the variability of the&#xD; incoming cosmic ray flux (solar and galactic particles). Especially energetic particles,&#xD; arising from huge explosions on the Sun\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds surface, travel in the interplanetary&#xD; medium and, if the circumstances were favorable, they could enter the terrestrial&#xD; atmosphere (driven by the geomagnetic field lines of our planet) and reach the polar&#xD; cap regions (geomagnetic latitude &gt; 60\\ufffd\\ufffd). There, they provide additional external&#xD; energy and are able to produce ionizations, dissociations, dissociative ionizations&#xD; and excitations phenomena by interacting with the minor constituents. The induced&#xD; changes are not confined to the ion chemistry but also to the neutral components. In&#xD; this way a rise of the concentration of HOx and NOx species and the triggering of&#xD; catalytic cycles which lead to short (hours) and medium (days) term ozone&#xD; destruction occur. Finally, also no-reactive reservoir species (e.g., HNO3, HCl, HOCl)&#xD; are involved in these processes and endure large variations.&#xD; The present thesis highlights the chemical variability of the middle atmosphere&#xD; during and after some Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events recorded during the&#xD; current solar cycle. Special attention has been paid to the relationship between&#xD; ozone and HOx data (retrieved from the Microwave Limb Sounder of EOS AURA&#xD; satellite) for four events referred to 2005. The HOx data, recorded for the first time&#xD; during the intense ionization caused by the SEP flux, have pointed out some features&#xD; related to these phenomena not wholly captured by the current theoretical models. In&#xD; addition, they have highlighted that the HOx rise is able to destroy the so-called third&#xD; ozone peak at the polar latitudes of the winter hemisphere and it occurs also during&#xD; medium intensity events. Besides, the analyses of January 2005 SEP events have&#xD; shown that the changes on the hydrogen species leaded to variability in the&#xD; concentration and partitioning of chlorine family, not discernible in the summer&#xD; hemisphere. Further, the use of data coming from the HALOE instrument, referred to&#xD; SEP events occurred in July 2000 and April 2002, has in short confirmed past&#xD; experimental results. Finally, the study of a little SEP event occurred during May 2003&#xD; has pointed out that SEP events are not the unique ionization source inside the polar&#xD; latitudes during the winter.</description>     <dc:date>2007-11-30T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/1688\">     <title>Modelling the light-ion densities in the ionosphere</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/1688</link>     <description>Title: Modelling the light-ion densities in the ionosphere Authors: Stankov, S.
