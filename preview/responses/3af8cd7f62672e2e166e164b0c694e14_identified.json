The lake basin is a relatively simple half graben, a spoon-shaped depression tilted toward the main fault on the east side of the lake. The U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with researchers from several universities, has been studying the sediments of Bear Lake since 1996. The general purpose of this effort is to reconstruct past limnological conditions and regional climate on a range of timescales, from hundreds of years to hundreds of thousands of years. This research relates to a variety of human concerns, including water usage in the Bear River basin. Past work has included several coring operations, a seismic-reflection survey, sediment-trap deployments, a barge-mounted drilling operation with the GLAD800 drill rig, and a variety of other studies. The objectives of the September, 2002 operations, preliminarily reported here, were (1) to compile a detailed bathymetric map of the lake using swath-mapping techniques, in order to provide baseline data for a variety of applications and studies, and (2) to complete a sidescan-sonar survey of the lake, providing a nearly complete acoustic image of the lake floor. Limited amounts of subbottom acoustic-reflection data (chrip) were also collected, along with samples of lake-floor sediments representative of different kinds of backscatter patterns. These surveys followed an earlier subbottom acoustic-reflection survey (1997), using boomer and 3.5 kHz systems (S. M. Colman, unpublished data). </abstract> <purpose> The bathymetric contours will be used as a reference for depth information within Bear Lake, Utah-Idaho. No bathymetric surveys have been conducted in the Lake since the 1970&apos;s. This dataset represents the most up-to-date bathymetric information for the area. </purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20020904</begdate> <enddate>20020916</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-111.5</westbc> <eastbc>-111.17</eastbc> <northbc>42.2</northbc> <southbc>41.08</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>General</themekt> <themekey>bathymetry</themekey> <themekey>swath bathymetry</themekey> <themekey>interferometry</themekey> <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey> <themekey>USGS</themekey> <themekey>Coastal and Marine Geology Program</themekey> <themekey>CMGP</themekey> <themekey>Woods Hole Field Center</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Bear Lake</placekey> <placekey>Utah</placekey> <placekey>Idaho</placekey> <placekey>Western Lakes</placekey> <placekey>North America</placekey> <placekey>United States</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None.</accconst> <useconst>Bathymetry is not to be used for navigational purposees.

All navigation data were acquired using the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), a GPS-based navigation and landing system providing precision guidance to aircraft.

All ship motion was recorded by a TSS DMS 2-05 Attitude Sensor. </vertaccr> </vertacc> </posacc> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc> Bathymetric data were corrected for variations in the speed of sound throughout the water column; sound velocity profiles were acquired at locations throughout the lake and throughout the survey period. Attitude sensor and compass information were incorporated into the header of the bathymetric data files using the SEA RTS2000 acquiistion and processing system. The resultant data files were imported into SEA GRID2000 program and gridded to a 10 meter grid cell size.  The bathymetry navigation are received by the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) GPS network, and recorded within Coastal Oceanographics Inc., Hypack navigation acquisition software and within the header of each file. The navigation reformatted into a comma-delimited ArcView Ungenerate text format.  The file is then imported into ArcView, and a vector line shapefile is generated. The line numbers for each trackline are stored in an ASCII file listing unique track ID and line number. This file is imported into ArcView 3.2 as a table. The file is then joined to the line shapefile by the unique track ID. The table for the trackline file is the editted, a new field created, the line number information written to this new field, the join removed, and the file saved.  This permantely saves the line number with the corresponding trackline. </procdesc> <procdate>20020916</procdate> <proccont> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Jane F.
