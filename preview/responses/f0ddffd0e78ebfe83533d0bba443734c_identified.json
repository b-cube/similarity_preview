Across a wide age range in the UK, nearly half the population (24 million adults) use one or more social networking sites. Information producers, librarians and users have had to come to terms, in their different ways, with the challenges posed by the exponential growth in social networking sites and the opportunities that Web 2.0 provides. The East of England ISG Spring Meeting on \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlt's a Virtual Life: exploring social networks\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd discussed the issues and examined experiences of using Web 2.0. lt was held on 17 April 2008 at BT's Adastral Park in lpswich.

A 'yes' vote will have huge financial, political and legal implications. This article, written by Candace Guite, considers the current role of the UK Supreme Court in Scotland, the recent conflict (to which the title alludes) and it reflects on Scotland's potential international status. The UK&#xD; Government has argued that it would be regarded as the continuator state and an&#xD; independent Scotland would be a successor state, and so, in the event of a 'yes' vote&#xD; Scotland would have to re-apply for entry to the European Union and the United Nations.&#xD; However, there are arguments to support the alternative option, that Scotland could be&#xD; regarded as a co-equal successor state with England, and thus would retain EU and UN&#xD; membership.</description>     <dc:date>2013-09-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
