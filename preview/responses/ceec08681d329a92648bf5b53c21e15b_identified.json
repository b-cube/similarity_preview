The primary digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle (DOQQ) is a1-meter ground resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75 minutes of latitude by 3.75 minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator projection (UTM) on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The geographic extent of the DOQQ is equivalent to a quarter-quadrangle plus the over edge ranges from a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner points. The over edge is included to facilitate tonal matching for mosaicing and for the placement of the NAD83 and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to east with the order of the lines from north to south. This series of DOQQs was produced as a part of the Arkansas Digital Orthophotography Program headed by the Arkansas State Land Information Board and the Arkansas Geographic information Office. The aerial photography used to create the digital images was flown between January 15th and March 31st in 2006.</abstract>       <purpose>Data available online through GeoStor at http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov DOQQs serve a variety of purposes, from interim maps to field references for Earth science investigations and analysis. The DOQQ is useful as a layer of a geographic information system and as a tool for mapscollecting new features and feature classes using heads-up digitizing and maintenance of existing feature classes using visual evidence of changes in the on-the-ground conditions.</purpose>       <supplinf>The 2006 digital orthos were captured with an ADS40 sensor. The State of Arkansas purchased DOQs in the RGB and CIR band combinations. This file represents the 1-meter natural color (RGB) product.</supplinf>       <langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>20060111</begdate>           <enddate>20060331</enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>ground condition</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>Irregular</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc Sync=\"TRUE\">-91.716315</westbc>         <eastbc Sync=\"TRUE\">-91.046364</eastbc>         <northbc Sync=\"TRUE\">34.569266</northbc>         <southbc Sync=\"TRUE\">33.919590</southbc>       </bounding>       <lboundng>         <leftbc Sync=\"TRUE\">618649.000000</leftbc>         <rightbc Sync=\"TRUE\">679233.000000</rightbc>         <bottombc Sync=\"TRUE\">3754933.000000</bottombc>         <topbc Sync=\"TRUE\">3826038.000000</topbc>       </lboundng>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>         <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthcover</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>Arkansas Geographic Information Office</themekt>         <themekey>DOQ</themekey>         <themekey>DOQQ</themekey>         <themekey>Aerial</themekey>         <themekey>Ortho</themekey>         <themekey>Orthos</themekey>         <themekey>Photos</themekey>         <themekey>Photography</themekey>         <themekey>Aerial</themekey>         <themekey>Doq</themekey>         <themekey>Doqq</themekey>         <themekey>FTP</themekey>         <themekey>Mr Sid</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>LCSH - Library of Congress subject headings (Washington, DC: LC, Cataloging Distribution Service)</placekt>         <placekey>United States</placekey>         <placekey>Arkansas</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>None</accconst>     <useconst>None</useconst>     <ptcontac>       <cntinfo>         <cntorgp>           <cntorg>Arkansas Geographic Information Office</cntorg>           <cntper>Learon Dalby</cntper>         </cntorgp>         <cntpos>Arkansas GIS Program Manager</cntpos>         <cntaddr>           <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>           <address>124 West Capitol, Suite 900</address>           <city>Little Rock</city>           <state>Arkansas</state>           <postal>72201</postal>           <country>USA</country>         </cntaddr>         <cntvoice>501-682-2929</cntvoice>         <cntfax>501-682-2040</cntfax>         <cntemail>learon.dalby@arkansas.gov</cntemail>         <hours>Monday - Friday 8:00 am - 5:00 pm CST</hours>       </cntinfo>     </ptcontac>     <datacred>Arkansas State Land Information Board</datacred>     <secinfo>       <secsys>Unclassified</secsys>       <secclass>Unclassified</secclass>       <sechandl>Unclassified</sechandl>     </secinfo>     <native Sync=\"TRUE\">Microsoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 2; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.2.5.1450</native>     <natvform>File Transfer Protocol</natvform>   </idinfo>   <dataqual>     <attracc>       <attraccr>Not Applicable</attraccr>       <qattracc>         <attraccv>3</attraccv>       </qattracc>     </attracc>     <logic>Compliance with the accuracy standard was ensured by the collection of photo identifiable GPS ground control after the acquisition of aerial imagery.

ISTAR digital surface modeling is based on an auto correlated pixel-matching system within the ISTAR software. The auto correlated digital surface model (DSM) surface represents the initial surface model. This surface is then exported from the UNIX format into a MicroStation compatible format. The techniques used to process the ISTAR DSM (auto correlated surface model) are similar to those used for lidar processing. EarthData has developed a unique method for processing DSM data to identify and remove the majority of elevation points falling on vegetation, buildings, and other above ground structures for generation of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The algorithms for filtering data were utilized within EarthData's proprietary software and commercial software suite of tools provides efficient processing for small to large-scale, projects and has been incorporated into ISO 9001 compliant production work flows. The following is a step-by-step breakdown of the process. 1. Using the DSM ISTAR data set created by EarthData, the technician performed a visual inspection of the data to verify that the flight lines met correctly. The technician also verified that there were no voids, and that the data covered the project limits. The technician then selected a series of areas from the dataset and inspected them where adjacent flight lines met. 2. A process, which utilizes 3-D Analyst and EarthData's proprietary software was run to detect and color code the differences in elevation values and profiles. The technician reviewed this information and located the areas that contained systematic errors or distortions that needed to be removed for creation of a ground ortho. 3. Systematic distortions highlighted in step 2 were removed and the data were re-inspected.  Corrections and adjustments can involve the application of angular deflection or compensation for curvature of the ground surface that can be introduced by crossing from one type of land cover to another. 4.The data were checked against the control network to ensure that vertical requirements were maintained. 5. The resulting product is a digital elevation model (DEM). This digital surface model has been through an automated filtering routine to remove the noise and above ground features. The digital surface model was used in the rectification of ground orthos. 6. The digital surface model data sets were converted to ASCII format and cut to the same tile layout as the final digital orthophotos.</procdesc>         <srcused>Digital Surface Model</srcused>         <procdate>20060501</procdate>         <srcprod>DSM</srcprod>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntorgp>               <cntorg>EarthData International</cntorg>               <cntper>Raquel Charrois</cntper>             </cntorgp>             <cntpos>Project Manager</cntpos>             <cntaddr>               <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype>               <address>7320 Executive Way</address>               <city>Frederick</city>               <state>MD</state>               <postal>21704</postal>               <country>USA</country>             </cntaddr>             <cntvoice>(301)-948-8550</cntvoice>             <cntfax>(301)-963-2064</cntfax>             <cntemail>rcharrois@earthdata.com</cntemail>             <hours>Mon - Fri 9:00 am to 5:00 pm EST</hours>           </cntinfo>         </proccont>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>Once the DSM data for the ortho areas were integrated into the ISTAR system the initial radiometric adjustments were performed on the imagery for each flight line attempting to reach the best possible histogram. The rectification process was run using the processed DSM and the radiometrically balanced imagery on each flight line. A second set of radiometric adjustments were made and mosaic lines were placed. Edge sharpening was applied. QA/QC was performed looking for smears and other indications of problems within the digital orthophoto creation process. The final imagery data set is removed from the ISTAR environment in a process called \"packaging\" where the individual tiles are created.
