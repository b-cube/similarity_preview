Thousands of emails, hundreds of pages of documentation, many, many months of work, several focus groups, and a few fights later, we're ready to share. Welcome to the new KCET.org!</p>  <p><img alt=\"hp-screenshot.jpg\" src=\"http://www.kcet.org/assets/images/hp-screenshot.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"231\" class=\"mt-image-left\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0 20px 20px 0;\" />Well, not quite. That should actually read: Welcome to the new KCET.org beta! Our goal throughout this process has been ambitious: rebuild KCET.org from scratch and, in the process re-imagine what a public television website can be. KCET's website (last overhauled in 2003) has to serve a broad range of constituents. These include viewers looking for schedule information, potential donors looking to support our work, parents and teachers looking for relevant educational programming, Southern California residents looking for best of breed public media content and so on. In terms of our operations, the station's website is a digital crossroads where the full range of the organization's activities meet - fundraising, communications, events, content production and distribution, programming support, community outreach, viewer services and more. </p>  <p>Navigating that profusion of users - each with their distinct goals and needs - is not just a challenge, it's the challenge facing organizations like ours. We think that we've gone a long way towards meet that challenge through a new, easier to use look-and-feel as well as the addition of following new features:</p>  <ul>  <li><a href=\"/video/\">Streaming video channels</a> bringing you the best of  KCET and PBS</li>  <li>An expanded and easier to use <a href=\"/schedule/\">schedule</a></li>  <li>Over 9000 <a href=\"/shows/dinosaur_train/\">episode and show pages</a> giving you in-depth information on every series and show airing on KCET</li>  <li>Extensive commenting, discussion and profile functionality that will allow you <a href=\"/discussions/\">connect with others</a> interested in KCET, public television and Southern California </li>  <li>Expanded <a href=\"/events/\">events listings</a></li>  <li>Expanded content offerings bringing you stories, arts and issues from across Southern California: <a href=\"/socal/departures/\">Departures</a>, <a href=\"/socal/socal_connected_online/\">SoCal Connected</a>, <a href=\"/socal/voices/\">SoCal Voices</a> and <a href=\"/socal/\">more</a></li>  <li>Easier ways to give and <a href=\"/support/\">support KCET's mission</a></li> </ul>  <p>But our work isn't done, though, and we need your help to finish it. As you page through the site we'd like you to leave your feedback about the new KCET.org - bugs & issues, things you like, things you don't like, features you wish we offered, and so on. <a href=\"/discussions/general/site-news-and-help/new-site-feedback-and-bug-reports.html\">We've created a special discussion forum</a> where you can leave your thoughts, so head over and tell us how we're doing. This is your website as well</p>  <p>Many thanks in advance!</p>  <p>Gary - KCET.org Site Editor</p>  <p><a href=\"/discussions/general/site-news-and-help/new-site-feedback-and-bug-reports.html\">Go here to leave us feedback.</a></p>]]>              </content> </entry>  </feed>       ",
