Dataset contains 8247 total observations.  Asthma emergency department visits are selected based on primary discharge diagnosis coding.&#13; &#13; The California EPHT Program receives calendar year emergency department data annually from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD).  Further information on OSHPD is located at:  www.oshpd.ca.gov.&#13; &#13; All state licensed hospitals in California are required by California Health and Safety Code to report to OSHPD data elements for each inpatient and outpatient from the hospital.  The facilities submit their data semiannually via the Medical information Reporting for California (MIRCal), an on-line data transmission method.  Additional fields are computed by OSHPD, such as, length of stay, etc.  The patient's Social Security Number is encrypted to create a unique 9-digit record linkage number, which can be used to link records for the same patient.     &#13; </supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20090101</begdate> <begtime/> <enddate>20091231</enddate> <endtime/> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.409721</westbc> <eastbc>-114.131208</eastbc> <northbc>42.009521999999997</northbc> <southbc>32.53416</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>NONE</themekt> <themekey>Asthma, 493, Emergency Department, Environmental Health Tracking Program, EPHT, Environmental Health</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California, CA, 06</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt>Zip code</placekt> <placekey>NONE</placekey> </place> <place> <placekt/> <placekey>NONE</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>Restricted (secure) data will only be released to external users after the California EPHT Program and representatives from OSHPD have reviewed the request.

Race and ethnicity are not reported in this dataset.</complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>Since 2005, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) has been responsible for routinely collecting data on emergency department (ED) visits from every licensed acute care hospital in California, excluding federal hospitals. Each year, OSHPD compiles the data from all hospitals to create the Emergency Department and Ambulatory Surgery Database. Each year, CEHTP obtains the ED dataset from OSHPD and creates datasets to be used for public health surveillance, while maintaining confidentiality. This dataset on the CEHTP portal includes ED visits due to asthma for 2009. Each ED event is identified by looking at principal discharge diagnosis based on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). A principal diagnostic ICD-9-CM code of 493 indicates a patient who was seen in the ED because of asthma. Rates were calculated by zip code and age-group. To calculate rates, we use population data from a private vendor that estimated zip code level populations by using U.S. census data, U.S. Postal Service delivery routes, and other data sources.
