Richard Feynman in his now famous 1959 talk entitled \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThere\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Plenty of&#13; Room at the Bottom,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd envisioned a world of atomically precise manufacturing&#13; that would fuel advancements in information storage, computing, and other&#13; fields, though he had only a few rudimentary concepts of how to achieve such&#13; a goal at the time.  Move forward to 2015 where the semiconductor industry&#13; routinely manufactures circuit elements that are below 40 nm in size and the&#13; data storage industry is poised to manufacture and sell bit patterned media&#13; with even smaller magnetic elements.  While we have achieved many of the&#13; feats Feynman originally envisioned in his original talk, there is still&#13; plenty of room at the bottom in 2-D and 3-D geometries that cannot yet be&#13; accessed using truly high volume manufacturing techniques.  This talk will&#13; first present a view of current nanomanufacturing capabilities and the&#13; challenges being faced going forward as attempts are made to develop high&#13; volume methods for fabricating sub-30 nm size device features for&#13; microelectronics applications.  The remaining majority of the talk will focus&#13; on the directed self-assembly of block copolymers as one possible method that&#13; could achieve this goal of high volume manufacturing of device elements with&#13; sizes down into sub-10 nm length scales.&#13; &#13; Underlying much of what we envision as nanomanufacturing for functional&#13; devices is the ability to form nanoscale two dimensional and three&#13; dimensional structures in various organic and inorganic materials.  For&#13; example, all modern electronic devices (e.g. computers, cell phones, tablets,&#13; etc.) rely on the use of microprocessors and memory devices that possess&#13; integrated circuit (IC) device features smaller than 50 nm in size.  The&#13; critical and enabling technologies for mass producing such microelectronic&#13; devices are the combination of lithographic materials, processes, and tools&#13; used to pattern the nanoscale device elements that constitute the transistor&#13; device active layers and the subsequent electrical interconnect layers.&#13; However, continuing to scale such devices down in feature size faces a number&#13; of challenges in terms of the materials, tools, and economics of such micro-&#13; and nanofabrication technologies.  Solutions to these problems will require&#13; new materials and new material processing approaches.  The first part of this&#13; talk will quickly review the current state of the art in such lithographic&#13; nanopatterning technologies and some of the current challenges being faced by&#13; traditional lithography and IC manufacturing methods. The second part of the&#13; talk will address how we are applying chemical engineering, materials&#13; science, and synthetic chemistry concepts to develop solutions to these&#13; challenges.  Specifically, we will look at the role self-assembly may play in&#13; the future of nanomanufacturing through the use of block copolymer directed&#13; self-assembly techniques (BCP DSA).  Block copolymers have the natural&#13; tendency to micro-phase separate at length scales commensurate with the&#13; polymer chain dimensions, i.e. on the order of 1 to 100 nm in size.  Left&#13; alone to micro-phase separate in the bulk, such block copolymers form&#13; nanostructured but disordered morphologies.  However, when combined with&#13; templating surfaces patterned with traditional lithography techniques,&#13; nanometer length scale features with the long range order required for&#13; nanomanufacturing can be achieved.  This talk will highlight the synergy of&#13; combining experimental and molecular modeling approaches to attack such&#13; problems and will discuss current achievements and remaining challenges in&#13; the field of BCP DSA.
