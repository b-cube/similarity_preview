Data for the formations, a collective of forces comprising of  at least 50 persons in each collective, provide information on   their social, economic, and political background, population   characteristics, type of formation, age-sex distribution of the   formations, and the political party affiliation of its members.   The antecedent history of the disturbances is also given,   including public memory of previous conflicts, forms of and   responses to violence, interactions with other formations,   character and clarity of objectives, and extent of territory   controlled. Data on the organization of each formation is   provided for the leadership, coordination, segmentation,   stratification, and differentiation of the formation, as well    as the extent of participation in man-days, and the numbers of   participants in the disturbances arrested, killed, or wounded.   Information is also provided on the outcome of the disturbance   and changes resulting from participation in the disturbances.   Additional variables provide detailed descriptions of the   magnitude, duration, objectives, and immediate consequences of   the disturbances. Variables also describe the newspaper, archival,  and secondary sources used in the coding of the data collection.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                     <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>France</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                        <dataKind>event transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A sample size of 578 disturbances occurring in France,  consisting of all disturbances absorbing 1,000 or more man-days   of activity plus a random tenth of all others, involving formations     of at least 50 people with at least two antagonistic formations   present within an autonomous political system, and with physical  damage to someone else or someone else's property.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) Archives Nationales, Paris, and (2) Tilly, Charles,  and James Rule.
