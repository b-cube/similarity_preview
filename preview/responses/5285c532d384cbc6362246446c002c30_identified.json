For example, sampling keyboards often display only the currently selected sound, and it is not easy to know the adjacent sounds or how to find desired ones. Large libraries stored on compact disc may be arranged in an alphabetical file structure, documented by descriptions that do not represent their sounds well. These digital sound libraries are often difficult to scan and audition easily because they are not organized according to sonic qualities. The user does not browse the database directly, but via its text representation. The user must audition sounds one at a time, must remember previous sounds when comparing the current one, and has little sense of the total available selection. These difficulties can detract from the spontaneity and creativity of the user.

Listening to sound presented in such a spatial fashion is as different from conventional stereo mixes as sculpture is from painting. A schizophrenic existence suggests sonic (analytic) cubism, presenting multiple acoustic perspectives simultaneously. Clusters can be used to hierarchically group related mixels together. New interaction modalities are enabled by this sort of perceptual aggression and liquid perspective. In particular, virtual concerts may be \"broken down\" by individuals or groups.

The traversal algorithm was invented in order to extract temporal information from static geometric structures; this information is used as input to a sound synthesis algorithm. A systematic traversal of complexes and associating data to parameters of sound synthesis has many possible applications: the analysis of objects of dimension 4 or higher, exploration of large data sets and music composition. In this paper we limit ourselves to bdimensional objects and present the experimental results from the first phase of our work.
