These products represent the first time this type of 30-meter cell land cover change has been produced for the conterminous United States. Products were generated by comparing spectral characteristics of Landsat imagery between 2001 and 2006, on an individual path/row basis, using protocols to identify and label change based on the trajectory from NLCD 2001 products. A formal accuracy assessment of the NLCD 2006 land cover change product is planned for 2011.</p> <p>Generation of NLCD 2006 products helped to identify some update issues in the NLCD 2001 land cover and percent developed imperviousness products only (there were no changes to the NLCD 2001 percent canopy). These issues were evaluated and corrected, necessitating a reissue of NLCD 2001 products (NLCD 2001 Version 2.0) as part of the NLCD 2006 release. A majority of NLCD 2001 updates occur in coastal mapping zones where NLCD 2001 was published prior to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) 2001 land cover products. NOAA C-CAP 2001 land cover has now been seamlessly integrated with NLCD 2001 land cover for all coastal zones. NLCD 2001 percent developed imperviousness was also updated as part of this process.</p> <p>MRLC Consortium provides a dynamic online map interface that can be used to view USGS datasets.\\ufffd\\ufffd<a href=\"http://gisdata.usgs.gov/website/mrlc/\"> Learn more about the MRLC Consortium Viewer</a></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/gap-land-cover-updated/\">  <title>GAP Land Cover Updated</title>  <link>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/gap-land-cover-updated/</link>   <dc:date>2011-07-20T22:01:30Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator>gapadmin</dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Land Cover Data]]></dc:subject>   <dc:subject><![CDATA[Highlight]]></dc:subject>  <description>GAP updated national land cover data set (version 2) provides detailed information on the vegetation of the United States and enables data users to make conservation or land use planning decisions for</description>  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAP updated national land cover data set (version 2) provides detailed information on the vegetation of the United States and enables data users to make conservation or land use planning decisions for the entire range of a habitat type across administrative boundaries.

This mission will ensure the continued acquisition and availability of Landsat-like data well beyond the duration of the current Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 missions.</p> <p>LDCM was created in October 2002 to investigate and research options for the most feasible solution to follow the Landsat 7 mission. Four options were considered:</p> <ol> <li>a commercial enterprise, which was met with a lack of industry interest;</li> <li>a commercial/government partnership, which was cancelled due to inappropriate risk balancing in 2003;</li> <li>international partnerships, which continue to develop and mature for possible future collaborations;</li> <li>a government-only mission.</li> </ol> <p>A memorandum on December 23, 2005 from the Office of Science and Technology Policy (<a href=\"http://www.ostp.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">OSTP</a>) directed planning to begin for a free-flyer government-only mission.</p> <p>NASA will acquire a spacecraft to collect and provide data to the <a href=\"http://www.doi.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Interior</a> / USGS. The USGS will be responsible for the operations of this mission, along with collecting, archiving, processing, and distributing the data to the U.S. Government and other users. The <a href=\"science_LST_Introduction.php\">Landsat Science Team</a> has been established to address the science goals of the mission. NASA and the USGS plan to implement LDCM in a manner that does not preclude a long-term solution for continuity of Landsat-type data.</p> <p>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), specifics of the mission are source selection sensitive. Information will be released as appropriate on this web site.</p> <p><a href=\"http://landsat.usgs.gov/about_ldcm.php\">Learn more</a></p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/featured-post-1/\">  <title>Land Cover of the Pacific Northwest</title>  <link>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/featured-post-1/</link>   <dc:date>2011-04-18T12:44:06Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Land Cover Data]]></dc:subject>   <dc:subject><![CDATA[Stewards]]></dc:subject>   <dc:subject><![CDATA[Feature]]></dc:subject>  <description>In 2008, the Northwest Regional Gap Analysis Project ( NWGAP) clompleted a land cover map depicting the distribution of Ecological Systems (ES)\\ufffd\\ufffdacross Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Montana, and Wyoming.

Three mapping teams were involved with mapping NWGAP&#8217;s 12 map zones; (1) Oregon State University and U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Corvallis, OR (2) Sanborn Solutions, Inc., Portland, OR, and (3) NWGAP, Moscow, ID. Different modeling approaches were explored to evaluate the effectiveness of each to represent the natural distribution of ES within each map zone and across the region. Oregon State University used Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) and Random Forest modeling techniques, while Sanborn and NWGAP used a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) modeling approach. Frequent communication among the mapping teams ensured consistent application of each ES definition and seamless representation across the region.</p> <p>Collectively, the 12 NWGAP map zones depict the distribution of 173 ES classes and 32 land cover and disturbed classes across the Northwest. Of the 173 ES classes, 24 are barren or sparsely vegetated, 22 are grassland systems, 31 are shrub or steppe systems, 54 are forest, woodland, or savanna systems, and 43 are wetland and riparian systems. The 32 land cover and disturbed classes consist of 15 developed or agricultural land classes, 7 introduced vegetation classes, 4 harvested vegetation type classes, and 3 recently burned habitat classes. Deterministic accuracy rates for many ES are greater than 80 percent.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> ]]></content:encoded>  </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/vegetation-dynamics/\">  <title>Modeling Vegetation Dynamics</title>  <link>http://gapanalysis.usgs.gov/gaplandcover/vegetation-dynamics/</link>   <dc:date>2011-04-17T00:29:37Z</dc:date>  <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>    <dc:subject><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></dc:subject>   <dc:subject><![CDATA[Feature]]></dc:subject>  <description>The Southeastern U.S. has experienced rapid land use change\\ufffd\\ufffddue to\\ufffd\\ufffdthree primary drivers of change (timber management, regeneration of forests from farmland, and urbanization).
