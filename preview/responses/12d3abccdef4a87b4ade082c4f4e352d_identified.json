S.; Wood, S.; Greenfield, S. M.; Gill, P.; Mant, J.; Mohammed, M. A.; Heer, G.; Johal, A.; Kaur, R.; Schwartz, C.; McManus, R. J. Background: This study investigated the relationship of ethnicity to the differences between blood pressure (BP) measured in a clinic setting and by ambulatory monitoring (ABPM) in individuals with and (HT) without (NHT) a previous diagnosis of hypertension. &#13; Methods: A cross sectional comparison of BP measurement was performed in 700 participants (White British (39%), South Asian (31%) and African Caribbean (30%)) in 28 primary care clinics in West Midlands UK.  Mean differences between daytime ABPM, standardised clinic (mean of three occasions), casual clinic (first reading on first occasion) and last routine BP taken at the GP practice were compared in HT and NHT individuals. &#13; Results: Daytime systolic and diastolic ABPM readings were similar to standardised clinic BP (systolic: 128(SE0.9)vs125(SE0.9)mmHg (NHT) and 132(SE0.7)vs131(SE0.7)mmHg (HT)) and were not associated with ethnicity to a clinically important extent.  When BP was taken less carefully differences emerged: casual clinic readings were higher than ABPM, particularly in the HT group where the systolic differences approached clinical relevance (131(SE1.2)vs129(SE1.0)mmHg (NHT) and 139(SE0.9)vs133(SE0.7)mmHg (HT)) and were larger in South Asian and African Caribbean hypertensive individuals (136(SE1.5)vs133(SE1.2)mmHg (WB) and 141(SE1.7)vs133(SE1.4)mmHg (SA) and 142(SE1.6)vs134(SE1.3)mmHg (AC)) mean differences 3(0-7),p=0.03 and 4(1-7),p=0.01, respectively.  Differences were also observed for the last practice reading in South Asian and African Caribbeans. &#13; Conclusions: Blood pressure differences between ethnic groups where BP is carefully measured on multiple occasions are small and unlikely to alter clinical management. When BP is measured casually on a single occasion or in routine care, differences appear that could approach clinical relevance.

Males also activate their cercal system by air currents generated due to the wing movements underlying sound production. Singing males still respond to external wind stimulation, but are not startled by the self-generated airflow. To investigate how the nervous system discriminates sensory responses to self-generated and external airflow, we intracellularly recorded wind-sensitive afferents and ventral GIs of the cercal escape pathway in fictively singing crickets, a situation lacking any self-stimulation. GI spiking was reduced whenever cercal wind stimulation coincided with singing motor activity. The axonal terminals of cercal afferents showed no indication of presynaptic inhibition during singing. In two ventral GIs, however, a corollary discharge inhibition occurred strictly in phase with the singing motor pattern. Paired intracellular recordings revealed that this inhibition was not mediated by the activity of the previously identified corollary discharge interneuron (CDI) that rhythmically inhibits the auditory pathway during singing. Cercal wind stimulation, however, reduced the spike activity of this CDI by postsynaptic inhibition. Our study reveals how precisely timed corollary discharge inhibition of ventral GIs can prevent self-generated airflow from triggering inadvertent escape responses in singing crickets. The results indicate that the responsiveness of the auditory and wind-sensitive pathway is modulated by distinct CDIs in singing crickets and that the corollary discharge inhibition in the auditory pathway can be attenuated by cercal wind stimulation.

P.; Lee, Jasinda H.; Chen, Christopher; Ballard, Clive; Hortob\\ufffd\\ufffdgyi, Tibor; Francis, Paul T. Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease dementia (PDD) are characterized&#13; by the presence of \\ufffd\\ufffd-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites.&#13; However, both dementias also show variable degrees of Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease (AD) pathology&#13; (senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), particularly in areas of the cortex associated&#13; with higher cognitive functions. This study investigates the contribution of the&#13; individual and combined pathologies in determining the rate of cognitive decline. Cortical&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd-synuclein, phosphorylated tau (phosphotau) and A\\ufffd\\ufffd plaque pathology in 34 PDD and 55&#13; DLB patients was assessed semi-quantitatively in four regions of the neocortex. The decline&#13; in cognition, assessed by Mini Mental State Examination, correlated positively with the&#13; cortical \\ufffd\\ufffd-synuclein load. Patients also had varying degrees of senile A\\ufffd\\ufffd plaque and&#13; phosphotau pathology. Regression analyses pointed to a combined pathology (A\\ufffd\\ufffd plaque&#13; plus phosphotau plus \\ufffd\\ufffd-synuclein-positive features), particularly in the prefrontal cortex&#13; (BA9) and temporal lobe neocortex with the superior and middle temporal gyrus (BA21,&#13; 22), being a major determining factor in the development of dementia. Thus, cognitive&#13; decline in Lewy body dementias is not a consequence of \\ufffd\\ufffd-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration&#13; alone but senile plaque and phosphorylated tau pathology also contribute to&#13; the overall deficits.

While contextual challenges associated with improvement in primary care have been documented previously, we still know relatively little about how the intentional, theory-informed facilitation of evidence-based change is shaped by contextual factors within this healthcare setting. Hence, a qualitative study was conducted to address the question: How is the process of facilitating evidence-based practice affected by the context of primary care?&#13; Methods&#13; &#13; Data collection took place across general practices in northwest England as part of a process evaluation of the Greater Manchester HF Investigation Tool (GM-HFIT) - a programme of work aiming to improve the management of HF in primary care. Semi-structured interviews, with purposefully selected GM-HFIT team members (n\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd=\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd9) and primary care practitioners (n\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd=\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd7), were supplemented by observational data and a three-month diary reflecting on facilitation activities. Framework analysis was used to manage and interpret data.&#13; Results&#13; &#13; We describe a complex and dynamic interplay between facilitation and context, focusing on three major themes: (1) Addressing macro and micro agendas; (2) Forming a facilitative unit; (3) Maintaining momentum. We show that HF specialist nurses (HFSNs) have a high level of professional credibility, which allows them to play a key role in making recommendations to practices for improving patient care. At the same time, we argue that contextual factors, such as top-level endorsement, the necessity to comply with a performance measurement system, and the varying involvement of practice nurses produce tensions that can have both an enabling and constraining effect on the process of facilitation.&#13; Conclusions&#13; &#13; When facilitating the transfer of evidence, context is an important aspect to consider at a macro and micro level; a complex interplay can exist between these levels, which may constrain or enable efforts to amend practice. Those involved in facilitating change within primary care have to manage tensions arising from the interplay of these different contextual forces to minimise their impact on efforts to alter practice based on best evidence.
