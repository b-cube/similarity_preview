The interviews focused on county-, district-, and precinct-level organization and activities as well as on related perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors of the party leadership toward the party structure at each level. Questions probed the respondents' living experiences before coming to Detroit, and their behavior regarding changes of residence since coming to Detroit. The use of phones within the home was also ascertained. Items assessing various influences on the respondents' political attitudes and behaviors were included in the interview. The respondents were asked to indicate the mass media on which they depended most heavily for political information, and how often politics was discussed in meetings with family, friends, neighbors, and other groups to which they belonged. The strength of the respondent's political party affiliation and perceptions of differences between the major parties on various issues were also explored. Questions were asked about the importance and frequency of voting, the respondent's knowledge of and involvement in local party politics, knowledge of precinct workers and the state party chairman, and general attitudes toward politics and political figures such as Adlai Stevenson and Dwight Eisenhower. Also studied were the respondent's opinions regarding several controversial issues, including national health care, school integration, ending the selective service system, and monetary aid to countries that were not anti-communist. Background variables established the respondent's age, sex, race, educational level, marital status, occupation, social class, political affiliation, number of children, religious preference, and relationship to the head of the household. Demographic information was also collected on the respondent's father.</p> <p>More information about the Detroit Area Studies Project is available on this <ExtLink URI=\"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/detroitareastudies/\">Web site</ExtLink>.</p>                               </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1957\" cycle=\"P1\">1957</timePrd>                                         <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Detroit</geogCover>             <geogCover>Michigan</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Republican and Democratic precinct leaders in Wayne County, Michigan.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 The 149 respondents were weighted to 281.         </notes>                  <notes>                 Users may also wish to consult DETROIT AREA STUDY, 1957: PARTY LEADERSHIP AND POLITICAL BEHAVIOR AND INTRA-CLASS CORRELATION OF ATTITUDES IN DETROIT (ICPSR 7280), a closely related study dealing with the political activities and attitudes of an adult cross-section sample from the same geographic area.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR07107.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
