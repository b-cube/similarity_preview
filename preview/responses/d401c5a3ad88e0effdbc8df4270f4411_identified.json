Participating care homes were randomised between May 2010 and March 2012.&#13; &#13; Intervention Targeted three month programme of occupational therapy, delivered by qualified occupational therapists and assistants, involving patient centred goal setting, education of care home staff, and adaptations to the environment.&#13; &#13; Main outcome measures Primary outcome at the participant level: scores on the Barthel index of activities of daily living at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures at the participant level: Barthel index scores at six and 12 months post-randomisation, and scores on the Rivermead mobility index, geriatric depression scale-15, and EuroQol EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, at all time points.&#13; &#13; Results 64% of the participants were women and 93% were white, with a mean age of 82.9 years. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups for all measures, personal characteristics, and diagnostic tests. Overall, 2538 occupational therapy visits were made to 498 participants in the intervention arm (mean 5.1 visits per participant). No adverse events attributable to the intervention were recorded. 162 (11%) died before the primary outcome time point, and 313 (30%) died over the 12 months of the trial. The primary outcome measure did not differ significantly between the treatment arms. The adjusted mean difference in Barthel index score at three months was 0.19 points higher in the intervention arm (95% confidence interval \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd0.33 to 0.70, P=0.48). Secondary outcome measures also showed no significant differences at all time points.&#13; &#13; Conclusions This large phase III study provided no evidence of benefit for the provision of a routine occupational therapy service, including staff training, for care home residents living with stroke related disabilities. The established three month individualised course of occupational therapy targeting stroke related disabilities did not have an impact on measures of functional activity, mobility, mood, or health related quality of life, at all observational time points. Providing and targeting ameliorative care in this clinically complex population requires alternative strategies.&#13; &#13; Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN00757750.

The pattern of association at these loci is consistent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who are at high risk of EOC. After imputation to 1000 Genomes Project data, we assessed associations of 11 million genetic variants with EOC risk from 15,437 cases unselected for family history and 30,845 controls and from 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers (3,096 with ovarian cancer), and we combined the results in a meta-analysis. This new study design yielded increased statistical power, leading to the discovery of six new EOC susceptibility loci. Variants at 1p36 (nearest gene, WNT4), 4q26 (SYNPO2), 9q34.2 (ABO) and 17q11.2 (ATAD5) were associated with EOC risk, and at 1p34.3 (RSPO1) and 6p22.1 (GPX6) variants were specifically associated with the serous EOC subtype, all with P &lt; 5 \\ufffd\\ufffd 10\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd8. Incorporating these variants into risk assessment tools will improve clinical risk predictions for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.

Background: For patients with symptoms of possible cancer who do not fulfil the criteria for urgent referral, initial investigation in&#13; primary care has been advocated in the United Kingdom and supported by additional resources. The consequence of this strategy&#13; for the timeliness of diagnosis is unknown.&#13; Methods: We analysed data from the English National Audit of Cancer Diagnosis in Primary Care on patients with lung (1494),&#13; colorectal (2111), stomach (246), oesophagus (513), pancreas (327), and ovarian (345) cancer relating to the ordering of&#13; investigations by the General Practitioner and their nature. Presenting symptoms were categorised according to National Institute&#13; for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on referral for suspected cancer. We used linear regression to estimate the mean&#13; difference in primary-care interval by cancer, after adjustment for age, gender, and the symptomatic presentation category.&#13; Results: Primary-care investigations were undertaken in 3198/5036 (64%) of cases. The median primary-care interval was 16 days&#13; (IQR 5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd45) for patients undergoing investigation and 0 days (IQR 0\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd10) for those not investigated. Among patients whose&#13; symptoms mandated urgent referral to secondary care according to NICE guidelines, between 37% (oesophagus) and 75%&#13; (pancreas) were first investigated in primary care. In multivariable linear regression analyses stratified by cancer site, adjustment for&#13; age, sex, and NICE referral category explained little of the observed prolongation associated with investigation.&#13; Interpretation: For six specified cancers, investigation in primary care was associated with later referral for specialist assessment. This&#13; effect was independent of the nature of symptoms. Some patients for whom urgent referral is mandated by NICE guidance are&#13; nevertheless investigated before referral. Reducing the intervals between test order, test performance, and reporting can help reduce&#13; the prolongation of primary-care intervals associated with investigation use. Alternative models of assessment should be considered. This is the final published version.

Lyratzopoulos, Georgios; Wardle, Jane; Rubin, Greg The timely diagnosis of cancer is a frequent theme in the lay&#13; press and an increasingly common topic for quality improvement&#13; initiatives.1 2&#13; The UK\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds health secretary has advocated ranking general&#13; practices on the NHS Choices website according to how&#13; promptly patients subsequently diagnosed with cancer are&#13; referred to specialist services for suspected cancer.3 But is such&#13; a policy based on evidence? Its main assumption is that the&#13; multiple visits made by these patients to primary care before&#13; referral chiefly reflect poor professional performance rather&#13; than factors such as clinical complexity, reasonable watchful&#13; waiting, or the need for appropriate investigations in primary&#13; care. We review the occurrence of multiple pre-referral&#13; consultations and discuss how a better understanding of variation&#13; between cancers might improve the timeliness of diagnosis.
