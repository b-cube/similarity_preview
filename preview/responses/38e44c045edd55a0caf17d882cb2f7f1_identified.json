Through an affective and imaginative engagement with Vaishnav cultural history, devotees learn to relocate themselves in a particular temporal flow, within which both the past and future become constitutive horizons of the ethical imagination. I will focus on how the tradition of katha (storytelling) facilitates a convergence of temporalities, within which devotees are encouraged to routinely participate in the past. Such engagement with an enchanted past, I will argue, in turn informs devotees\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd imaginings of and aspirations for the ongoing development of an \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIdeal Vedic City\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>John Fahy</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-22</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-22</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>4</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1097\">        <title>Designing an Illusion of India\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Future Superpowerdom</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1097</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The article dissects current utopian visions of future Indian superpowerdom and traces them to underlying convergences between right wing political Hindu nationalism and philanthrocapitalism. By looking at how utopian visions are materialized in the elitist aesthetics of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdroyal chic\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd parading on New Delhi\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds fashion ramps and in the aesthetics of hypermodern smart cities of the future, the article explores the aesthetic and affective convergence of an imagined economy and (re-)invented traditions. In the problematic terrain of philanthrocapitalism, the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfactish\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of GDP and the &lt;em&gt;doxa&lt;/em&gt; of Indianness have come to form the core of current populist myths. In so doing they produce an illusion of future India that nobody really believes in, yet structures reality and is passionately embraced by many. The article suggests that the problem with such utopian myths is not that they are myths, but rather it is the direction they are pushing in and their consequences which require questioning. The article provides preliminary analysis of, and answers around, this problematic of resonant versus dissonant futures and their imaginaries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Tereza Kuldova</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-22</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-22</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>4</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1109\">        <title>Building Castles in the Air</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1109</link>            <description>.</description>            <dc:creator>Ian M.

The dream epitomises the alterations that observation causes on the portions of reality that the ethnographer selects and concentrates upon. The rest of the essay tells of how the author attempted to find his own personal solution to the problem of representation thanks to inspiration found in a photo exhibition and the letter of a friend and mentor. Such interpenetration of oneiric, photographic, and epistolary materials works as a pretext to discuss the importance of remaining faithful to the anthropological mission of making people visible and not being hindered by the methodological impossibility of representation.</description>            <dc:creator>Rodolfo Maggio</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-22</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-22</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>4</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1088\">        <title>an etymology of desire: de sidere, from the stars</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1088</link>            <description>This poem attempts to explore the dynamics between time, desire, and our capacity to dream, and how that in turn impacts our perceptions of ourselves.</description>            <dc:creator>Emily Lynn Cook</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-22</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-22</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>4</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1095\">        <title>Stillness as a Form of Imaginative Labour</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1095</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;This essay connects the practice of stillness to David Graeber&#039;s concepts of imaginative labour and immanent imagination. It makes the proposition that stillness should not be evaluated as lack of activity or movement, but rather attended to in its pragmatic and productive dimensions. The essay thus explores stillness as a potential mode of production of imagination and means of political transformation: in order for it to be meaningful, we need to reconfigure our relationship to stillness as one of imagination, resistance, thinking, and writing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Theodoros Kyriakides</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-12-22</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-12-22</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>4</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1061\">        <title>The Story of the End of the World: An Alternative Approach to the Future at the Japanese Museum of Science and Innovation</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/unfamiliar/article/view/1061</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;The following discussion is a critical assessment of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdStory of the End of the World: 73 Questions We Must Answer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, an exhibition at the Miraikan.
