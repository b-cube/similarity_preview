The file is georeferenced to earth's surface using geographic projection and decimal degree coordinate system.  The specifications for the horizontal control of Q3 Flood Data files are consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:24000. </abstract>    <purpose> The FIRM is the basis for floodplain management, mitigation, and insurance activities for the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Insurance applications include enforcement of the mandatory purchase requirement of the Flood Disaster Protection Act which \"... requires the puchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by Federally supervised, regulated or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards\" (Section 2 (b) (4) of the 1973 Flood Disaster Protection Act).  In addition to the identification of Special Flood Hazard Areas, the risk zones shown on the FIRMs are the basis for the establishment of premium rates for flood coverage offered through the NFIP.  Q3 Flood Data files are intended to convey certain key features from the existing hard copy FIRM to provide users with automated flood risk data. Edge&#45;matching errors, overlaps and deficiencies in coverage, and similar problems are not corrected during digitizing or post&#45;processing.  These data may be used to locate Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs).  More detailed information may be obtained from the paper FIRM. </purpose>    <langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata></descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>1996</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>Publication date of sources</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>Irregular</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>&#45;102.5</westbc>     <eastbc>&#45;94.6</eastbc>     <northbc>40.0</northbc>     <southbc>37.0</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>     <themekey>Q3 Flood Data</themekey>     <themekey>Q3 Coverage</themekey>     <themekey>Special Flood Hazard Areas</themekey>     <themekey>Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps</themekey>     <themekey>FEMA Flood Hazard Zones</themekey></theme>    <place>     <placekt>None</placekt>     <placekey>[CO_NAME]</placekey>     <placekey>KS</placekey>     <placekey>USA</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>None.

The attribute definitions may be found in the \"Q3 Flood Data Specfications\".  Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of source graphic with hardcopy plots and a symbolized display on an interactive computer graphic system.  Selected attributes that could not be visually verified were individually queried.  In addition, an ARC/INFO Arc Macro Language (AML) software program was applied to the dataset to test the attributes against a master set of valid attributes for the specific data category, and a complete set of valid attribute combinations.  (See also Entity Attribute Information). </attraccr>    <qattracc>     <attraccv>See Explanation</attraccv>     <attracce>Attribute accuracy is described, where present, with each attribute defined in the Entity and Attribute Section.</attracce>    </qattracc>   </attracc>   <logic> Polygon and chain&#45;node topology are present.  Certain node&#45;area&#45;line relationships are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements. Some of these requirements include:  lines must begin and end at nodes, lines must connect to each other at nodes, lines do not extend through nodes, left and right areas are defined for each line segment and are consistent throughout the files, and the lines representing the limits of the file neatlines are free of gaps.  Tests of logical consistency were performed by ARC/INFO software modules.  Check plots were made to test for leaks in all internal polygons. </logic>   <complete> Data completeness for Q3 Flood Data files reflect the content of the source graphic.  Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints.  Flood risk data are developed for communities participating in the NFIP, for use in insurance rating, and for floodplain management.  Flood hazard areas are determined using statistical analysis of records of river flow, storm tides, and rainfall;  information obtained through consultation with the communities:  floodplain topographic surveys; and hydrological and hydraulic analysis.  Both detailed and approximate analyses are employed.  Generally, detailed analylses are used to generate flood risk data only for developed or developing areas of communities.  For undeveloped areas where little or no development is expected to occur, FEMA uses approximate analyses to generate flood risk data.  Typically, only drainage areas that are greater than one square mile are studied.  The Q3 Flood Data coverages may be derived from DFIRM&#45;DLGs, from FIRM&#45;DLGs, from FIRMs digitized previously for emergency applications, or may be newly created files.  In Q3 Flood Data derived from older data sets, certain items may not have been captured or may have been captured differently from the current Q3 Flood Data specifications.  In some cases, preliminary FIRM data have been included in the Q3 Flood Data files. These data have been provided to the community for their review and comment and may be subject to change before their final publication date.  In addition, in some cases areas designated as Flood Prone Areas on maps prepared by USGS and FIA have been included in the Q3 Flood Data files.  These areas were delineated based on available information on past floods and are described by a unique attribute code that distinquishes them from areas of 1% annual chance of flooding derived from FIRMs.  Flood Insurance Rate Maps continually undergo revisions and updates.  Some of these revisions are effected by letter (Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)).  Q3 Flood Data may not reflect the most current information or information that is not mappable at the publication scale of FIRM.

Horizontal control of Q3 Flood Data was established using USGS quadrangle maps at 1:24000 or other standard scales.  Users should assess the horizontal positional sources and the requirements of their application.  With increased frequency, large&#45;scale spatial data sets are becoming widely available for computer&#45;based geographic information systems.  Q3 Flood Data may be used in combination with other digital spatial data; however, users should be aware that scalar enlargements do not enhance the relative accuracy of the Q3 Flood Data (i.e. 1:24000). </horizpar>    </horizpa>   </posacc>   <lineage>    <srcinfo>     <srccite>      <citeinfo>       <origin>Federal Emergency Management Agency</origin>       <pubdate>1996</pubdate>       <title>Flood Insurance Rate Map, [CO_NAME] COUNTY</title>       <geoform>map</geoform>       <pubinfo>        <pubplace>Washington, DC</pubplace>        <publish>Federal Emergency Management Agency</publish>       </pubinfo>       <onlink>http://www.kansasgis.org</onlink></citeinfo>     </srccite>     <srcscale>12000&#45;24000</srcscale>     <typesrc>paper</typesrc>     <srctime>      <timeinfo>       <sngdate>        <caldate>19880816</caldate>       </sngdate>      </timeinfo>      <srccurr>effective date</srccurr>     </srctime>     <srccitea>FIRM1</srccitea>     <srccontr>spatial and attribute information</srccontr>    </srcinfo>    <procstep>     <procdesc> Q3 Flood Data format was produced by either scanning or manually digitizing a hardcopy version of the graphic materials.  The scanning process captured the digital data and the resulting raster data was vectorized and attributed on an interactive editing station.  Manual digitizing used a digitizing table to capture the digital data; attribution was performed either as the data was digitized or on an interactive edit station after the digitizing was completed.  The determination of the production methodology was based on various criteria, including availability of production systems.  Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the map were used for registration during manual digitizing.  A projection transformation was performed on the coordinates used in the data collection and editing systems to register the digital data to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates. The ARC/INFO coverage of the Q3 Flood Data was generated, and it was also used to create the Q3&#45;DLG file.  The Q3 Flood Data was checked for position and attribute accuracy by comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source and by symbolizing display on an interactive computer graphic system.  Selected attributes that could not be visually verified were individually queried.  In addition, an ARC/INFO Arc Macro Language (AML) software program was applied to the dataset to test the attributes against a master set of valid attributes for the specific data category and a complete set of valid attribute combinations.  Source graphics were revised to reflect updates effected by Letters of Map Change (Letter of Map Revision (LOMR), Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)).  These revisions were included in the Q3 Flood Data if they were mappable at the publication scale of the source graphic.  Once final, the ARC/INFO coverage was projected into a geographic grid system using decimal degree latitude and longitude coordinates and then converted into an ARC/INFO export file and MapInfo native table files.  In addition, the ARC/INFO coverage in UTM coordinates was converted into a Digital Line Graph file.  All final files were checked for logical consistency and completeness. </procdesc>     <srcused>FIRM1 &#45; FIRM6, LOMC1 &#45; LOMC4</srcused>     <procdate>1996</procdate>    </procstep>    <procstep><procdesc Sync=\"TRUE\">Metadata imported.</procdesc><srcused Sync=\"TRUE\">C:\\\\DOCUME~1\\\\battles\\\\LOCALS~1\\\\Temp\\\\xmlCA63.tmp</srcused><date Sync=\"TRUE\">20031218</date><time Sync=\"TRUE\">11120300</time></procstep></lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>   <direct>Vector</direct>   <ptvctinf>    <sdtsterm>     <sdtstype>Point</sdtstype>     <ptvctcnt>1304</ptvctcnt>    </sdtsterm>    <sdtsterm>     <sdtstype>String</sdtstype>     <ptvctcnt>3663</ptvctcnt>    </sdtsterm>    <sdtsterm>     <sdtstype>GT&#45;polygon composed of chains</sdtstype>     <ptvctcnt>1305</ptvctcnt>    </sdtsterm>   </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <geograph>     <latres>.000009</latres>     <longres>.000009</longres>     <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>    </geograph>    <geodetic>     <horizdn>North American Datum of 1927</horizdn>     <ellips>Clarke 1866</ellips>     <semiaxis>6378206.4</semiaxis>     <denflat>294.98</denflat>    </geodetic>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <detailed>    <enttyp>     <enttypl>Q3.PAT</enttypl>     <enttypd>Polygon attribute table comprising 21 items.</enttypd>     <enttypds>Printed FIRM maps, digital data sources, or other information as appropriate.</enttypds>    </enttyp>    <attr>     <attrlabl>AREA</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Area of polygon/region in square coverage units</attrdef>     <attrdefs>Computed</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <edom>       <edomv>Positive real numbers</edomv>      </edom>     </attrdomv>     <attrmfrq>Unknown</attrmfrq>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>PERIMETER</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Perimeter of poly/region in coverage units</attrdef>     <attrdefs>Computed</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <edom>       <edomv>Positive real numbers</edomv>      </edom>     </attrdomv>     <attrmfrq>Unknown</attrmfrq>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>Q3#</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Internal feature number</attrdef>     <attrdefs>Computed</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <edom>       <edomv>Sequential unique positive integer</edomv>      </edom>     </attrdomv>     <attrmfrq>Unknown</attrmfrq>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>Q3&#45;ID</attrlabl>     <attrdef>User&#45;assigned feature number</attrdef>     <attrdefs>User&#45;defined</attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <edom>       <edomv>Integer</edomv>      </edom>     </attrdomv>     <attrmfrq>Unknown</attrmfrq>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>FIPS</attrlabl>     <attrdef>Standard 5&#45;digit State and County FIPS codes</attrdef>     <attrdefs> Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST) </attrdefs>     <attrdomv>      <codesetd>       <codesetn>Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS)</codesetn>       <codesets>National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology (NIST)</codesets>      </codesetd>     </attrdomv>     <attrmfrq>Unknown</attrmfrq>    </attr>    <attr>     <attrlabl>COMMUNITY</attrlabl>     <attrdef> Identifies a county, city, or other community responsible for floodplain management.
