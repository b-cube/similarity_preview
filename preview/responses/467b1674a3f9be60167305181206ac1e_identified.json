The series of LCM2007 products includes vector and raster formats, with a number of different versions containing varying levels of detail and at different spatial resolutions.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Land cover</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biodiversity Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC03259</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>LCM2007</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-07-23T10:27:42Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/289805c2-4be7-4fb5-b6ec-1539ed88c43d\">     <title>Land Cover Map 2007 (1km percentage aggregate class, GB) v1.2</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/289805c2-4be7-4fb5-b6ec-1539ed88c43d</link>     <description>This dataset consists of a 1km resolution raster version of the Land Cover Map 2007 for Great Britain.  The raster consists of 10 bands. Within each band, each 1km pixel represents a percentage cover value for one of 10 aggregate classes. The aggregate classes are aggregations of the target classes, broadly representing Broad Habitats (see below). The dataset is part of a series of data products  produced by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology known as LCM2007. LCM2007 is a parcel-based thematic classification of satellite image data covering the entire United Kingdom. The map updates and upgrades the Land Cover Map of Great Britain (LCMGB) 1990 and LCM2000. Like the earlier 1990 and 2000 products, LCM2007 is derived from a computer classification of satellite scenes obtained mainly from Landsat, IRS and SPOT sensors and also incorporates information derived from other ancillary datasets.
