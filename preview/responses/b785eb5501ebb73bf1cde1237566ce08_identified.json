Its aim is to provide a minimal, forward-compatible       transitional extension to HNCP to promote testing, deployment and       adoption of homenet technology while the IGP decision and standardization       process is not yet finalized.</t>      </abstract>   </front>   <middle>     <section title=\"Introduction\">        <t>While it is expected that the average number of routers and their       hardware and software capabilities in a typical home network will       grow over time, this trend has historically been gradual.       Thus it can be expected that in the near future there will most       likely be not more than a handful of routers in a home and their       capabilities for operating in a fully-routed mode are limited.</t>               <t>It is also hard to predict which types of other networks the homenet       technology will be used in and what attributes these networks will have       (e.g. number of routers, links, link-types, topologies, suitable methods       for detecting link-layer status and deriving metric). Furthermore the       standardization of autoconfiguring and source-dest-routing capable       protocols is not expected to be finalized soon and there is currently a       shortage of widely testable or deployable implementations fulfilling       these criteria.</t>              <t>These issues and a general lack of consensus over an all-purpose       routing protocol support a transitional forward-compatible extension       to <xref target=\"I-D.ietf-homenet-hncp\">HNCP</xref> implementations       in order to advance homenet progress and to promote adoption. This draft       describes a solution sufficient for small networks allowing gradual       adoption of homenet principles into existing networks while ensuring       an easy transition to a future standardized version.</t>      </section>      <section title=\"Implementation Requirements for Incremental Deployments\">       <t>Each homenet router runs an incremental connectivity algorithm       at all times on each network interface it is running HNCP on and can       optionally additionally run one or more routing protocols.</t>              <t>A router running a routing protocol alongside the incremental       connectivity algorithm must strictly prefer all routes of the routing       protocol over all routes generated by the incremental connectivity       algorithm, except for those having destinations not already known       to the routing protocol but that lie within one of the designated       prefixes of the homenet (i.e. prefixes assigned by a homenet router       that does not speak the respective routing protocol).         In case of routers running more than one routing protocol alongside the       incremental connectivity algorithm, all such routers in the homenet       ensure that in doing so they do not cause routing loops, e.g. by       agreeing upon a network-wide order in which routes of the protocols       are considered.</t>      </section>   <section title=\"Incremental Connectivity Algorithm\">   <t>This algorithm is designed to provide connectivity in small home   networks that would not benefit from exploiting link characteristics   or metrics. It is intentionally kept simple to require no additional   TLV-information by reusing existing topology and address assignment   information provided by HNCP and only requires minimal implementation   overhead.</t>      <t>Each homenet router traverses the HNCP neighbor graph using   a breadth-first search starting with its own node's immediate neighbors.   Neighbors of a node are traversed in ascending order of their   node identifier. During traversal the router determines the path to each   other router (R), the next-hop neighbor N(R) and the number of hops to it D(R).     The router then creates routes based on the following rules:</t>      <texttable>    <ttcol>Create a route</ttcol>       <ttcol>To</ttcol>       <ttcol>From</ttcol>       <ttcol>Via</ttcol>       <ttcol>Metric</ttcol>       <c>For each Prefix (A) in an Assigned Prefix TLV of any Router (R)</c>       <c>A</c>       <c>any</c>       <c>N(R)</c>       <c>D(R)</c>       <c>For each IPv6 prefix (P) in a       Delegated Prefix TLV of any Router (R)</c>       <c>::/0</c>       <c>P</c>       <c>N(R)</c>       <c>D(R)</c>       <c>For the first Router (R) traversed that       announces an IPv4 Delegated Prefix TLV</c>       <c>0.0.0.0/0</c>       <c>any</c>       <c>N(R)</c>       <c>D(R)</c>   </texttable>         <t>This process is repeated every time the router detects a change in the   neighbor graph or prefix assignment information in the network.</t>  </section>      <section title=\"Security Considerations\">        <t>The mechanism described in this document is based on HNCP,       thus security considerations for this document are already covered       by <xref target=\"I-D.ietf-homenet-hncp\" />.</t>      </section>          <section title=\"IANA Considerations\">        <t>This document has no actions for IANA.</t>      </section>    </middle>   <back>     <references title=\"Normative references\">       <?rfc include=\"reference.I-D.draft-ietf-homenet-hncp-04\"?>     </references>          <section title=\"Acknowledgements\">       <t>Thanks to Pierre Pfister and Markus Stenberg for comments and suggestions.</t>     </section>    </back> </rfc> ",
