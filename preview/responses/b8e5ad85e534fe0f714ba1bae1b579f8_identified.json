The model predicts a CO2 footprint characterised by a diameter of about 3.5 km&#xD; and a maximum pressure build up of 38 bars. The solubility trapping has been quantified, predicting a dissolution in brine of&#xD; 69% and 79% of the total amount of CO2 injected after 1000 and 2000 years respectively. The residual trapping has also been&#xD; found to play an important role, with 9% and 6% of the injected CO2 being locked into the hosting matrix pores after 1000 and&#xD; 2000 years respectively. Considering a worst-case scenario for leakages, where zero critical capillarity pressure has been&#xD; assumed, minor CO2 leakages through the caprock have been identified, caused by the combined effects of the long-term&#xD; structural trapping and the large and lasting overpressure caused by the CO2 injection in an ideally closed system. Finally, some&#xD; preliminary work undertaken as part of an ongoing effort to couple a geochemical model to the multi-phase flow simulations&#xD; reveals i) small changes in mineral volume fraction and porosity during and after the injection (~5% after 1000 years), and ii) a&#xD; not negligible self-sealing effect due to precipitation of calcite in the lower layer of the caprock. Further investigations and&#xD; longer physical time runs are needed to confirm this assumption, but also to gain more confidence on the geochemical model&#xD; built so far and to estimate the mineral trapping potential for this site.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9214\">     <title>La ricarica naturale della falda idrica dell'acquifero costiero di Metaponto</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9214</link>     <description>Title: La ricarica naturale della falda idrica dell'acquifero costiero di Metaponto Authors: Masciopinto, C.; CNR-IRSA, Bari; Polemio, M.; CNR-IRPI, Bari Abstract: Si tratta di un acquifero poroso disposto lungo la costa ionica.

W.; National Taiwan University, Taiwan; Ozacar, A.; Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey; Walia, V.; National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering, Taipei, Taiwan Abstract: We investigated the geochemical features of the fluids circulating over the Amik Basin (SE Turkey\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdSyria border),&#xD; which is crossed by the Northern extension of theDSF (Dead Sea Fault) and represents the boundary area of three&#xD; tectonic plates (Anatolian, Arabian and African plates). We collected 34 water samples (thermal and cold from&#xD; natural springs and boreholes) as well as 8 gas samples (bubbling and gas seepage) besides the gases dissolved&#xD; in the sampled waters. The results show that the dissolved gas phase is a mixture of shallow (atmospheric) and&#xD; deep components either of mantle and crustal origin. Coherently the sampled waters are variable mixtures of&#xD; shallow and deep ground waters, the latter being characterised by higher salinity and longer residence times.&#xD; The deep groundwaters (fromboreholes deeper than 1000 m)have a CH4-dominated dissolved gas phase related&#xD; to the presence of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The very unique tectonic setting of the area includes the presence of an&#xD; ophiolitic block outcropping in the westernmost area on the African Plate, as well as basalts located to the North&#xD; and East on the Arabic Plate.&#xD; The diffuse presence of CO2-enriched gases, although diluted by the huge groundwater circulation, testifies a regional&#xD; degassing activity. Fluids circulating over the ophiolitic block are marked by H2-dominated gases with&#xD; abiogenic methane and high-pH waters. The measured 3He/4He isotopic ratios display contributions from both&#xD; crustal and mantle-derived sources over both sides of the DSF. Although the serpentinization process is generally&#xD; independent from mantle-type contribution, the recorded helium isotopic ratios highlight variable contents of&#xD; mantle-derived fluids. Due to the absence of recent volcanism over the western side of the basin (African&#xD; Plate), we argue that CO2-rich volatiles carrying mantle-type helium and enriched in heavy carbon, are degassed&#xD; by deep-rooted regional faults rather than from volcanic sources.</description>     <dc:date>2014-08-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9074\">     <title>La siccit\\ufffd\\ufffd e la disponibilit\\ufffd\\ufffd di acque sotterranee in Puglia</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9074</link>     <description>Title: La siccit\\ufffd\\ufffd e la disponibilit\\ufffd\\ufffd di acque sotterranee in Puglia Authors: Polemio, M.; CNR-IRPI, Bari; Dragone, V.; CNR-IRPI, Bari Abstract: Mediante l'utilizzo di metodi di statistica delle serie storiche \\ufffd\\ufffd stato possibile evidenziare alcuni caratteri degli acquiferi pugliesi, quali il regime piezometrico, i rapporti intercorrenti tra precipitazioni meteoriche, temperatura atmosferica e variazioni piezometriche.&#xD; La ricostruzione degli aspetti tendenziali, negli ultimi 30 anni, delle variazioni piezometriche ha mostrato un abbassamento considerevole della quota piezometrica in tutte le unit\\ufffd\\ufffd idrogeologiche, con valori pi\\ufffd\\ufffd accentuati per le aree interne della Murgia e del Tavoliere.&#xD; Gli elementi raccolti segnalano un progressivo depauperamento delle falde idriche proprio dove si concentrano le acque sotterranee di migliore qualit\\ufffd\\ufffd.

The most significant&#xD; variations were observed during the 1989\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1996 crisis due to a large input of steam and acidic gases from&#xD; depth. Besides chemical variations related to the input of deep fluids, the record of the water-table elevation at&#xD; monitored wells has provided remarkable insights into the pressure conditions of the volcano-hydrothermal&#xD; system. After the pressure drop due to the extensive vaporization of the hydrothermal aquifer, occurred after&#xD; 1993, the volcano-hydrothermal system has been re-pressurized since 2001, probably because of the contribution&#xD; of volatiles from the hydrothermal-magmatic source. The increase in fluid pressure may have caused&#xD; reopening of fractures (which had self-seated during the previous period of cooling) and the onset of a phase&#xD; of higher vapor output in the fumarole field later in 2004. The fracture opening would have promoted further&#xD; vapor separation from the deep fluid reservoir (hypothesized at 0.5\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1.5 km depth) and finally the drainage of&#xD; S-rich fluids into the shallow thermal aquifer (found out at few tens of meters of depth). The monitoring of&#xD; both the water chemistry and the water-table elevation provides insights into the eventual pressurization of&#xD; the volcano-hydrothermal system that precedes the fracture opening and the extensive drainage of deep fluids.&#xD; The findings of this study could represent crucial information about the stability of the volcano edifice, and lead to&#xD; reliable techniques for determining the risk of or even predicting phreatic explosions.</description>     <dc:date>2013-12-31T23:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9054\">     <title>The coastal hydrogeological system of Mar Piccolo (Ionian Sea, Italy)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9054</link>     <description>Title: The coastal hydrogeological system of Mar Piccolo (Ionian Sea, Italy) Authors: Zuffian\\ufffd\\ufffd, L.; Basso, A.; Casarano, D.; Dragone, V.; Limoni, P.P.; Santaloia, F.; Polemio, M. Abstract: The Mar Piccolo (literally \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnarrow sea\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd), a sea internal basin which is part of the Taranto Gulf, located along the Ionian coast in southern Italy (Apulia region), represents both a peculiar and sensitive environmental area and a national environmental and social emergency due to the level of sea water pollution due to the pollutants coming from the close industrial area of Taranto.&#xD; The area, located between the southern part of the Murgia plateau and the Ionian sea, is geologically characterized by a sequence of Mesozoic limestone (the Apulian carbonate platform) constituting the foreland of the southern Apennines chain. The Mesozoic sequence is intensely fissured and karstified, and forms an important groundwater reservoir.&#xD; The aquifer occurring in the carbonate sequence of the Murgia plateau feeds numerous coastal springs and constitute the main local source of pure fresh groundwater. &#xD; Galeso, Battentieri and Riso are the main subaerial springs located along the coast of Mar Piccolo, not far from the town of Taranto. This area is also characterized by several submarine springs, locally called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCitri\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.&#xD; Submarine freshwater discharge plays an important, though not well quantified, role in the hydrogeological equilibrium of the system, but also the source of the spreading of many pollutants in the Mar Piccolo area due to the close presence of one of the largest European steel mill together a number of hazardous industrial activities of other types.&#xD; The paper describes the efforts and the preliminary results to define a detailed conceptualisation of the aquifer as main support to characterise the hydrological balance of the internal sea and the quality of sea water and the effect on of the ecological equilibrium of the coastal environment.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9052\">     <title>A peculiar case of coastal springs and geogenic saline groundwater: the Santa Cesarea Terme thermal springs (Southern Italy)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9052</link>     <description>Title: A peculiar case of coastal springs and geogenic saline groundwater: the Santa Cesarea Terme thermal springs (Southern Italy) Authors: Polemio, M.; Limoni, P.P.; Liotta, D.; Palladino, G.; Santaloia, F.; Zuffian\\ufffd\\ufffd, L. Editors: Wiederhold, H.; Michaelsen, J.; Hinsby, K.; Nommensen, B. Abstract: Carbonate aquifers, located in foreland tectonic settings, could represent important thermal water resources outside the volcanic areas, supplying spas or geothermal installations. Thermal springs constitute the discharge areas of deep marine and continental groundwaters flowing within these carbonate aquifers whose hydraulic conductivity and the relevant geothermal fluid migration are strictly controlled by both the discontinuity network and the karst processes involving the foreland environment. An example of these springs occurs along the south-easternmost portion of the Apulia region (Southern Italy) where some sulphurous and warm waters (22-33 \\ufffd\\ufffdC) flow out in partially submerged caves located along the coast, thus supplying the spas of Santa Cesarea Terme.&#xD; These springs are known from ancient times (Aristotele in III century BC) and the physical-chemical features of their thermal waters resulted to be partly influenced by the sea level variations. Some hypotheses about the origin of these warm waters were proposed up to now by previous researches but some uncertainties still exist. For this reason, the area has been selected in order to define the conceptual model of the geothermal resources related to the thermal springs and, as a consequence, the origin of the thermal springs. It is one of the pilot site of the Vigor Project (Evaluation of the geothermal potential of Regions of Convergence), promoted by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development and National Research Council.&#xD; Santa Cesarea Terme zone is located within the Apulia carbonate platform, the foreland of the southern Apennines, which consists of Jurassic-Cretaceous limestones, thick more than 5 km in the study area and affected by intense karst processes, resting above the Late Triassic evaporite (Burano Fm) and, unconformably, overlaid by Cenozoic calcareous successions. Belonging to a coastal area, the studied groundwater, whose top is located almost to the sea level, is involved in saltwater intrusion and therefore the salt-fresh water interface occurs at some meters below the sea level moving inland. &#xD; Geological and hydrogeological surveys, including geo-electrical prospecting, and chemical and isotopic analyses of both groundwater and seawater have been carried out. Stable isotopes (\\ufffd\\ufffd18O, \\ufffd\\ufffdD) were used to define the origin of the thermal waters and the recharge mechanism of the geothermal systems while the unstable isotope (3H) was determined for estimating the age of the thermal waters and to define the conceptual model of this low temperature geothermal resource. &#xD; All the data have been analysed to improve the knowledge of the groundwater flow system, thus assessing the possibility of using low-temperature geothermal fluids to fulfil the thermal needs of the town of Santa Cesarea Terme.&#xD; In this narrow area, the source of geogenic salinization of spring groundwater was referred to ascending very deep groundwater, more saline than current sea water.The geochemical composition and the physical features of the sampled waters suggest that thermal waters should be moving from ancient seawaters subjected to intense evaporation processes, infiltrated at great depth within the seabed substratum. Afterwards, these thermal fluids should flow up through the almost vertical structures, related to the transtensional structures, identified within a narrow sector of the studied territory.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9051\">     <title>Hydrogeological model of a complex coastal aquifers: the case of Sibari Plain (Southern Italy)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9051</link>     <description>Title: Hydrogeological model of a complex coastal aquifers: the case of Sibari Plain (Southern Italy) Authors: De Rosa, R.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd della Calabria; Romanazzi, A.; CNR-IRPI, Bari; Apollaro, C.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd della Calabria; Cianflone, G.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd della Calabria; Vespasiano, G.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd della Calabria; Dominici, R.; Universit\\ufffd\\ufffd della Calabria; Molinari, P.; Agrinconsulting Roma; Polemio, M.; CNR-IRPI, Bari Editors: Wiederhold, H.; Michaelsen, J.; Hinsby, K.; Nommensen, B. Abstract: The increasing overexploitation of water resources is observed on a global scale in the previous decades; this trend involves the coastal regions of Mediterranean Basin (Van Beynen et alii, 2012). As an effect of increasing groundwater discharge from coastal aquifers, the phenomenon of seawater intrusion is becoming a serious problem for most of the coastal aquifers, especially in the Mediterranean area (COST, 2003; COST, 2005). The aim of this paper is to present the modeling of a coastal porous aquifer located in the complex plain of Sibari (Southern Italy), a plain deeply modified as an effect of reclamation works realized after thirties. The model was implemented using piezometric historical data (from thirties) to establish the effect of seawater intrusion when the well discharge was negligible (natural conditions), the modification in subsequent decades, to be used for forecasting purpose and for evaluate the evolution of groundwater resource. &#xD; The area actually represents a landscape with anthropic equilibrium based on the works of a land reclamation project (1960s-1990s). Study area is about 365 km2 for a coastline of about 35 km, about which an hydrogeological conceptual model was defined. The area can be conceptualized into three hydrogeological complexes (from the top): sand complex, a clay complex and a sand and conglomerate complex, constituting the deep aquifer, the bottom of which is not well-defined. Shallow aquifer is predominantly fed by direct rainwater infiltration. Deep aquifer is fed by outflows of the mountainous aquifers as the case of limestone aquifer of Pollino Mount,and of shallow granitic aquifer of the Sila massif (Guerricchio and Melidoro, 1975). The maximum piezometric levels of the deep aquifer are equivalent to approximately 40 m asl, so in some areas it presents artesian feature.&#xD; The computer codes selected for numerical groundwater modelling were MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh, 1998) and SEAWAT (Guo and Langevin, 2002). This groundwater flow modelling is based on the concept of a equivalent homogeneous porous medium by which it is assumed that the real heterogeneous aquifer can be simulated as homogeneous porous media within cells or elements (Anderson, 2002). &#xD; The modeled aquifer area was uniformly discretized, using Peclet number, into a finite difference grid of 97,735 cells of 240 m x 350 m. For the vertical discretization, model was divided into five layers of variable thicknesses, defined on the basis of a multi-methodological geological survey. Climatic, hydrological and agricultural data were processed to defines inputs for the numerical model based on the variable-density flow. An hydrological balance using  monthly and annual of 13 thermo-pluviometric stations falling in the study area, in the time period 1930-1975, was done  (Polemio and Casarano, 2008, Polemio et alii, 2013). The numerical model was calibrated with PEST code with a correlation coefficient equal to 0,90. Preliminary results of steady flow and of groundwater salinity spatial are now available and shows it is not sustainable in the case of shallow aquifer and it can be improved in the case of deep aquifer.</description>     <dc:date>2014-05-31T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9050\">     <title>Statistical analysis of rainfall, river  head and piezometric level data of central-Adriatic alluvial aquifers</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9050</link>     <description>Title: Statistical analysis of rainfall, river  head and piezometric level data of central-Adriatic alluvial aquifers Authors: Chiaudani, A.; Engineering and Geology Department \"InGeo\", \"G.

For this purpose measurements acquired every three days, relative to 1986-2009 period, concerning the Pescara river alluvial plain (Fig.1), were analyzed with several statistical methods. The alluvial bodies of the Pescara river is mainly silty-sandy. The plain aquifer is supported by Plio-Pleistocenic clayey deposits. The three wells (Fig. 2) are located in the medium-low alluvial plain. Autocorrelation and spectral univariate analysis, cross-correlation and bivariate spectral analysis have been implemented with the purpose to evaluate the memory effect, the delay of the piezometric level response to rainfall and river head/discharge impulse, and the periodical components of the time series (Mangin, 1984; Larocque et al., 1998; Polemio and Dragone, 1999).</description>     <dc:date>2014-06-17T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9049\">     <title>Climate change and Mediterranean coastal karst aquifers: the case of Salento (southern Italy)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2122/9049</link>     <description>Title: Climate change and Mediterranean coastal karst aquifers: the case of Salento (southern Italy) Authors: Polemio, M.; CNR-IRPI, Bari; Romanazzi, A.; CNR-IRPI, Bari Abstract: Second half of the 20th century was characterized by an increase of groundwater discharge. Numerous aquifers are overexploited in the world and in particular in the Mediterranean area. Problems tie to overexploitation, as piezometric decline and increase of seawater intrusion, are amplified in karst coastal aquifers where the whole effect could be a groundwater quality and quantity degradation.&#xD; Focusing on Mediterranean countries, most part of coastal aquifers of Spain, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Croatia, Greece, Albania, Turkey, and Italy are karstic and affected, to different degrees, by seawater intrusion due high pumping extraction rates and low recharge. (COST, 2005; Polemio et al., 2010). &#xD; Climate change may particularly aggravate these requirements, especially in the Mediterranean areas, due to the combined effects of semiarid condition climate, or reduced recharge and consequent increase of discharge (Cotecchia et al., 2003; Polemio 2005; Polemio et al., 2009).&#xD; The general purpose of this paper is to prove the capability of large-scale numerical models in management of groundwater, in particular for achieve forecast scenarios to evaluate the impacts of climate change on groundwater resources of karst coastal aquifer of Salento (Southern Italy).&#xD; The computer codes selected for numerical groundwater modelling were MODFLOW and SEAWAT. Three forecast transient scenarios, referred to 2001-2020, 2021-2040 and 2041-2060, were implemented, on the basis of calibrated and validated model, with the aim to predicting the evolution of piezometric level and seawater intrusion. The scenarios were discussed considering the effects of climate change, sea level rise and change of sea salinity.</description>     <dc:date>2014-06-17T22:00:00Z</dc:date>   </item> </rdf:RDF>  ",
