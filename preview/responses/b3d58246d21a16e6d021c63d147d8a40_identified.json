We are in a better position I hope with the Moodle upgrade, and with Mahara and Xerte arriving late but still offering huge improvements.

Each campus can have a separate theme and mixed front page content (some general things as well as local items. This follows a request in June and will be done over the weekend of 20th/21st. December. This will add some new features, and a whole new look. Moodle will also now automatically resize to work just as well on tablets and smartphones. Content, course structure and permissions will not be affected. There will be a new range of activities available that can be easily added.
