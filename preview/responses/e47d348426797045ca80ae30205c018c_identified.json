An             orthoimage is a uniform-scale image where corrections have been made for feature             displacement such as building tilt and for scale variations caused by terrain relief,             sensor geometry, and camera tilt. A mathematical equation based on ground control             points, sensor calibration information, and a digital elevation model is applied to each             pixel to rectify the image to obtain the geometric qualities of a map. A digital             orthoimage may be created from several photographs mosaicked to form the final image.             The source imagery may be black-and-white, natural color, color infrared, or color near             infrared (4-band) with a pixel resolution of 1-meter or finer. With orthoimagery, the             resolution refers to the distance on the ground represented by each pixel. There is no             image overlap between adjacent files. Data received at EROS were reprojected from source             projection to a standard utm projection and resolution resampled to align to the U.S.             National Grid (USNG) using The National Map. The naming convention is based on the USNG,             taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage. The metadata were imported             and updated for display through The National Map at http://nationalmap.gov/viewer.html             Image-level metadata are provided in HTML and XML format. Data were compressed utilizing             IAS software. The compression was JPEG2000 Lossy Compressed. The file format created was             .jp2.</abstract>          <purpose>A digital orthoimage is a geometrically accurate photographic record of landscape             conditions at the time of the corresponding aerial photography. As such, High Resolution             Orthoimagery is useful for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring,             facility engineering/maintenance, city/county planning, property line review, etc. The             digital orthoimage can be used alone or as a raster basemap for corresponding vector             line mapping. The detailed focus of High Resolution Orthoimagery provides emergency             responders critical information in determining the best evacuation routes, alternative             routes and safe access to aid. High Resolution Orthoimagery assists law enforcement             personnel in determining the best locations to place surveillance cameras in             high-traffic urban areas and popular attractions. The data assists Federal, State and             local emergency responders in planning for homeland security efforts. This data also             supports The National Map.</purpose>          <supplinf>The data obtained through The National Map is considered to be the \"best             available\" data from USGS.
