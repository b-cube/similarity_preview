Release Notes for Agar 1.4.1 ----------------------------  Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.4.0, in no particular order. A wikified version of this list is available at: http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.4.1.  - Port to Xbox (thanks Michael J. Wood!). - Widget code can now use the AG_Redraw() and AG_RedrawOn*() interfaces to   trigger rendering. The generic event loop uses this information to avoid   unnecessary video updates -- custom event loops should be modified to   test for the window \"dirty\" flag to take advantage of this feature. - Fixed compilation with --disable-legacy option. - Implemented AG_SurfaceFromPNG() and AG_SurfaceFromJPEG(). - Fixed crash bug in AG_SurfaceFromSDL(); thanks trapdoor! - Added AG_SetJPEGQuality(), to set quality used by AG_SurfaceExportJPEG(). - Merge --enable-{class,event}debug into --enable-objdebug; remove lockdebug. - Upgrade build system to BSDBuild 2.8. Note that stale ./agar-config/ and   ./agar-foo-config/ directories may break the build and should be removed   before ./configure is executed. - Fix deadlock condition with the AG_Timeout interface when timers are   scheduled in reverse order; thanks to Jakob Reschke for the fix! - Fixed UTF8 conversion bug with 3-byte sequences; thanks Jerry Huang! - Fixed coordinates offset for popup menus under single-window drivers. - Numerous improvements to the API reference. Added AG_DriverGLX(3),   AG_DriverWGL(3), AG_DriverSDLFB(3), AG_DriverSDLGL(3), AG_DriverMw(3)   and AG_DriverSw(3), AG_InitGraphics(3) manual pages. - Fixed crash bug with AG_TEXTBOX_STATIC and AG_EDITABLE_STATIC. - Added \"STRUCTURE DATA\" section to AG_Window(3). - Added missing SDL_LockSurface() calls in sdlfb/sdlgl drivers. - AG_InitGraphics() can now accept driver initialization arguments. - Avoid use of gettimeofday() on cygwin platform. - MATH: Fix type conversion warnings. - Implemented AG_DirDlg(3) directory selection widget. - Implemented AG_Anim(3) interface. - WGL: Terminate application by exiting the event loop instead of   using exit(). - In AG_Scrollbar(3), implement AG_SCROLLBAR_AUTOHIDE option. - Fix compilation issues under MinGW / MSYS (thanks Joergen!) - WGL: Post a \"window-gainfocus\" event when a window is focused for   the first time on creation. &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Agar Announcements</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2011-03-21T03:38:04</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.agar.announce/6\">     <title>Agar-1.4.0 released</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.agar.announce/6</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt; I am pleased to announce the immediate release of Agar-1.4.0. The source code and some precompiled packages are now available for download at:  http://libagar.org/download.html  Release Notes for Agar 1.4.0 (\"Landscapes of Frozen Methane\") -------------------------------------------------------------  Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.3.4, in no particular order. A wikified version of this list is available at: http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.4.0.  This release preserves backward compatibility with Agar 1.3.4, but it is recommended to compile Agar with the `--disable-legacy' configure option, ensuring that existing applications are not using deprecated API calls.  - Added support for multiple native windows; rework of the low-level graphics   and input device interfaces. As of this release, the available drivers are:   - \"glx\" (GL rendering via X Window System; multiple windows)   - \"wgl\" (GL rendering under Windows; multiple windows)   - \"sdlfb\" (framebuffer rendering via SDL; internal WM)   - \"sdlgl\" (GL rendering via SDL; internal WM)   New drivers can also be implemented as part of an application, the driver   API is documented in AG_Driver(3). - Applications should now use AG_InitGraphics() to initialize the graphical   interface. Backward compatibility is preserved, but AG_InitVideo() will   only select among single-window graphics drivers. - Agar can now be built without the SDL library, where the SDL graphics   driver is not needed. - Many improvements to the AG_Surface(3) interface. - Implement generic AG_Keyboard and AG_Mouse interfaces; allow for multiple   input devices. - Implement widget \"actions\" as a generic method of handling mouse and   keyboard actions per user preferences (see AG_Widget(3)/ACTIONS). - Agar windows are now attached and detached using AG_ObjectAttach() and   AG_ObjectDetach() against a parent AG_Driver(3); the AG_ViewDetach()   function is now deprecated. - Added AG_Tbl(3), AG_Tree(3) interfaces to ag_core. - Fix handling of dynamically-allocated strings in AG_CopyVariable(). - Implement AG_TlistUniq(), AG_TlistAddHead(). - Important optimizations to AG_LookupClass(). - Consistently provide plain string variants for every function accepting   format string arguments. This allows for more efficient code, and avoids   complications with language bindings. - As the \"window-*\" prefixes in events such as \"window-mousemotion\" is no   longer relevant, mark them deprecated in favor of \"mouse-*\" and \"key-*\". - The integer typedefs Uint8, Sint8, Uint16, Sint16, etc. are no longer   made public unless _USE_AGAR_TYPES is explicitely defined. &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Agar Announcements</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2010-04-16T15:52:52</dc:date>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.agar.announce/5\">     <title>Agar-1.3.4 released</title>     <link>http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.agar.announce/5</link>     <description>&lt;pre&gt; I am pleased to announce the official release of Agar 1.3.4. The source code and some precompiled packages are now available for download at:  http://libagar.org/download.html  Release Notes for Agar 1.3.4 (Pandemonic Incantation) -----------------------------------------------------  Here are some of the most notable changes since Agar 1.3.3, in no particular order. A wikified version of this list is available at: http://wiki.libagar.org/wiki/Agar-1.3.4.  - Continued improvements to the API reference. - Overall improved handling of out-of-memory conditions. - Implement simpler, unified AG_Variable(3) interface at the AG_Object(3)   level in ag_core. This renders the AG_Widget(3)-level \"AG_WidgetBinding\"   and the \"AG_Prop\" interfaces obsolete, as well as the AG_Event(3) argument   lists, which all used different structures and interfaces. Backwards   compatibility is preserved. - GUI: Implemented word-wrapping in AG_Editable(3) and AG_Textbox(3). Thanks   to CoKinetic Systems (http://www.cokinetic.com/) for sponsoring this feature! - Perl XS bindings improved to the level that they are now useful, thanks to   Mat Sutcliffe! - Continued improvements to the Ada bindings; added ada-demos/   (thanks rothwell!) - Remove unnecessary --disable-utf8 switch, always use Unicode. - Removed DEV_GuiDebugger() from ag_dev library. Reimplemented a more useful   debugging tool, AG_GuiDebugger(), in ag_gui itself. - Fixed font engine initialization/clean-up issue which prevented Agar from   being destroyed and re-initialized later (thanks naiina!) - CORE: Eliminate unnecessary list traversals when scheduling timeouts.   AG_ScheduleTimeout() is now preferred over AG_AddTimeout() and   ReplaceTimeout(). - CORE: Added AG_LookupDSO() to AG_DSO(3) interface. - CORE: Added public AG_ObjectReadHeader() routine, for checking object file   metadata prior to loading. - CORE: Added AG_Time(3) interface. - CORE: Implemented support for database-bound objects with AG_Db(3) and   AG_DbObject(3). - CORE: Added AG_List(3) interface to complement AG_Variable(3). - CORE: Agar datafiles now support debugging information and optional runtime   type-safety. Added agar-disasm utility for dumping contents of Agar   object datafiles with debug information (see AG_SetSourceDebug()). - CORE: Implemented \"AutoCore\" (dynamically-grown memory) data source into   AG_DataSource(3). - CORE: Much improved error handling in AG_DataSource(3). Added   AG_DataSourceSetErrorFn(), and error-return variants for all standard   AG_ReadFoo() routines. - CORE: Added simpler AG_ConfigLoad() and AG_ConfigSave(). - Merged NS/NC library (\"ag_net\") into ag_core. - Updated build system components with latest BSDBuild   (http://bsdbuild.hypertriton.com/). - GUI: Added widget: AG_FontSelector(3). - GUI: Added widget: AG_Scrollview(3). - GUI: Added widget: AG_Treetbl(3) (based on previous \"AG_Tableview\"). - GUI: Added advisory AG_Widget(3) flag AG_WIDGET_TABLE_EMBEDDABLE. - GUI: Added AG_TextFontPts(), AG_TextFontPct(), AG_TextFontLookup(),   AG_TextValign(), AG_ButtonValign(). - Fixes to AG_Label(3) clipping when partially occluded. - GUI: Added AG_TextInfo() (similar to AG_TextWarning(), with disable key). - GUI: Cosmetic fixes in AG_Menu(3). - GUI: Implemented AG_InitGUI(), AG_QuitGUI(). - GUI: Implemented AG_VIDEO_OVERLAY option to simplify rendering of Agar GUI   elements over an existing OpenGL scene when a custom event loop is needed. - GUI: Avoid the slow recursive searches needed by functions such as   AG_WindowUpdate() by storing a \"window\" pointer in the Widget structure. - GUI: Clean up focus-related code. Allow AG_WidgetFocus() to fail. Add   separate AG_WidgetIsFocusedInWindow() routine in addition to   AG_WidgetIsFocused(). - GUI: Fix a potential problem on platforms where the GL context is lost   following a window resize. - GUI: Allow widgets to request geometry updates asynchronously with   AG_WidgetUpdate(). This avoids redundant, expensive searches. Use of   AG_WindowUpdate() within widget implementations is now strongly deprecated. - GUI: Fix incorrect parsing of \"Npx\" size specifications in   AG_WidgetParseSizeSpec(). - GUI: Implement AG_WidgetSurface(), for rendering widgets to an AG_Surface(3). - GUI: Fix improper initialization and cleanup of embedded widget cells,   improve handling of out-of-memory conditions. - GUI: Fix scrolling behavior of AG_Console(3), add AG_ConsoleClear(),   AG_ConsoleMsgIcon() and AG_ConsoleMsgPtr(). - Removed remaining SDL dependencies in GUI rendering code and ag_core. - GUI: Use stippled polygons in GL mode for \"disabled\" widget controls. Add   AG_DrawArrowLeft(), AG_DrawArrowRight(). - GUI: Embed AG_Label(3) in AG_Button(3) instead of rendering text. Added   constructors AG_ButtonNewUint{8,16,32}(). - GUI: Embed AG_Label(3) in AG_Checkbox(3) instead of rendering text. - GUI: Some small optimizations to text rendering system. - GUI: Cosmetic fixes to decorative window frames and rendering of \"resize\"   controls. - GUI: Added auto-completion and pattern matching support in   AG_FileDlg(3) on platforms where glob(3) is available. - GUI: AG_FileDlg(3) now displays OS-specific directory shortcuts. Display   drive letters on win32. - GUI: AG_Slider(3): added AG_SliderNewFooR constructor variants, added   AG_SliderSetControlSize(). - GUI: Implemented AG_PixmapFromTexture() constructor and   AG_PixmapFooCurrentSurface in the AG_Pixmap(3) widget. - GUI: Added support for caption text in AG_Box(3). - GUI: Added AG_HSVPAL_NOALPHA and AG_HSVPAL_NOPREVIEW options to AG_HSVPal(3). - GUI: Added AG_WIDGET_NOSPACING flag to request that parent container widgets   do not apply spacing around the widget. - GUI: The polling rate of AG_Tlist(3) is now controllable with   AG_TlistSetRefresh() and AG_TlistRefresh(). Added AG_TlistScrollToStart()   and AG_TlistScrollToEnd() routines. - GUI: Added AG_TableSetColHeight(), AG_TableSetRowHeight(),   AG_TableSetColMin(), AG_TableSetSelectionMode() and   AG_TableSetSelectionColor(). - GUI: Added AG_RadioNewUint(). Fixed clipping in AG_Radio(3). - GUI: Added AG_ProgressBarNewInt(). - GUI: Implicitely glPushAttrib(GL_TRANSFORM_BIT) in AG_GLView(3). - GUI: Rework of the \"modal window\" system to keep modal windows in a stack.   This fixes a bug that would occur with cascading modal windows (e.g., a   modal window created from an event handler of another modal window). - GUI: Rework of the logic responsible for cycling focus between widgets with   the \"tab\" key. The new version is more efficient and fixes focusing bugs   that would occur when using certain container configurations. - GUI: Added public AG_WindowFocusAtPos() (was previously an internal). - GUI: Implemented AG_WindowSetGeometryRect(), AG_WindowSetMinSizePct(),   AG_WindowSetSideBorders(), AG_WindowSetBottomBorder(). - GUI: Fixed many issues with AG_Pane(3). AG_PaneMoveDivider() now   works pre-WindowShow(), added AG_PaneMoveDividerPct(). Fixed incorrect   documentation of the AG_PANE_DIV flag (actually divides area by two).   Added AG_PANE_UNMOVABLE option. The divider is now resizable to 0 pixels. - VG: Fixed rendering of VG_Polygon(3). - VG: Implemented general-purpose \"select\" tool (adapted from Edacious). - VG: Added VG_ViewSetScalePreset(), VG_ClearEditAreas(), VG_EditNode(),   VG_DrawSurface(), VG_ToolCommandExec() to VG_View(3) widget. Improvements   to \"text\" tool, such as font selection. - VG: Library is now usable without Agar-GUI. - VG: Added VG_Merge(). - VG: Added variable substitution and removed complex parser from \"polled\" - VG_Text element, thanks to the new AG_Variable(3) system. - VG: Added missing manual pages. - MATH: The math library is now official and documented; see AG_Intro(3). &lt;/pre&gt;</description>     <dc:creator>Agar Announcements</dc:creator>     <dc:date>2009-08-30T15:13:53</dc:date>   </item>   <textinput rdf:about=\"http://search.gmane.org/?group=$group=gmane.comp.lib.agar.announce\">     <title>Search Engine</title>     <description>Search the mailing list at Gmane</description>     <name>query</name>     <link>http://search.gmane.org/?group=$group=gmane.comp.lib.agar.announce</link>   </textinput> </rdf:RDF> ",
