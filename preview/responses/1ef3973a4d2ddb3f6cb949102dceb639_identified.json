Over 120 variables were selected from original Census sources, and more than 100 variables were derived from those component variables. The variables characterize geographic areas in terms of ethnicity, family structures, income, education, labor force activity, and housing. The geographic areas chosen range from neighborhoods (tracts, Block Numbering Areas [BNAs], and Enumeration Districts [EDs]), through intermediate levels of geography (Minor Civil Divisions and Census County Divisions [MCDs/CCDs], census places, and ZIP codes), through large economic areas (counties, Metropolitan Statistical Areas, State Economic Areas [SEAs], and specially created Labor Market Areas [LMAs]), and beyond to large regions (Economic Sub-Regions [ESRs] and states). To the maximum extent possible, the investigator selected Census variables that seemed relevant to problems associated with poverty and income determination and that were present in comparable form in the 1970 and 1980 Census datasets.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1990\" cycle=\"P1\">1990</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1990-04\" cycle=\"P1\">1990-04</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Population of the United States (which includes all 50 states and Washington, DC).</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          CENSUS OF POPULATION AND HOUSING, 1990 SUMMARY TAPE FILES 3A (ICPSR 9782) and 3B (ICPSR 6116)             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>               <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR02889.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
