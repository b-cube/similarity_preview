It is   similar to national social surveys conducted regularly in the United   States, Britain, and West Germany, and much of the data are directly   comparable. The questionnaire covers attitudes toward a broad range of   topics, including government expenditures, taxation, inflation, crime,   poverty, women and careers, migrants, political figures, and confidence   in institutions such as banks and police. Other questions relate to the   respondent's personal feelings about life, health, religion, moral   issues, and family relationships. Political and economic data provided   include party preference and voting history, income, and occupation.   Additional background variables are available on education, birthplace,   ethnic origin, religion, age, sex, location and size of town of  residence, marital status, and union membership.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1984\" cycle=\"P1\">1984</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1984-06\" cycle=\"P1\">1984-06</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1986-07\" cycle=\"P1\">1986-07</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Australia</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>Noninstitutionalized persons aged 18 years or older,   capable of being interviewed in English, in all States and Territories  of Australia.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Stratified area-cluster sample.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews, and self-enumerated forms             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 The data contain a weight variable.
