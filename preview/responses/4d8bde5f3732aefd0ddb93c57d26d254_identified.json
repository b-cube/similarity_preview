Additional reference data sets included Mr SID CIR Imagery of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway from www.atlas.lsu.edu, TIGER Line shapefiles of roads in Louisiana and Florida from www.geographynetwork.com and road and railroad shapefiles in Mississippi from MARIS. Maptech's Digital Chart Kit, Regions 8 and 17 featuring NOAA Digital Charts and a text description of the 72 COLREGS Demarcation lines from www.navcen.uscg.gov/mwv/regulations/33CFR080/33CFR80_GCD08.htm were also used. These additional layers were used to designate boundaries on individual units as dictated by the critical habitat designations described in the Federal Register Document.Inland units were created by digitizing a polygon slightly larger than the water body it represented. The new polygons were then \"edit clipped\" to the shoreline to exactly match the shoreline. In areas where the entire water body was not included, the boundaries were drawn following the feature described in Federal Register document. (Ex. The Lake Pontchartrain Causeway was digitized from the Mr SID's and used as the western boundary of the polygon. Bays with adjacent rivers or bayous that were excluded had their boundaries created by drawing a straight line across the river's mouth as dictated by the Document.) Every effort was made to exclude features at locations consistent with the descriptions in the Document.Near shore units were created by creating a 1 nautical mile buffer of the coastline (9nm in the case of the Suwannee Sound) or barrier island as indicated by the Document. The seaward side of these buffers was used as the southern boundary of the units. For the passes between islands, line segments were digitized to represent the 72 COLREGS Demarcation lines and 1 nautical mile buffers were created from those lines. Those buffers were merged with the buffers of the islands to complete the southern boundaries of the units. Every effort was made to accurately follow the descriptions of the 72 COLREGS lines. Whenever coordinates were used in the description, those coordinates were used in the creation of the buffers. When no coordinates were given, the lines/buffers were created by following the descriptions in the text.The Maptech software was used primarily as a guide to locate areas by name. The digital charts were also useful for accuracy evaluation in placement of the 72 COLREGS lines, as they were visible on the charts and could be compared to the lines digitized from text descriptions.</procdesc>         <srcused>Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Department of the Interior and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Department of Commerce - Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designation of Critical Habitat for the Gulf Sturgeon, [Docket No.; I.D&gt; 020522156-3051-02]</srcused>         <procdate>20031223</procdate>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntorgp>               <cntorg>National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC)</cntorg>               <cntper>Chris Henton</cntper>             </cntorgp>             <cntpos>GIS Analyst/Metadata Specialist</cntpos>             <cntaddr>               <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype>               <city>Stennis Space Center</city>               <state>MS</state>               <postal>39529</postal>               <country>US</country>             </cntaddr>             <cntvoice>228-688-2354</cntvoice>             <cntfax>228-688-2968</cntfax>             <cntemail>chris.henton@noaa.gov</cntemail>             <hours>Monday - Friday, 8:00am - 5:00pm</hours>           </cntinfo>         </proccont>       </procstep>     </lineage>   </dataqual>   <spdoinfo>     <direct>Vector</direct>     <ptvctinf>       <sdtsterm>         <sdtstype>GT-polygon composed of chains</sdtstype>         <ptvctcnt>7</ptvctcnt>       </sdtsterm>     </ptvctinf>   </spdoinfo>   <spref>     <horizsys>       <geograph>         <latres>8.9831528411952133e-009</latres>         <longres>8.9831528411952133e-009</longres>         <geogunit>Decimal Degrees</geogunit>       </geograph>       <geodetic>         <horizdn>D North American 1983</horizdn>         <ellips>GRS 1980</ellips>         <semiaxis>6378137.0</semiaxis>         <denflat>298.257222101</denflat>       </geodetic>     </horizsys>   </spref>   <eainfo>     <detailed>       <enttyp>         <enttypl>Gulf_sturgeon_Critical_Habitat_Unit8_14</enttypl>         <enttypd>Critical Habitat Units 8-14 (Coastal) for Gulf Sturgeon </enttypd>         <enttypds>NCDDC </enttypds>       </enttyp>       <attr>         <attrlabl>FID </attrlabl>         <attrdef>Internal feature number. </attrdef>         <attrdefs>ESRI </attrdefs>         <attrdomv>           <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated. </udom>         </attrdomv>       </attr>       <attr>         <attrlabl>Shape </attrlabl>         <attrdef>Feature geometry. </attrdef>         <attrdefs>ESRI </attrdefs>         <attrdomv>           <udom>Coordinates defining the features. </udom>         </attrdomv>       </attr>       <attr>         <attrlabl>Unit_Num </attrlabl>         <attrdef>Number of Critical Habitat Unit as described in the Federal Register.</attrdef>         <attrdefs>NCDDC </attrdefs>         <attrdomv>           <udom>Critical Habitat Unit Number </udom>         </attrdomv>       </attr>       <attr>         <attrlabl>Name </attrlabl>         <attrdef>Name of physical location of designated unit </attrdef>         <attrdefs>NCDDC </attrdefs>         <attrdomv>           <udom>Name used for identification purposes </udom>         </attrdomv>       </attr>       <attr>         <attrlabl>Name_2 </attrlabl>         <attrdef>Assigned Unit Number used for label purposes </attrdef>         <attrdefs>NCDDC </attrdefs>         <attrdomv>           <udom>Critical Habitat Unit Number </udom>         </attrdomv>       </attr>       <attr>         <attrlabl>Label</attrlabl>       </attr>     </detailed>   </eainfo>   <metainfo>     <metd>20131126</metd>     <metc>       <cntinfo>         <cntorgp>           <cntorg>Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)</cntorg>           <cntper>Amanda Frick</cntper>         </cntorgp>         <cntpos>GIS Coordinator</cntpos>         <cntaddr>           <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype>           <address>263 13th Ave S</address>           <city>St. Petersburg</city>           <state>FL</state>           <postal>33701</postal>           <country>US</country>         </cntaddr>         <cntvoice>727-824-5312</cntvoice>         <cntfax>727-824-5309</cntfax>         <cntemail>nmfs.ser.gis.coordinator@noaa.gov</cntemail>       </cntinfo>     </metc>     <metstdn>FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata</metstdn>     <metstdv>FGDC-STD-001-1998</metstdv>     <mettc>local time</mettc>   </metainfo> </metadata>",
