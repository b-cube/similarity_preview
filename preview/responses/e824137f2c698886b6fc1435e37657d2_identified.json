The project was designed to capture the extent to which respondents experience the affective and cognitive qualities of life, focusing on their assessments of their own lives as well as their relationships to family, neighborhood, workplace, social institutions, political institutions, and the marketplace. Attitudes toward development, democracy, and regionalization were examined, as were the types of goods and services desired and consumer habits. Respondents were queried on their overall personal satisfaction as well as their satisfaction with their friendships, family life, marriage, standard of living, housing, household income, health, education, neighbors, job, leisure time, public safety, the condition of the environment, the social welfare system, and the political system. Data were gathered on the respondents' personal priorities and those they had for their children, as well as their level of trust in others, their inclination to help others, and what characteristics and affiliations they used to identify themselves. Respondents were asked to rate the efficacy of their national governments in handling the economy, political corruption, human rights, unemployment, crime, public services, immigration, ethnic conflict, religious conflict, and environmental problems. Additional questions asked whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, what type of political systems respondents favored, and the extent to which the national government, the local government, the army, the legal system, the police, the national legislative branch (e.g., Parliament, Congress), the public education system, large domestic companies, multinational companies, trade/labor unions, the media, and other nongovernmental organizations (e.g., environmental, social advocacy groups, nonprofit organizations) could be trusted to operate in the best interest of society. Participants were asked which macro-socioeconomic issues they were most concerned with and what matters they believed the government should spend more or less on. Respondents were polled on their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, the inclusiveness of the government, and their perspectives on the importance of political and electoral participation. Additional questions addressed respondent exposure to and opinions of foreign companies, peoples, governments, and cultures. Market analysis inquiries included what products respondents owned, planned to own in the near future, or desired to own, as well as what consumer services they had used or would like to use. Respondents were asked about their modes of transportation, their current types of residence, whether or not they planned to own their own residences, and the availability of public utilities. Respondents were surveyed on what foreign and domestic companies they were familiar with and which forms of media they used to obtain consumer and political information. Background information includes age, sex, occupation, employment status, household income, family structure, number of people in household, number of children, education, marital status, English proficiency, religious affiliation, and religious participation.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"2003\" cycle=\"P1\">2003</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2003-06\" cycle=\"P1\">2003-06</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2003-09\" cycle=\"P1\">2003-09</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Asia</geogCover>             <geogCover>China (Peoples Republic)</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>             <geogCover>India</geogCover>             <geogCover>Japan</geogCover>             <geogCover>Malaysia</geogCover>             <geogCover>Myanmar</geogCover>             <geogCover>South Korea</geogCover>             <geogCover>Sri Lanka</geogCover>             <geogCover>Thailand</geogCover>             <geogCover>Uzbekistan</geogCover>             <geogCover>Vietnam (Socialist Republic)</geogCover>                         <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>Citizens of China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Myanmar, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam who were between 20 and 59 years of age.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Various forms of multistage, stratified, clustered,  national probability sampling were used in each country studied.
