They represent an automated version of the Minnesota Geological Survey State Map Series Map S-3 (Hydrogeologic Map of Minnesota: Quaternary Hydrogeology), 1979, by Roman Kanivetsky  (1:500,000). The Quaternary Hydrogeology file was created by digitizing the  the 1:500,000-scale paper map. The 'Quaternary Hydrogeology - Materials' and 'Quaternary Hydrogeology - Yield' layers were then created based on attributes assigned to the file. The Arc coverages were also converted into  EPPL 40-acre grid cell files.</abstract> <purpose>To produce  general descriptive information on surficial hydrogeology for the state.</purpose> <supplinf>Minnesota, Statewide</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1979</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Map was delineated in 1979 based on the subsurface information available at the time.</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress></progress> <update>None planned</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-97.5</westbc> <eastbc>-89.0</eastbc> <northbc>49.5</northbc> <southbc>43.0</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt></themekt> <themekey>Geology, Hydrogeology, Surficial Hydrogeology, Quaternary Hydrogeology, Subsurface Hydrology, Water Resources, Ground Water</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekey>Minnesota, Statewide</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None</accconst> <useconst>Credit to the Minnesota Geological Survey for 'Hydrogeologic Map of Minnesota: Quaternary Hydrogeology', MGS Map S-3, 1979, by Roman Kanivetsky.

Map is available from the Minnesota Geological Survey Bookstore  (612) 627-4782.  Other maps and associated data sets at statewide scale include Bedrock Geology, Bedrock Hydrogeology,  and Quaternary Geology.    In EPPL Grid format these data layers are also part of the LMIC MGC100 data set on CD. These include the main file for Quaternary Hydrogeology HYDQGEO.EPP, and derived files HYDQMAT.EPP, HYDQYIEL.EPP, and HYDQBOW.EPP.  File descriptions and legends for the EPPL files are otherwise as described in the Entity and Attribute section.</title> </citeinfo> </crossref> </idinfo> <dataqual> <attracc> <attraccr>Attribute coding has been verified.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic></logic> <complete>Complete, statewide.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar></horizpar> </horizpa> <vertacc> <vertaccr></vertaccr> </vertacc> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srcscale>500000</srcscale> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc>The Quaternary Hydrogeology Map was digitized by LMIC into an Arc/INFO polygon coverage (HYDQGEO)  from  the 1:500,000-scale paper map.  File was converted from the original Lambert Conformal projection of the base map to UTM, Zone 15 extended, NAD27.  Staff manually added attributes for materials and yield which were represented on the paper map. These attributes were then used with the Arc/Info 'DISSOLVE' command to create the Materials (HYDQMAT) and the Yield (HYDQYIEL) layers. The files were later converted from single precision, NAD27, shifted, to double precision, NAD83 unshifted, using the Arc 'PROJECT' command.  The EPPL files  (HYDQGEO.EPP, HYDQMAT.EPP, and HYDQYIEL.EPP) were created from the Arc Covers using the 'POLYGRID' command with a 40-acre cell size.  NOTE that there is also a 'Buried Outwash' file (HYDQBOW.EPP) on the EPPL data set. This attribute was originally digitized off the basemap and coded with an attribute. This file could be re-created from the EPPL file, if needed, or redigitized. The Buried Outwash file consists of 12-15 polygons spread across the state, with yield rating values (in gallons per minute) as an attribute.</procdesc> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref></indspref> <direct>Vector</direct> <mgmg3obj>Point, Vector, Polygon</mgmg3obj> <mgmg3til>None.

Note that, for the Materials and Yield coverages, the Non-Aquifer portions of the state are classified as '0' and therefore are part of the state's 'outer polygon' in arc/info. Thus there is no state boundary contained on these two files.</eadetcit> </overview> </eainfo> <distinfo> <distrib> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Susanne Maeder</cntper> <cntorg>Land Management Information Center, Minnesota Planning</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>GIS Data Coordinator</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype> Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>300 Centennial Building; 658 Cedar Street</address> <city>St. Paul</city> <state>Minnesota</state> <postal>55155</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>651.201.2488</cntvoice> <cntfax>651.296.3698</cntfax> <cntemail>clearinghouse@mnplan.state.mn.us</cntemail> </cntinfo> </distrib> <resdesc>hydqgeo</resdesc> <distliab>Limitations: Although extensive effort has been made to produce error free and complete data, all geographic information has limitations due to the scale, resolution, date and interpretation of the original source materials.
