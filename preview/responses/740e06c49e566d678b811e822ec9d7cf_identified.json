L.; Reed, S. B.; Culley, D. E.; Romine, M. R.; Geesey, Gill G. The iron-reducing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 has the capacity to contribute to iron cycling over the long term by respiring on crystalline iron oxides such as hematite when poorly crystalline phases are depleted. The ability of outer membrane cytochromes OmcA and MtrC of MR-1 to bind to and transfer electrons to hematite has led to the suggestion that they function as terminal reductases when this mineral is used as a respiratory substrate. Differences in their redox behavior and hematite-binding properties, however, indicate that they play different roles in the electron transfer reaction. Here, we investigated how these differences in cytochrome behavior with respect to hematite affected biofilm development when the mineral served as terminal electron acceptor (TEA). Upon attachment to hematite, cells of the wild-type (WT) strain as well as those of a DomcA mutant but not those of a DmtrC mutant replicated and accumulated on the mineral surface. The results indicate that MtrC but not OmcA is required for growth when this mineral serves as TEA. While an OmcA deficiency did not impede cell replication and accumulation on hematite prior to achievement of a maximum surface cell density comparable to that established by WT cells, OmcA was required for efficient electron transfer and cell attachment to hematite once maximum surface cell density was achieved. OmcA may therefore play a role in overcoming barriers to electron transfer and cell attachment to hematite imposed by reductive dissolution of the mineral surface fromcell respiration associated with achievement of high surface cell densities.

Such \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdglacier-like forms\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (GLFs) are strikingly similar to&#13; alpine valley glaciers found on Earth. These martian GLFs are believed to be&#13; composed of massive water ice but little is known about how they formed, how they&#13; evolve, and how they interact with the martian surface. This thesis presents various&#13; studies of Mars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd mid-latitude GLFs that were designed to address some of these&#13; issues. New observations and new results were obtained using survey and mapping&#13; techniques.&#13; The findings presented in this thesis suggest that GLFs, observed ubiquitously in&#13; Mars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd mid-latitudes, are all composed of a similar material and were formed in a&#13; similar way, most likely under Earth-like \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmass-balance\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd conditions whereby ice&#13; accumulated at altitude and subsequently flowed, under its own weight, downhill and&#13; into an ablation zone where GLFs experienced net mass loss. It is likely these&#13; conditions existed on Mars during a past martian ice age.&#13; From their geographical distribution (relative to latitude, elevation and relief) it would&#13; appear that those GLFs that remain on Mars today are relict deposits that have&#13; survived where local conditions impair ablation, and that these residual GLFs appear&#13; currently to flow under the influence of local relief and gravity. From the examination&#13; of crevasse patterns it appears that this flow occurs under an englacial strain regime&#13; similar to that which commonly defines spatial flow patterns in terrestrial glaciers.&#13; This thesis also observes and identifies various small-scale features and textures&#13; that suggest that the evolution and subsequent flow of GLFs has been (or may&#13; currently be) sensitive to many environmental factors common on Earth, such as the&#13; agency of liquid water. This suggests that GLFs (and possibly other associated ice&#13; masses) may have been significant movers and shapers of Mars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd surface sediments&#13; and structures, contributing widely to the evolution of Mars\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd present-day surface. </description> <dc:date>2013-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13168\"> <title>Bacterially Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation and Strontium Coprecipitation in a Porous Media Flow System</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/13168</link> <description>Bacterially Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation and Strontium Coprecipitation in a Porous Media Flow System Lauchnor, Ellen G.; Schultz, Logan N.; Bugni, Steven; Mitchell, Andrew Charles; Cunningham, Alfred B.; Gerlach, Robin Strontium-90 is a principal radionuclide contaminant in the subsurface at several Department of Energy sites in the Western U.S., causing a threat to groundwater quality in areas such as Hanford, WA. In this work, we used laboratory-scale porous media flow cells to examine a potential remediation strategy employing coprecipitation of strontium in carbonate minerals. CaCO3 precipitation and strontium coprecipitation were induced via ureolysis by Sporosarcina pasteurii in two-dimensional porous media reactors. An injection strategy using pulsed injection of calcium mineralization medium was tested against a continuous injection strategy. The pulsed injection strategy involved periods of lowered calcite saturation index combined with short high fluid velocity flow periods of calcium mineralization medium followed by stagnation (no-flow) periods to promote homogeneous CaCO3 precipitation. By alternating the addition of mineralization and growth media the pulsed strategy promoted CaCO3 precipitation while sustaining the ureolytic culture over time. Both injection strategies achieved ureolysis with subsequent CaCO3 precipitation and strontium coprecipitation. The pulsed injection strategy precipitated 71\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd85% of calcium and 59% of strontium, while the continuous injection was less efficient and precipitated 61% of calcium and 56% of strontium. Over the 60 day operation of the pulsed reactors, ureolysis was continually observed, suggesting that the balance between growth and precipitation phases allowed for continued cell viability. Our results support the pulsed injection strategy as a viable option for ureolysis-induced strontium coprecipitation because it may reduce the likelihood of injection well accumulation caused by localized mineral plugging while Sr coprecipitation efficiency is maintained in field-scale applications.
