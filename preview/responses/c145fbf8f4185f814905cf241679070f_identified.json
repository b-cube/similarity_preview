Here, we apply multivariate statistical analyses to data acquired in 2004 from several complementary survey methods that operate at different scales of spatial and taxonomic resolution to characterize the coral communities in 5 habitats, 3 of which are further stratified by geographic sector or depth zone. Coral cover is highest in the small lagoon pool inside the southeast vertex of the perimeter reef, followed by the fore reef, patch reefs, reef flat, and lagoon slope. Benthic communities are more highly variable on the fore reef, but the coral cover and colony abundances are less dominated by a few key genera than in other habitats. While the relative representation of coral taxa varies among habitats, Porites, Fungia, Pocillopora, Sinularia, Turbinaria, Acropora, and Favia all contribute &amp;gt; 10% of the total coral cover in at least one habitat. We provide a list of 188 anthozoan and hydrozoan corals observed at Kingman Reef during survey activities since the year 2000. Coral diversity at Kingman is similar to that at Palmyra Atoll to the south but is high compared to other adjacent atolls and reef islands to the south and west (Phoenix and Line Islands) where data are available. Our spatially widespread surveys that generate independent metrics of benthic cover and coral abundance collectively provide the most comprehensive description of coral communities at Kingman Reef produced to date and also provide an important record by which to monitor the response of this community to changing ocean conditions.\" </Abstract>  <Date-Time-Last-Modified>20110223000000 </Date-Time-Last-Modified>  <URL>http://www.sil.si.edu/digitalcollections/atollresearchbulletin/issues/00584.pdf </URL>  <Region>PRIA </Region>  <Bounding>  <Eastbc>-159.385349 </Eastbc>  <Westbc>163.070637 </Westbc>  <Southbc>-0.980462 </Southbc>  <Northbc>19.40 </Northbc>  </Bounding>  <CoRIS-Record-Type>article </CoRIS-Record-Type>  <Local-subject-index>article </Local-subject-index>  <Local-subject-index>publication </Local-subject-index>  <resdesc>CoRIS Bibliographic </resdesc> </CoRIS>",
