One important characteristic is&#13; the actual occupancy of a putative binding site in&#13; the genome. In this study, we propose an analytical&#13; model to predict genomic occupancy that incorporates&#13; the preferred target sequence of a TF in the&#13; form of a position weight matrix (PWM), DNA accessibility&#13; data (in the case of eukaryotes), the number&#13; of TF molecules expected to be bound specifi-&#13; cally to the DNA and a parameter that modulates the&#13; specificity of the TF. Given actual occupancy data in&#13; the form of ChIP-seq profiles, we backwards inferred&#13; copy number and specificity for five Drosophila TFs&#13; during early embryonic development: Bicoid, Caudal,&#13; Giant, Hunchback and Kruppel. Our results suggest&#13; that these TFs display thousands of molecules that&#13; are specifically bound to the DNA and that whilst&#13; Bicoid and Caudal display a higher specificity, the&#13; other three TFs (Giant, Hunchback and Kruppel) display&#13; lower specificity in their binding (despite having&#13; PWMs with higher information content). This study&#13; gives further weight to earlier investigations into TF&#13; copy numbers that suggest a significant proportion&#13; of molecules are not bound specifically to the DNA.

As an increasing number of examples was characterised, a common mechanism began to emerge. Non-coding RNAs, such as CopA and Sok from plasmid R1, or RNAI from ColE1, exerted regulation by refolding the secondary structures of their target RNAs or modifying their translation. One regulatory RNA that seemed to swim against the tide was Rcd, encoded within the multimer resolution site of ColE1. Required for high fidelity maintenance of the plasmid in recombination-proficient hosts, Rcd was found to have a protein target, elevating indole production by stimulating tryptophanase. Rcd production is upregulated in dimer-containing cells and the consequent increase in indole is part of the response to the rapid accumulation of dimers by over-replication (known as the dimer catastrophe). It is proposed that indole simultaneously inhibits cell division and plasmid replication, stopping the catastrophe and allowing time for the resolution of dimers to monomers. The idea of a plasmid-mediated cell division checkpoint, proposed but then discarded in the 1980s, appears to be enjoying a revival.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with insulin resistance and obesity, as well as progressive liver dysfunction. Recent animal studies have underscored the importance of hepatic growth hormone (GH) signaling in the development of NAFLD. The imprinted Delta-like homolog 1 (Dlk1)/preadipocyte factor 1 (Pref1) gene encodes a complex protein producing both circulating and membrane-tethered isoforms whose expression dosage is functionally important because even modest elevation during embryogenesis causes lethality. DLK1 is up-regulated during embryogenesis, during suckling, and in the mother during pregnancy. We investigated the normal role for elevated DLK1 dosage by overexpressing Dlk1 from endogenous control elements. This increased DLK1 dosage caused improved glucose tolerance with no primary defect in adipose tissue expansion even under extreme metabolic stress. Rather, Dlk1 overexpression caused reduced fat stores, pituitary insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) resistance, and a defect in feedback regulation of GH. Increased circulatory GH culminated in a switch in whole body fuel metabolism and a reduction in hepatic steatosis. We propose that the function of DLK1 is to shift the metabolic mode of the organism toward peripheral lipid oxidation and away from lipid storage, thus mediating important physiological adaptations associated with early life and with implications for metabolic disease resistance.

Every cell has a characteristic shape key to its fate and function. That shape is not only the product of genetic design and of the physical and biochemical environment, but it is also subject to inheritance. However, the nature and contribution of cell shape inheritance to morphogenetic control is mostly ignored. Here, we investigate morphogenetic inheritance in the cylindrically-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Focusing on sixteen different \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcurved\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd mutants - a class of mutants which often fail to grow axially straight \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd we quantitatively characterize their dynamics of cell shape inheritance throughout generations. We show that mutants of similar machineries display similar dynamics of cell shape inheritance, and exploit this feature to show that persistent axial cell growth in S. pombe is secured by multiple, separable molecular pathways. Finally, we find that one of those pathways corresponds to the swc2-swr1-vps71 SWR1/SRCAP chromatin remodelling complex, which acts additively to the known mal3-tip1-mto1-mto2 microtubule and tea1-tea2-tea4-pom1 polarity machineries.
