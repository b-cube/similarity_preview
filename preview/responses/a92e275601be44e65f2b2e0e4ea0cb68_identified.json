Four controllable design parameters affecting the perfusion process were identified in a cause\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeffect diagram as potential improvement opportunities. A screening process was used to separate out the factors that have the largest impact from the insignificant ones. DOE was employed to find the settings of the platen design, return tubing configuration and the elevation difference that minimise the load on the pump and variation in the perfusion process and improve the controllability of the perfusion pressures within the prescribed limits. DOE was very effective for gaining increased knowledge of the perfusion process and optimizing the process for improved functionality. It is hypothesized that the optimized perfusion system will result in improved biological performance and consistency.

Abstract: This paper presents a literature review of the cell formation (CF) problem concentrating on formulations&#xD; proposed in the last decade. It refers to a number of solution approaches that have been employed for CF&#xD; such as mathematical programming, heuristic and metaheuristic methodologies and artificial intelligence&#xD; strategies. A comparison and evaluation of all methodologies is attempted and some shortcomings are&#xD; highlighted. Finally, suggestions for future research are proposed useful for CF researchers.

Abstract: Cell formation has received much attention from academicians and practitioners&#xD; because of its strategic importance to modern manufacturing practices. Existing research on&#xD; cell formation problems using integer programming (IP) has achieved the target of solving&#xD; problems that simultaneously optimise: (a) cell formation, (b) machine-cell allocation, and&#xD; (c) part-machine allocation.&#xD; This paper will present extensions of the IP model where part-machine assignment and&#xD; cell formation are addressed simultaneously, and also a significant number of constraints&#xD; together with an enhanced objective function are considered. The main study examines the&#xD; integration of inter-cell movements of parts and machine set-up costs within the objective&#xD; function, and also the combination of machine set-up costs associated with parts revisiting&#xD; a cell when part machine operation sequence is taken into account. The latter feature incorporates&#xD; a key set of constraints which identify the number of times a part travels back to a&#xD; cell for a later machine operation.&#xD; Due to two main drawbacks of IP modelling for cell formation, i.e. (a) only one objective&#xD; function can be involved and (b) the decision maker is required to specify precisely goals&#xD; and constraints, fuzzy elements like fuzzy constraints and fuzzy goals will be considered in&#xD; the proposed model.&#xD; Overall the paper will not only include an extended and enhanced integer programming&#xD; model for assessing the performance of cell formation, but also perform a rigorous study&#xD; of fuzzy integer programming and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving better and faster&#xD; clustering results using fuzzy theory.

Abstract: This paper presents extensions of the IP model where part-machine assignment and cell formation are addressed simultaneously and part machine utilisation is considered. More specifically, an integration of inter-cell movements of parts and machine set-up costs within the objective function, and also a combination of machine set-up costs associated with parts revisiting a cell when the part machine operation sequence is taken into account are examined and an enhanced model is formulated. Based upon this model's requirements, an initial three stage approach is proposed and a tabu search iterative procedure is designed to produce a solution. The initial approach consists of the allocation of machines to cells, the allocation of parts to machines in cells and the evaluation of the objective function's value. Special care has been taken when allocating parts to machine cells as part machine operation sequence is preserved making the system more complex but more realistic. The proposed tabu search algorithm integrates short term memory and an overall iterative searching strategy where two move types, single and exchange, are considered. Computational experiments verified both the algorithm's robustness where promising solutions in reasonably short computational effort are produced and also the algorithm's effectiveness for large scale data sets.
