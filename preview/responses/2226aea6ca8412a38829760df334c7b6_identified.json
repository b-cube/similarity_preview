After a delay of at least thirty years, reparation legislation was enacted in 2007 with the passage of the Historical Memory Law, which is regarded as one of Spain\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds most ambitious measures to address its past human rights violations. This thesis argues that three main factors encouraged the Law\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds passage. First, Spanish involvement in foreign social justice shined a spotlight on Spain\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds own unsettled past. Second, the maturation of a younger generation that did not experience the worst years of the dictatorship turned public opinion in favor of reparation. Finally, the Law was introduced under opportune political circumstances and encompassed minimal reparations in order to receive the necessary congressional vote.</dc:description><dc:language>English</dc:language></oai_dc:dc>",
