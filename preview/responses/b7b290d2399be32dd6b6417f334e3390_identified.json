This investigation involved several branches of the Athenian government: the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>. This procedure, an innovation of the <dateRange from=\"-345\" to=\"-323\">later 4th century BCE</dateRange>, began with an investigation conducted by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, which would issue a report. The report was called an <term>apophasis</term> (<foreign lang='grc'>a)po/fasis</foreign>). Eventually, the whole procedure&#8212;investigation, report, prosecution&#8212;came to be known by this term. When the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> issued its report on suspected treason or bribery, it included a recommendation, either to prosecute certain parties or not to. If the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> recommended prosecution, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> would appoint prosecutors, and the matter would be tried before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>. The different institutions seem to have served to balance each other, and we hear of several cases in which the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> recommended conviction, but the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> or <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref> acquitted the defendant.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Introduction\" n=\"Introduction\"> <head>Introduction</head>  <p><term>Apophasis</term> (<foreign lang='grc'>a)po/fasis</foreign>) refers to a report issued by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> after the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> had investigated a matter of bribery or treason (see, for example, <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.1\">Din. 1.1</bibl>). But this report was merely one part of an involved process of investigation and prosecution that involved the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>. The best evidence for this procedure comes from <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name>&#8217; speech prosecuting <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> for allegedly having taken bribes from <name type=\"person\">Harpalus</name>, a Macedonian (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.1\">Din. 1.1</bibl>). In this speech, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> concisely describes the procedure for an <term>apophasis</term>, and describes how the different institutions of the Athenian government worked together. He begins by saying that, <quote>The council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> is bound, gentlemen, to follow one of two methods in making all its reports (<foreign lang='grc'>ta\\\\s a)pofa/seis pa/sas</foreign>)</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.50\">Din. 1.50</bibl>). He spends a couple of sentences criticizing <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, then returns to characterize the current procedings: <quote>Compare the present case, where you have both a decree <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\"><foreign lang='grc'>yh/fisma</foreign>, passed by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref></note> which authorized the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopgagus\">council</xref>&#8217;s inquiry <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">the <soCalled><xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">council</xref></soCalled> here is the Council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref></note>, and accusers, elected by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref> <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\"><foreign lang='grc'>xeirotonh/santos tou= dh/mou</foreign>, referring again to a vote by show of hands in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref></note>, who are now giving the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\"><foreign lang='grc'>oi( dikastai\\\\</foreign>, in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref></note> an account of the crimes</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.51\">Din. 1.51</bibl>).</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"FirstAppears\" n=\"FirstAppearance\"> <head>Aphophasis First Appears in the later 4th century</head>  <p>In a speech delivered in <date value=\"-323\">323 BCE</date>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> refers to a decree, moved in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, that that <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> should investigate a matter of bribery <quote>as was its traditional right</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">w(s au)th=| pa/trio/n e)sti</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.4\">Din. 1.4</bibl>; source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\">Hansen, 292</bibl>). But we do not have much other evidence that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> regularly investigated matters of bribery. When <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aristotle</name> describes the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus&#8217;</xref> duties in the <dateRange from=\"-399\" to=\"-300\">4th century</dateRange>, he says that, <quote>Trials for deliberate murder and wounding are held in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, and for causing death by poison, and for arson</quote> (<bibl author=\"Aristotle\" work=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol.\" n=\"Aristot. Ath. Pol. 57.3\">Aristot. <title>Ath. Pol.</title> 57.3</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 23\" n=\"Dem. 23.22\">Dem. 23.22</bibl>).</p>  <p>There is however some evidence for the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> issuing reports to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> apart from the procedure we call <term>apophasis</term>. Sometime before <date value=\"-343\">343 BCE</date>, we hear of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> reporting to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> on the matter of some dwellings on the <name type=\"site\" n=\"Pnyx, Athens\">Pnyx</name> (<bibl author=\"Aeschines\" work=\"Aeschin. 1\" n=\"Aeschin. 1.81\">Aeschin. 1.81</bibl>; source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\">Harris, <title>Aeschines and Athenian Politics</title></bibl>).</p>  <p>But this is not called an <term>apophasis</term>, and does not seem to have been similar to the later procedure. In fact, none of the evidence from <name type=\"ancientGenre\">oratory</name> before the <dateRange from=\"-350\" to=\"-300\">second half of the 4th century</dateRange> mention <term>apophasis</term> (this includes the orators <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Andocides</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Isaeus</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Antiphon</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Lysias</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Isocrates</name>, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Lycurgus</name>, and <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> uses the term several times, (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.60\">Dem. 18.60</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 37\" n=\"Dem. 37.21\">Dem. 37.21</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 37\" n=\"Dem. 37.34\">Dem. 37.34</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.1\">Dem. 41.1</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.2\">Dem. 41.2</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.11\">Dem. 41.11</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.12\">Dem. 41.12</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.14\">Dem. 41.14</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.17\">Dem. 41.17</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.25\">Dem. 41.25</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.26\">Dem. 41.26</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.27\">Dem. 41.27</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.28\">Dem. 41.28</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 41\" n=\"Dem. 41.30\">Dem. 41.30</bibl>, <bibl author=\"Apollodorus\" work=\"Dem. 47\" n=\"Dem. 47.45\">Dem. 47.45</bibl>), but in each case he seems to use the word generically, <soCalled>an account</soCalled>, such as someone might give when returning from a voyage, or (often) when itemizing an estate so the inheritance can be settled.</p>  <p>In <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> speech <soCalled>On the Crown,</soCalled> delivered in <date value=\"-330\">330 BCE</date> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18\">Dem. 18</bibl>; source for date: <bibl primary=\"NO\"><title>OCD</title><edition>3</edition></bibl>), he mentions two events that might be the first instances of <term>apophasis</term>, although he does not use the term. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> mentions a man named <name type=\"person\">Antiphon</name> (not the orator <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Antiphon</name>) who had been exiled from <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>, and then apprehended at the port of the <placeName key=\"Piraeus\">Piraeus</placeName>; he was acquitted, either by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref> or by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, but the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> investigated the matter and secured his conviction (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.133\">Dem. 18.133</bibl>). Then, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> describes how <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Aeschines</name>, having been selected to be an ambassador by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>, was investigated by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, which <quote>rejected him as a traitor</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">a)ph/lasen w(s prodo/thn</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.134\">Dem. 18.134</bibl>). There is some reason to think that these might be the first attested instances of the procedure we call <term>apophasis</term>. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name>, in a speech seven years later, mentions the case of <name type=\"person\">Antiphon</name> and says that he was tortured and killed as a result of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>&#8217; <term>apophasis</term> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e)stre/blwsan *)antifw=nta kai\\\\ a)pe/kteinan ou(=toi th=| th=s boulh=s a)pofa/sei peisqe/ntes</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.63\">Din. 1.63</bibl>). He then says that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> himself had been instrumental in giving this authority to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, citing the cases not only of <name type=\"person\">Antiphon</name>, but also of a descendant of the hero <name type=\"person\">Aristogiton</name>, and a man named <name type=\"person\">Charinus</name> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.63\">Din. 1.63</bibl>). So we can conclude that the procedure probably came into existence before <date value=\"-330\">330</date>, and came to be referred to as <term>apophasis</term> before <date value=\"323 BCE\">323 BCE</date> (source for dates: <bibl primary=\"NO\">Hansen, 292</bibl>).</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Treason\" n=\"Treason\"> <head><term>Apophasis</term> invoked for cases of treason, bribery, and attempts to overthrow the democracy, but also for lesser crimes</head>  <p>In <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name>&#8217; speech against <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, part of an <term>apophasis</term>, the orator&#8217;s rhetoric suggests that the trial was about more than bribery (the actual accusation; see <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.1\">Din. 1.1</bibl>), but was about the security of the Athenian democracy. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> says that anyone who would defend <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> is an enemy of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>: <quote>And whenever anyone comes forward to speak for him, bear in mind that he who does so, even if not involved in the reports [<foreign lang='grc'>a)pofa/sesin</foreign>] we are about to hear, is hostile to the constitution, unwilling to see punished those who take bribes against the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref> and anxious that the general protection of your persons, for which the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> is responsible, should be abolished and every right in the city overwhelmed</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.112\">Din. 1.112</bibl>). According to <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> investigated the question of bribery because any case of Macedonians bribing prominent Athenians would put the city in danger (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.3-4\">Din. 1.3-4</bibl>).</p>  <p><term>Apophasis</term> was also used in cases when the city itself was thought to be in danger from some external enemy. <name type=\"person\">Antiphon</name> was the subject of <term>apophasis</term> because, after being exiled as a spy and saboteur for the Macedonians, he was caught back in <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.132\">Dem. 18.132</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.63\">Din. 1.63</bibl>). A man named <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> of <name type=\"deme\" n=\"Cydantidae\">Cydantidae</name> was the subject of an <term>apophasis</term> because he had made suspicious trips to <placeName key=\"Megara\">Megara</placeName> (although he was cleared of all suspicion when it was discovered that he had relatives there) (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.58\">Din. 1.58</bibl>). And <name type=\"person\">Charinus</name> was exiled, after an <term>apophasis</term>, on a charge of treason (<foreign lang=\"grc\">e)pi\\\\ prodosi/a|</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.63\">Din. 1.63</bibl>).</p>  <p>In a brief passage, however, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> mentions some lesser offenses that were first brought before the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> and then referred to a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref>&#8212;a defendant who robbed the captain of a ferry-boat, someone fraudulently collecting five drachmas (a public subsidy for attending the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Theater of Dionysus, Athens\">theater</xref>), and a member of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> who was given a portion of meat from a public sacrifice (a benefit of service on the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>) who sold the portion illegally (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.56\">Din. 1.56</bibl>). </p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Procedure\" n=\"Procedure\"> <head>The Procedure</head>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> says that either the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> or the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> could initiate an <term>apophasis</term>: <quote>The council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> is bound, gentlemen, to follow one of two methods in making all its reports (<foreign lang='grc'>ta\\\\s a)pofa/seis</foreign>). What are these methods? Its inquiry is made either on its own initiative or in obedience to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref>&#8217;s instructions</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.50\">Din. 1.50</bibl>). In at least one case, that of <name type=\"person\">Antiphon</name>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> initiated an <term>apophasis</term> after the man had been acquitted by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref> (<bibl author=\"Demosthenes\" work=\"Dem. 18\" n=\"Dem. 18.133\">Dem. 18.133</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.63\">Din. 1.63</bibl>). In the trial of <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> (<foreign lang='grc'>o( dh=mos</foreign>) passed a decree asking the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> to investigate the question of bribery and to issue an <term>apophasis</term> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.4\">Din. 1.4</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.7\">Din. 1.7</bibl>; <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.58\">Din. 1.58</bibl>); because <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.4\">Din. 1.4</bibl> mentions <quote>the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">People</xref> passing a lawful decree</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">yhfisame/nou ga\\\\r tou= dh/mou di/kaion yh/fisma</foreign>), we can be sure that he is speaking of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref>.</p>  <p>Once an <term>apophasis</term> was begun, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> conducted an investigation. In a fragmentary speech by <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Hyperides</name>, from the trial of <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, the orator says, <quote>The reporting of the names of the recipients <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">of bribes</note> it <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\"><term>i.e.</term> the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref></note> assigned to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, who gave these men&#8217;s names to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref></quote> (<bibl author=\"Hyperides\" work=\"Hyp. 5\" n=\"Hyp. 5.f9\">Hyp. 5.f9</bibl>; the text of this speech is badly damaged, and some parts have had to be reconstructed through inference, comparison with other sources, and educated guessing). <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> says that <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name> himself had moved in the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> investigate the question of bribery: <quote>When, moreover, you, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, and many others had proposed in a decree that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, according to its traditional right, should hold an inquiry to discover if any of them had received gold from <name type=\"person\">Harpalus</name>, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> began its investigation (<foreign lang='grc'>zhtei=</foreign>)</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.4\">Din. 1.4</bibl>). Any subsequent action would then depend on the outcome of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>&#8217; report (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.1\">Din. 1.1</bibl>).</p>  <p>After the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> issued its report, the <term>apophasis</term> itself, it could recommend that the defendant be tried before a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref>. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> describes the sequence of events: <quote>In the case of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> of <name type=\"deme\" n=\"Cydantidae\">Cydantidae</name>, when the people instructed the Council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> to inquire whether he was accompanying the exiles to <placeName key=\"Megara\">Megara</placeName> and to report back after the investigation, it reported that he was doing so. You chose accusers as the law prescribes: <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> came into court and you acquitted him, on his admitting that he was going to <placeName key=\"Megara\">Megara</placeName> to <name type=\"person\">Nicophanes</name> who, he said, was married to his mother</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.58\">Din. 1.58</bibl>). Here, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> reported that the man had gone to <placeName key=\"Megara\">Megara</placeName> with some exiles, and was thus suspected of treason. Because of this report, accusers were chosen to prosecute the case before a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">court</xref>.</p>  <p>It seems that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> had to vote on whether to take a case to <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">court</xref> as a result of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>&#8217; <term>apophasis</term>. In a speech prosecuting <name type=\"person\">Aristogiton</name>, in a trial resulting from an <term>apophasis</term> (see <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 2\" n=\"Din. 2.1\">Din. 2.1</bibl>), <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> says of the defendant that <quote>he has been found by the Council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> to have taken bribes against your interests&#8230; and the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">People</xref> have, by a show of hands, handed him over to you <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref></note> to be punished</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">o(/ti tou/tou kate/gnwken h( boulh\\\\ dw=ra lamba/nein kaq' u(mw=n</foreign>&#8230;<foreign lang=\"grc\"> tou/tou kataxeirotonh/sas o( dh=mos parade/dwken u(mi=n timwrh/sasqai</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 2\" n=\"Din. 2.20\">Din. 2.20</bibl>). At the same time that the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> voted on whether to send a defendant to be tried in front of a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref>, it would also elect, by show of hands, one or more prosecuters to present the case against the defendant. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Hyperides</name> mentions chosen accusers (<foreign lang=\"grc\">toi=s h(|rhme/nois kathgo/rois</foreign>) (<bibl author=\"Hyperides\" work=\"Hyp. 5\" n=\"Hyp. 5.f9\">Hyp. 5.f9</bibl>). At <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.58\">Din. 1.58</bibl>, the orator tells the people of <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> that <quote>you chose accusers as the law prescribes</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">kathgo/rous ei(/lesqe kata\\\\ to\\  no/mon</foreign>); and at <bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.51\">Din. 1.51</bibl> he mentions <quote>accusers, elected by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"People\">people</xref>, who are now giving the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> an account of the crimes</quote> (<foreign lang=\"grc\">kai\\\\ kath/goroi xeirotonh/santos tou= dh/mou, par' w(=n nu=n oi( dikastai\\\\ ta)dikh/mata punqa/nontai</foreign>).</p>  <p>It is clear that the ultimate decision&#8212;to punish the defendant or not to&#8212;was in the hands of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref>. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> mentions many cases of defendants who were found guilty by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>&#8217; <term>apophasis</term>, but subsequently acquitted by a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.57-59\">Din. 1.57-59</bibl>). Among them was <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>, whom the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> found to have made suspicious trips to <placeName key=\"Megara\">Megara</placeName> to visit some men who had been exiled from <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName>. But, <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> reminds the jury, <quote><name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> came into <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">court</xref> and you acquitted him, on his admitting that he was going to <placeName key=\"Megara\">Megara</placeName> to <name type=\"person\">Nicophanes</name> who, he said, was married to his mother. So you did not consider that he was doing anything strange or reprehensible in keeping in touch with his mother&#8217;s husband who was in difficulties, or in assisting him, so far as he could, while he was banished from the country</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.58\">Din. 1.58</bibl>).</p>   </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Advantage\" n=\"Advantages\"> <head>The advantage of a complex system of investigation</head>  <p>The case of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> illustrates the advantage of the complex procedure of investigation that came to be called <term>apophasis</term>. By having the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> investigate the facts of a case, and a <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> decide on punishment, the Athenians considered themselves to have struck a balance between impersonal judgement and a more personal justice. <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name> says this explicitly. In his speech against <name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Demosthenes</name>, he explains why, in other cases, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> overrode the findings of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>: <quote>There is an explanation for this which you will easily follow. The council of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, gentlemen, has its own method of inquiring into the cases which you assign to it and the crimes committed within its own body. Unlike yourselves&#8212;and you need not take offence at this&#8212;who are sometimes apt when judging to give more weight to mercy than to justice, it simply reports anyone who is liable to the charges in question or has broken any traditional rule of conduct, believing that if a person is in the habit of committing small offences he will more easily involve himself in serious crimes</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.54-55\">Din. 1.54-55</bibl>). He mentions a few examples of people found guilty by the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>, and then turned over to the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref>: <quote>You tried these men and acquitted them. You were not thereby convicting the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> of error but you were more concerned with sympathy than justice, and thought the punishment too severe for the offence which the defendants had committed</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.56\">Din. 1.56</bibl>). He concludes this explanation with the story of <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.58\">Din. 1.58</bibl>), which he sums up by saying: <quote>The report of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref>&#8230; was not proved false; it was quite true, but the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">jury</xref> decided to acquit <name type=\"person\">Polyeuctus</name>. The council <note place=\"inline\" resp=\"CWB\" rend=\"bracket\">of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref></note> was instructed to discover the truth, yet, as I say, the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">court</xref> decided whether it was a case for pardon</quote> (<bibl author=\"Dinarchus\" work=\"Din. 1\" n=\"Din. 1.59\">Din. 1.59</bibl>).</p>  <p><name type=\"ancientAuthor\">Dinarchus</name>&#8217;s arguments are successful in suggesting that the procedure of <term>apophasis</term>&#8212;which involved the less democratic institution of the <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Areopagus\">Areopagus</xref> and the more democratic <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> and <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"lawcourt\">People&#8217;s Court</xref>&#8212;was flexible and potentially fair.</p>  </div0>  <div0 type=\"Section\" id=\"Bibliography\" n=\"Bibliography\"> <head>Secondary Works Cited</head>  <list rend=\"numbered\">  <item><bibl primary=\"NO\">J.A.
