Given that the work of the programmer is already <ulink url=\"/stidi/fukpi\">adequately protected by copyright</ulink><indexterm id=\"idx004\"><primary>adequately protected by copyright</primary></indexterm>, patents in this area tend to function as tools for expropriating software producers for the benefit of patent producers. Unfortunately for the software producers, legislative competence in patent matters is exclusively owned by the patent producers, i.e. a wide-ranging but yet intimate community of private, corporate and governmental patent professionals. The patent community is governed by a strong consensus which it occasionally codifies in the form of written law. When the patent community finds that a law no longer reflects its consensus, it first circumvents this law and then, at the date of earliest convenience, updates it. Normally this works quite well, because nobody outside the patent community ever cares. However, in the case of software patents, this approach led to internal confusion, <ulink url=\"/analysis/korcu\">diverging court decisions</ulink><indexterm id=\"idx005\"><primary>diverging court decisions</primary></indexterm> and, apparently for the first time ever, <ulink url=\"/log/intro\">serious external resistance</ulink><indexterm id=\"idx006\"><primary>serious external resistance</primary></indexterm>.</para> <para>In July 2005, after several failed attempts to legalise software patents in Europe, the patent establishment changed its strategy.

It is not normal even in the EU to outsource a section of the national judicial system to an international organisation.  Such a measure touches on the foundations of democracy. However, the Lisbon Treaty does nothing to counter-balance the abnormality.  National parliaments would lose their right to pass corrective legislation.  The European Parliament has only blocking rights which apply to the Council but not to the new de facto legislator, the patent community court.
