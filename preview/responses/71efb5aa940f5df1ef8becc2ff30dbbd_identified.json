The composition of the Committee reflects a fair geographical spread across all the sub-regions of the African continent as well as the diverse and trans-disciplinary nature of the stakeholders involved in Future Earth activities. </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The Members are active Scientists who have had experience working with Projects/Programmes/ Initiatives related to one or more of the Future Earth research themes.

The two are planning to work together to initiate research projects to implement science plans of the Regional Office, which are in the areas of Global Environmental Change (including Climate and Adaptation), Health and Human Well-being, Hazards and Disasters, as well as Sustainable Energy. These projects, we hope, will get funding from a large proposal currently in process with a reputable research funder, with the involvement of the ICSU head office.  </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The relationship opens up a new chapter which we hope will contribute positively to the scientific advancement in Africa.

The Office is hosted by the Institute for Urban Environment (IUE) of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). The Urban Health &amp; Wellbeing programme aims to better understand what makes a \"healthy urban environment\", and is co-sponsored by the United Nations University (UNU) and the InterAcademy Medical Panel (IAMP). </description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>During the occasion of the launch, an Expert meeting was held, which brought together leading global researchers working in disciplines related to urban health and well-being to define the strategic and thematic priorities and the medium-and long-term outcomes and activities of the programme. Furthermore, the meeting was to prepare an outlook statement on Urban Health and wellbeing: a Systems Approach. Regional Offices were also invited to this event, a step that opens up avenues for global-regional integration from the outset.</p> <p>ICSU Regional Office for Africa Director presented on the African Regional Thematic Priorities in Urban Health And Well-being, which straddle between the Office's two of the science plans, i.e. Health and Human well-being and Global Environmental Change. The report of the event will be available on the ICSU website as soon as it has been finalized. In the meantime, the Office is inviting expressions of interests from those interested to become \" Programme affiliated research groups\" on a focal thematic area related to the programme.</p> <p>Immediate opportunities and conferences of interest:</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bongani Mahlalela</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2015-01-20T07:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.icsu.org/africa/news-centre/news/scidatacon2014-conference\">     <title>SciDataCon2014 Conference</title>     <link>http://www.icsu.org/africa/news-centre/news/scidatacon2014-conference</link>     <description>The International Conference on Data Sharing and Integration, held every two years, is an important showcase of open science around the world. The 2014 conference was held at the Convention Centre of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, India. The conference, with an overarching theme Data Sharing and Integration for Global Sustainability, was organised in partnership between ICSU\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA), ICSU World Data System (WDS) and the Indian National Science Academy (INSA)</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p style=\"text-align: justify; \">The Director of the Regional Office also attended the conference, contributing mainly towards the segment on Developing Country data issues, which was scheduled to have sessions every day of the conference, ranging from plenary speaker presentations to panel discussions, and which was taking forward issues that were discussed at the prior Nairobi data workshop, held in August 2014. The conference had a mix of very interesting topics, despite being marred by non-attendance of some delegates, owing to unfortunate Visa processes. The programme had three main tracks which ran consistently throughout the four days, namely <strong>Dynamic Planet, Global Development, Transformations towards Sustainability and Data Science and Services. </strong>It remained clear that issues of managing and sharing data globally are still a huge challenge, even more so in developing countries. There is renewed awakening and engagement, but not nearly enough. This points out to a clear need for increased momentum around issues of data. The involvement of young-scientists was particularly commendable since data issues are getting more complex with evolving technologies, and need new generations to continuously keep up with the times.
