Data are derived from California Office of Drinking Water (ODW) Water Quality Monitoring Database (WQMD, also know as Water Quality Inventory or WQI) and Permits, Inspection, Compliance, Monitoring, and Enforcement (PICME) database. The data set contains one record for each Community Water System (CWS) per year with average and maximum concentrations of arsenic and nitrates as well as the frequency of sampling, the number of sampling stations, and the date of the last sample. </abstract> <purpose>This data set contributes to the Environmental Public Health Tracking Network. The EPHT cooperative agreement states that all grantees must track and make available core environmental health tracking measures on the State and National EPHT Network, including data/information on key water contaminants, as defined through the Content workgroup process. The Content Workgroup Water Team identified initial contaminants of concern for the national EPHT program, identified nationally consistent data sources, and developed nationally consistent indicators and measures. This data set can be used to roughly estimate the annual levels of arsenic and nitrate for an entire CWS. Using the Public Water System ID Number, it can be joined with any of the other 3 datasets that accompany this: CWS Inventory, CWS Facility Locations, and Quarterly Indicators. </purpose> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19990101</begdate> <begtime/> <enddate>20081231</enddate> <endtime/> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>Publication Date</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Two times per year</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-124.409721</westbc> <eastbc>-114.131208</eastbc> <northbc>42.009521999999997</northbc> <southbc>32.53416</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>NONE</themekt> <themekey>hazard</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>FIPS 5-2 (State)</placekt> <placekey>California,CA,06</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>none</accconst> <useconst> Summary measures of water contaminants provided in this dataset and that are attributed to an entire water system are not necessarily indicative of the quality of water served to the customer population of that water system. Water quality can change after sampling and there can exist great spatial heterogeneities within a single water system's distribution area. To complicate matters, individual- and population-level behaviors with respect to drinking water consumption can influence how much contact there is with drinking water contaminants. Therefore these data should not be used in linking to health data without great care and attention to potential confounders. </useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>CEHTP Science Team</cntper> <cntorg>CDPH/EHIB</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos/> <cntaddr> <addrtype>Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>850 Marina Bay Parkway, Bldg P, 3rd Floor&#13; &#13; </address> <city>Richmond</city> <state>CA</state> <postal>94804</postal> <country>United States Of America</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>(510)620-3620</cntvoice> <cnttdd/> <cntfax>(510)620-3720</cntfax> <cntemail>data@cehtp.org</cntemail> <hours/> <cntinst/> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <secinfo> <secsys>none</secsys> <secclass>Unclassified</secclass> <sechandl>none</sechandl> </secinfo> <native>Relational Database Management System: SQL Server 2005 </native> </idinfo> <dataqual> <logic>The EPHTN Drinking Water Content Workgroup concluded that analytical results should be gathered from active, community water systems at USEPA-defined compliance sampling points from years 1999 to the most current year of available data. WQMD and PICME are coded logically to successfully ascertain active CWS, however, it is unclear whether the sampling points and subsequent analytical results meet the USEPA definition for \"compliance\" or whether the databases are structured to successfully perform this function with consistent results for every water system captured in the database. The compliance point for arsenic and nitrate is at the entry point to the distribution system. Since there is no WQMD/PICME coding scheme for determining systematically which sample points are entry points in PICME, the following logic was used: all sample sites, locally or from exporting systems one level up, having analytic results for arsenic or nitrate during the period 1999-[most currently available year] at stations coded as Active Treated (AT), Active Untreated (AU, implying no further treatment), Purchased Treated (PT), Purchased Untreated (PU), Combination Treated (CT), and Combination Untreated (CU) were considered compliance sample points and included in the sample results table. Active Raw (AR, implying downstream treatment but not necessarily for arsenic or nitrate), Purchased Raw (PR), and Combination Raw (CR) sample sites were included if the downstream after treatment sample site witnessed no arsenic/nitrate sampling during the reporting period. Using sample sites before treatment in this manner was recommended by ODW staff as it was highly unlikely -- due to no downstream sampling -- that the downstream treatment site was also treating for arsenic or nitrate. For non-detects, 1/2 the detection limit was used for annual measures, except in cases when 1. all sample results during the reporting period resulted in non-detects or 2. the maximum system-wide detected finding during the reporting period was less than half the detection limit. In these cases, a zero was substituted for the measure or 1/2 the maximum system-wide detection during the reporting period was used, respectively. Because of wide variability in arsenic sampling schedules and reduced sampling frequency in systems with low detection values, missing annual means and maximums were calculated from the latest day of sampling of the most proximate prior year that arsenic sampling data was available as per Content Workgroup requirements. In all other cases, including any missing annual nitrate data, the mean, maximum, sample counts, sampling station counts, and date of last sample is coded as missing. </logic> <complete> This dataset is limited by legal monitoring practices and scheduling as defined by the California Water Code and the US Safe Drinking Water Act. The most notable aspect of incompleteness relative to environmental health tracking is that any summary measure of water contamination that is attributed to an entire water system is not necessarily indicative of the quality of water served to the customer population of that water system. Water quality can change after sampling and there is often great heterogeneity within a single water system's distribution area. Sampling results related to Disinfection By-Products within distribution systems according to the Surface Water Treatment Rule and as a required indicator in this dataset are missing, because regional districts and labs for the most part are not currently reporting distribution system sampling information to PICME and WQMD. In previous drinking water submissions, DBP data was included for those systems where data was available, because only statewide indicators were provided. DBP data are not included in this submission, because of increased spatial and temporal resolution in the measures. </complete> <lineage> <procstep> <procdesc>CEHTP received comma-separated (CSV) PICME database from ODW (11/23/2009) and imported SOUPATH (N=19464, minus 2 non-CWS systems with referential integrity errors), SOURCE (N=43431 minus 8 non-CWS sources with referential integrity errors), and SYSNUM1 (N=14062) tables into SQL Server 2005.</procdesc> <procdate>20091125</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>CEHTP received WQMD tables CHEMICAL (dated 11/3/2009, N=5186841), CHEMARCH (11/2/2009, N=8634511), CHEMHIST (11/2/2009, N=7410660) in dbf format from ODW on 11/25/2009.
