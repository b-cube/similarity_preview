Surviving members of this birth cohort have been surveyed on eight further occasions in order to monitor their changing health, education, social and economic circumstances - in 1965 at age 7, 1969 at age 11, 1974 at age 16 (the first three sweeps are also held under SN 5565), 1981 (age 23 - SN 5566), 1991 (age 33 - SN 5567), 1999/2000 (age 41/2 - SN 5578), 2004-2005 (age 46/47 - SN 5579), 2008-2009 (age 50 - SN 6137) and 2013 (age 55 - SN 7669).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; There have also been surveys of sub-samples of the cohort, the most recent occurring in 1995 (age 37), when a 10% representative sub-sample was assessed for difficulties with basic skills (SN 4992). Finally, during 2002-2004, 9,340 NCDS cohort members participated in a bio-medical survey, carried out by qualified nurses (SN 5594, available under more restrictive Special Licence access conditions; see catalogue record for details). The bio-medical survey did not cover any of the topics included in the 2004/2005 survey. Further NCDS data separate to the main surveys include a response and deaths dataset, parent migration studies, employment, activity and partnership histories, behavioural studies and essays - see the &lt;a href=\"http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/series/?sn=2000032\" title=\"NCDS series page\"&gt;NCDS series page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Further information about the NCDS can be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk\" title=\"Centre for Longitudinal Studies\"&gt;Centre for Longitudinal Studies&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>The purpose of the &lt;i&gt;National Child Development Study: Activity Histories, 1974-2008&lt;/i&gt; was to merge all data on work and non-work activities in successive sweeps into one longitudinal dataset. Data on work and non-work activities lasting one month or more have been collected in all National Child Development Study (NCDS) sweeps from sweep  4 (age 23) onwards.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The focus of the questions asked at each sweep vary from: work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep  4 aged 23); work and non-work activities engaged in since leaving school (sweep 5, aged 33); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep (sweep 6, aged 42); work and non-work activities engaged in since the last sweep or aged 16 (sweep 7, aged 46) work and non-work activities engaged in since 2000, or 2004 if included in sweep 7 (sweep 8, aged 50). Therefore the activity histories will start from the time that the cohort member left school and continue until the interview date of the latest data sweep that each cohort member participated in.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The lengths of the activity histories vary depending on the latest sweep that a cohort member was present at. The minimum activity history length recorded is 1 month and the maximum is 419 months (approximately 35 years). Gaps in the activity histories occur where a cohort member has not been present at all sweeps and/or where full activity data were not reported. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; An employment histories dataset was previously created (Ward, 2007) (available from the UK Data Archive under SN 5600). This work was undertaken as part of the Gender Network Project. The current work on NCDS activity histories builds on this previous activity history and incorporates various cleaning of the data. This previous employment history included data up to sweep 7 (2004) only, did not deal with any non-work activities and did not identify duplicate activities (i.e. where an activity was reported again in a later sweep).&lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>&lt;B&gt;Main Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The NCDS Activity Histories dataset contains one record for each work or non-work activity.</abstract>       <sumDscr>         <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1974-01-01T00:00:00Z\">1974</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z\">2008</collDate>         <nation>Great Britain</nation>         <geogUnit>No spatial unit</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit>         <universe>National</universe>         <universe>Adults in Great Britain born in one particular week in March 1958.</universe>         <dataKind>Numeric data</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <timeMeth>Longitudinal/panel/cohort</timeMeth>         <sampProc>No sampling (total universe)</sampProc>         <deviat>111,816 records for 18,558 cohort members.</deviat>         <collMode>Compilation or synthesis of existing material</collMode>         <sources />         <weight>No weighting used.</weight>         <cleanOps>A*</cleanOps>       </dataColl>     </method>     <dataAccs>       <setAvail>         <accsPlac>UK Data Service</accsPlac>       </setAvail>       <useStmt>         <specPerm>Special conditions of access</specPerm>         <restrctn>The depositor has specified that registration is required and standard conditions of use apply.
