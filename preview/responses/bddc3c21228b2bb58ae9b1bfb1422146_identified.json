Once established, variable leaf water-milfoil forms dense beds that can alter the limnologic characteristics of a waterbody, impacting natural lacustrine communities and their habitats.  Variable leaf water-milfoil infestations also disrupt recreational uses of waterbodies and have negatively affected swimming, boating, fishing, and property values in and around several lakes and ponds in New Hampshire.  In 1965, Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee became the first waterbody in New Hampshire where variable leaf water-milfoil was observed. Variable leaf water-milfoil is native to the Southeastern and Midwestern areas of the United States where more alkaline waters appear to limit the growth of this plant. Outside its native range, however, it adapts well to the relatively acidic, low-alkalinity, and nutrient-poor conditions of oligotrophic lakes and bays similar to Moultonborough Bay.  In 2005, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) collaborated with the U.S. Geological Survey to investigate the distribution (presence and density) of variable leaf water-milfoil in Moultonborough Bay. This study utilized geophysical systems and conventional water-quality measurements to identify lake-floor environments that may provide suitable habitat for the establishment and growth of variable leaf water-milfoil. The results of the study are intended to assist resource managers in federal and state agencies by providing methods for detecting variable leaf water-milfoil and for identifying areas susceptible to infestation. Ultimately, this information may lead to early detection, prevention, and more effective mitigation strategies. </abstract> <purpose>This data set includes the bottom photographs (JPEG images) collected within Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire during USGS field activity 2005-004-FA.

Offsets between the DGPS antenna and the mini-SEABOSS were not measured. The horizontal position of the mini-SEABOSS during sample collection is assumed to be +/- 10 meters at best, due to a lack of precise positional data at the time of sample recovery.</horizpar> </horizpa> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>U.S. Geological Survey</origin> <pubdate>Unpublished Material</pubdate> <title>Sediment Textural Data</title> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>online</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>20050727</begdate> <enddate>20050728</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <srccurr>ground condition of field activity</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>none</srccitea> <srccontr> The Mini SEABOSS was designed specifically for the USGS Woods Hole Science Center&apos;s 26-foot research vessel Rafael. This system is equipped with two video cameras, a digital still camera, and a Van Veen grab sampler. This system, weighing approximately 200 lbs., can be used to depths up to 40 meters. The grab itself is raised and lowered with a 3/16-inch Aramid fiber winch-line with a breaking strength of 5,600 pounds. The davit is secured when the Mini SEABOSS is in the water. The electrical cable is on a spring-wound take-up reel with electrical slip rings that is mounted aft of the sampler. This arrangement protects the 0.38-in. multi-conductor cable and keeps the Mini SEABOSS correctly oriented with the boat. This multi-conductor cable enables communication between the ship&apos;s lab and the Mini SEABOSS system. The digital camera, a Minolta Dimage 7Hi, is mounted in a machined Delrin housing with a flat port and is set for 2560 x 1920 pixel images at the &quot;fine&quot; setting for compression. This allows the camera to be used for over 200 images with a 1 GB Compact Flash card without downloading. The system also has a 50 Watt/second flash unit powered by 8 AA batteries. Two battery-powered lasers are set 15 cm apart for scale measurements. The red laser dots can usually be seen in the photo depending on the bottom type and the distance to the sea floor. A third battery powered laser is positioned at an angle so that when it intersects the other lasers, the Mini SEABOSS is at the optimum height off the bottom for a still photograph (optimal height is generally 75 cm above the bottom). The camera is set to a manual focus and set to a default focus distance (50 cm) once the camera is powered up. The default focus distance is slightly less than the optimum height above the seafloor to account for optical distortion under water.  Video images were collected at 40 sample locations and digital photographs were collected at 35 sample locations using the USGS Mini SEABOSS (Blackwood and Parolski, 2001). Mini SEABOSS stations were selected based on preliminary acoustic-backscatter mosaics, with the objective of characterizing broad areas of different backscatter intensity. With the Mini SEABOSS deployed, the research vessel was allowed to drift with occasional power from the vessel to control drift direction. Continuous video was collected over a total of 696 meters of lakefloor. Video drift position was derived from the HYPACK navigation files based on the start and end times of the drift. For some portions of the drift, there was no navigation, so the position was derived from the time and position stamp in the video at 30-s intervals. Latitude and Longitude for sample locations 1 and 8 were derived solely from the video as HYPACK was not recording. </srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> Bottom photographs were collected with the mini SEABOSS (Blackwood and Parolski, 2001) at 35 sample stations in Moultonborough Bay, Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire, 2005.

The attributes chosen for export were: LONG, LAT, YEAR, PICNAME, GPSTIME. The text editor VI v 7.3 was used to edit the year to include the calendar day in the format YYYYMMDD appropriate for the particular image. A PYTHON script (jane_write_exif.py) was then run that incorporated this information, along with additional information, into the appropriate locations in the EXIF header of each JPEG images. The PYTHON script uses exiftool (version 8.4.7.0) to write the information to the image headers.  The following tags were populated in the JPEG image headers. Information is duplicated in some tags. This was done because different software packages access different tags.
