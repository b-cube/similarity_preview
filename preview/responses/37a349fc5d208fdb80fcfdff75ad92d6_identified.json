Richard The work in the Neurophysiology Laboratory is focused on mechanisms underlying motor coordination in mammalian systems. These mechanisms are to be found in the structure and dynamic properties of the musculoskeletal system as well as in the organization of neuronal circuits in the central nervous system. Our work concerns the interactions between the musculoskeletal system and spinal cord that give rise to normal and abnormal movement and posture, and in the manner in which central pattern-generating networks are modified for specific motor tasks. Their studies have applications in several movement disorders, including spinal cord injury. The experimental approaches span a number of levels, from mechanical studies of isolated muscle cells to kinematic measurements of natural behavior in quadrupeds. T.

On a molecular level, records are detailed and extensive, connecting us to the pre-history of biology (the origin of life). The most ancient macromolecules in biology are found in the ribosome, which is the RNA-protein complex responsible for the synthesis of all coded protein in living organisms. The catalytic core of the ribosome a deeply-frozen molecular fossil that is older than modern biology. The origins and early development of the ribosome, billions of years ago, remain firmly imprinted in the biochemistry of extant life. The ribosome tells us part of the story of the origin of life. The information contained within the ribosome guides our laboratory in experimentally recapitulating critical chemical and biochemical steps in the origin and early evolution of life. Loren Williams is the Director, NASA-NAI RiboEvo Center and a Professor in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.  In 1981 he received his B.Sc. in Chemistry from the University of Washington where he worked in the laboratory of Martin Gouterman. In 1985 he received his Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from Duke University, where he worked the laboratory of Barbara Shaw. He was an American Cancer Society Postdoctoral Fellow first at Duke then at Harvard. From 1988 to 1992 he was an NIH Postdoctoral Fellow with Alex Rich in the Department of Biology at MIT. He joined the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech in 1992 where is he currently a professor.
