It runs from 11/9/2008 until 31/12/2013, and contains air temperature, soil temperature at two depths (5cm and 20cm) as well as soil moisture. Climoor is a climate change experiment which investigates the possible impact of increased temperatures and repeated summer drought on an Atlantic upland moorland. The experiment uses automatic roof technology to warm experimental plots by 0.5 - 1 degC and reproduces drought conditions in other experimental plots (July to September annually). In 2014, the Climoor experiment was the second longest running climate change experiment in the UK and data from the experiment has been used in several modelling exercises. The site was originally established under a EU consortium project - called CLIMOOR - where replica manipulation experiments were built in six European countries. As well as our site in North-East Wales (United Kingdom), there are identical sites in Denmark, the Netherlands, Sardinia (Italy) and Hungary. There was also a site in Catalonia (Spain). </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Alwyn Sowerby</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>biogeochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hourly</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-03-06T10:14:09Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/01592784-807b-453a-ac52-0478ad616484\">     <title>Daily automated weather station (AWS) data from Climoor fieldsite in Clocaenog Forest</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/01592784-807b-453a-ac52-0478ad616484</link>     <description>This dataset contains daily automated weather station (AWS) data from the Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest, NE Wales.

It consists of three/six-hourly states of the weather for global half-degree land grid points. It was generated as part of the EU FP 6 project \"WATCH\" (WATer and global CHange\") which ran from 2007-2011. The data was generated in 2 tranches with slightly different methodology: 1901-1957 and 1958-2001, but generally the dataset can be considered as continuous.  More details regarding the generation process can be found in the associated WATCH technical report and paper in J. Hydrometeorology.   To understand how the data grid is formed it is necessary to read the attached WFD-land-long-lat-z files either in NetCDF or DAT formats.   The data covers land points only and excludes the Antarctica.   Rainf or rainfall rate is the rainfall rate based on the GPCC bias corrected, undercatch corrected measured in kg/m2/s at 3 hourly resolution averaged over the next 3 hours and at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution. Please note that there is also a WFD Rainf CRU bias corrected dataset, but as the GPCC dataset is the preferred dataset only this rainfall dataset is available from this gateway. These rainfall datasets contain rainfall data only and need to be combined with the respective WFD snowfall datasets to obtain precipitation data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rainf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Rainfall rate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31dd5dd3-85b7-45f3-96a3-6e6023b0ad61\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century SWdown (Surface incident shortwave radiation) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/31dd5dd3-85b7-45f3-96a3-6e6023b0ad61</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.

Snowf or snowfall is the snowfall rate based on the GPCC bias corrected, undercatch corrected measured in kg/m2/s at 3 hourly resolution averaged over the next 3 hours and at 0.5 x 0.5 degrees spatial resolution.   Please note that there is also a WFD Snowf CRU bias corrected dataset, but as the GPCC dataset is the preferred dataset only this snowfall dataset is available from this gateway. These snowfall datasets contain snowfall data only and need to be combined with the respective WFD rainfall datasets to obtain precipitation data.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Atmospheric conditions</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Global</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>World</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>3-hourly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Atmosphere</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>land surface</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>EU-FP6</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH_Project_NEC04264</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Snowf</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Snowfall rate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Land surface modelling</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>meteorology</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-03T14:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385\">     <title>WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) - 20th Century  LWdown (Surface incident longwave radiation) 1901-2001</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e5d00d66-dcf5-4b0e-9346-f6205a336385</link>     <description>The WATCH Forcing data is a twentieth century meteorological forcing dataset for land surface and hydrological models.
