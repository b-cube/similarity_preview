The USGS works in cooperation with local, State, and Federal environmental agencies to collect water-use information. USGS compiles these data to produce water-use information aggregated at the county, state, and national levels. Every five years, data at the county level are compiled into a national water-use data system and state-level data are published in a national circular. Over the history of these circulars, the water-use categories have had some changes.</abstract>    <purpose>The Water Use Program analyzes the source, use, and disposition of water resources at local, state, and national levels while repling to water-use information requests from the public and documenting the trends in water use in the United States. The Water Use Program cooperates with state and local agencies on projects of special interest and  develops water-use data bases and to publish local, state, and national water-use data reports.     </purpose>    <supplinf> The USGS's National Water Use Information Program  compiles and publishes the Nation's water-use data.  Public access to some of these data is provided via the USGS  Water Data for the Nation site. Water use refers to water that  is used for specific purposes. Water-use data is collected by  area type (State, county, watershed or aquifer) and source  such as rivers or groundwater, and category such as public  supply or irrigation. Water-use data has been reported  every five years since 1950, for years ending in \"0\" and \"5\".  The USGS works in cooperation with local, State, and Federal  agencies as well as academic and private organizations to  collect and report total withdrawals.           Annual water-use data are expressed in units of million gallons  per day (abbreviated as Mgal/d) and thousand acre-feet per year.  For the irrigation category, water-use data are the average daily  quantities used over a period of a year and do not represent  actual daily rates. In most parts of the nation, irrigation water  is applied during only a part of each year and at variable rates;  therefore, the actual rate of application is much greater than the  average daily rate. For all other categories, the daily quantity  of water that is withdrawn may be based on daily usage or  more often, monthly usage that is averaged to a daily quantity.           National water-use data are reported by source (surface water  or groundwater, fresh and saline, and total), and category for the United States as a whole. The water-use data presented  here are the current best estimates, and may have been  revised from previous publications.           Data collection varied between the different compilations.  Pre-1995 datasets have more data available than 2000 and later.  A chart is available that provides for a conceptual picture of the  changes in water-use categories between compilations.  The details of a water-use category sometimes changed  between compilations. For example, for 1985-1995, thermoelectric  power withdrawal data was grouped by fuel type, but for 2000-2005,  thermoelectric power data was grouped by the cooling method  (once-through or closed-loop).

All States also provided estimates of public supply deliveries for domestic use.  All States will have estimates of the total population served by public supply. States optionally may have estimated public supply population served by groundwater and surface water.  All States will have estimates of total irrigation. States optionally may have estimated subtotals for crop irrigation and golf-course irrigation.  No consumptive-use data were collected nationally for any of the categories for 2005.  No commercial water-use data were collected nationally for 2005.  No wastewater release data were collected nationally for 2005.  No hydroelectric power instream use data were collected nationally for 2005.  Public-supply deliveries for commercial, industrial, and thermoelectric power were not collected nationally for 2005.      </procdesc>     <procdate>1950-2005</procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spdoinfo>   <direct>point</direct>   <ptvctinf>    <sdtsterm>     <sdtstype>Point</sdtstype>     <ptvctcnt>50</ptvctcnt>    </sdtsterm>   </ptvctinf>  </spdoinfo>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <geograph>     <latres>0.002</latres>     <longres>0.002</longres>     <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>    </geograph>    <geodetic>     <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn>     <ellips>GRS1980</ellips>     <semiaxis>6,378,137</semiaxis>     <denflat>298.257</denflat>    </geodetic>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover>  WATER USE TERMINOLOGY The following terms have been used in one or more of the water-use Circulars.

Water returned to a different watershed than the point of withdrawal (interbasin transfer) is not considered a consumptive use. Also referred to as water consumed.    1960-1995: Consumptive use reported by water-use category   2000-later: Consumptive use not estimated nationally           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdconveyance loss\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater that is lost in transit from a pipe, canal, conduit, or ditch by leakage or evaporation. Leakage from an irrigation ditch, for example, may percolate to a groundwater source and be available for further use.            1955-1995: Conveyance losses reported nationally   2000-later: Conveyance losses not estimated nationally   See also irrigation water use.           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcooling-system type\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdan equipment system that provides water for cooling purposes, such as to condensers at power plants or at factories, subdivided into once-through or recirculation cooling system.

See also saline water.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfuel-electric power\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsee thermoelectric power water use.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhydroelectric power water use\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe use of water in the generation of electricity at plants where the turbine generators are driven by moving water. Hydroelectric water use is most commonly an instream use. Hydroelectric power water use was referred to as water power from 1950-1960.  1950-1960: Water Power   1965-1995: Hydroelectric Power   2000-later: Hydroelectric Power category not estimated nationally           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdindustrial water use\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater used for fabrication, processing, washing, and cooling.  Includes industries such as chemical and allied products, food, mining, paper and allied products, petroleum refining, and steel.  Industrial water use in 1950-1980 water-use circulars also included thermoelectric power water use which was reported as a subtotal, with the current industrial uses called other industrial. In 1985 thermoelectric power became a separate category, and mining and commercial uses were also split out from industrial in 1985 and reported as separate categories. The term industrial water use was used in the 1985-1995 water-use circulars to describe the combined public-supply deliveries to industrial users and self-supplied industrial withdrawals. For 2000 to present, industrial water use refers only to self-supplied industrial withdrawals.

See also water use.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdrural water use\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater used in suburban or farm areas for domestic and livestock needs.  The water generally is self-supplied, and includes domestic use, drinking water for livestock, and other uses such as dairy sanitation, cleaning, and waste disposal.  Term used in 1950 and 1955 water-use circulars, and was subdivided into rural domestic and rural livestock water use in the 1960-1980 circulars. See also animal-specialties water use, domestic water use, livestock water use, and self-supplied water use.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsaline water\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater that contains 1,000 mg/L or more of dissolved solids. See also freshwater.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdself-supplied water use\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater withdrawn from a groundwater or surface-water source by a user rather than being obtained from a public supply.           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsprinkler irrigation system\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdan irrigation system in which water is applied by means of perforated pipes or nozzles operated under pressure so as to form a spray pattern. See also irrigation water use, microirrigation system, and surface irrigation system.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdstandard industrial classification (SIC) codes\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfour-digit codes established by the Office of Management and Budget, published in 1987, and used in the classification of establishments by type of activity in which they are engaged.           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsurface irrigation system\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdirrigation by means of flood, furrow, or gravity. Flood irrigation is the application of irrigation water in which the entire soil surface is covered by ponded water. Furrow is a partial surface-flooding method of irrigation normally used with clean-tilled crops in which water is applied in furrows or rows of sufficient capacity to contain the design irrigation stream. Gravity is an irrigation method in which water is not pumped, but flows in ditches or pipes and is distributed by gravity. See also irrigation water use, microirrigation system, and sprinkler irrigation system.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthermoelectric-power water use\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater used in the process of generating electricity with steam-driven turbine generators. Term used in previous water-use circulars to describe the combined public-supply deliveries to thermoelectric-power plants and self-supplied thermoelectric-power withdrawals. For 2000 and 2005, thermoelectric-power water use refers only to self-supplied thermoelectric-power withdrawals. The category was called fuel-electric power from 1955-1980, and was reported as a subcategory of industrial water use. Thermoelectric power was subdivided into condensor cooling and other uses from 1955-1980, into fuel types of fossil fuel, geothermal, and nuclear from 1985-1995, and into cooling types of once-through and recirculating from 2000 to present. See also cooling system, cooling-system type, public-supply water use, industrial water use, and self-supplied water use.           \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwastewater-treatment return flow\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater returned to the hydrologic system by wastewater-treatment facilities. Wastewater-treatment return flows were referred to as sewage treatment in 1985. Wastewater treatment return flows were last reported in 1995. See also water use.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater power, waterpower\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhydroelectric power water use          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater use\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdIn a restrictive sense, the term refers to water that is withdrawn for a specific purpose, such as for public supply, domestic use, irrigation, thermoelectric-power cooling, or industrial processing.  In previous water-use circulars, water use for the domestic, commercial, industrial, and thermoelectric categories included both self-supplied withdrawals and deliveries from public supply. More broadly, water use pertains to the interaction of humans with and influence on the hydrologic cycle, and includes elements such as water withdrawal, delivery, consumptive use, wastewater release, reclaimed wastewater, return flow, and instream use.  See also offstream use and instream use.          \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater withdrawal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwater removed from the ground or diverted from a surface-water source for use. See also offstream use and self-supplied water.          -------------------------------------------------------------- CHANGES IN WATER-USE CATEGORIES: Water-use terminology has changed in the series of USGS water-use Circulars prepared at 5-year intervals. The category changes over time are illustrated here. In some changes categories were re-named but retained essentially the same definition, while other changes split existing categories or shifted components of a category to another category. See the linked definitions of the categories for other details at http://water.usgs.gov/watuse/WU-Category-Changes.html.          1950 Municipal, Irrigation, Rural*, Self-supplied Industrial, Water Power              1955 Public Supply, Irrigation, Rural*, Other industrial, Fuel-electric power, Water Power, Condensor Cooling, Other           1960 Public Supply, Irrigation, Rural Domestic, Livestock, Other industrial, Fuel-electric power, Water Power, Condensor Cooling, Other           1965-1980 Public Supply, Irrigation, Rural Domestic, Livestock, Other industrial, Fuel-electric power, Hydroelectric Power,  Condensor Cooling, Other           1985 Public Supply, Irrigation, Domestic, Livestock, Commercial, Industrial, Mining, Thermoelectric power, Hydroelectric Power, Sewage Treatment (releases), Fossil Fuel, Geothermal, Nuclear           1990-1995 Public Supply, Irrigation, Domestic, Livestock, Animal Specialties  (incl. fish farming), Commercial (incl. offstream fish hatcheries), Industrial, Mining, Thermoelectric power, Hydroelectric Power, Wastewater Treatment (releases), Fossil Fuel, Geothermal, Nuclear           2000-2010 Public Supply, Irrigation, Domestic, Livestock, Aquaculture (incl. fish farming &amp; hatcheries), Commercial not estimated, Industrial, Mining, Thermoelectric power, Hydroelectric Power not estimated, Wastewater Treatment not estimated           *Rural estimates for 1950 and 1955 were retroactively allocated to Rural Domestic and Livestock in later reports.     </eaover>    <eadetcit>none</eadetcit>   </overview>  </eainfo>  <distinfo>   <distrib>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>     </cntorgp>     <cntpos>Ask USGS - Water Webserver Team</cntpos>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>mailing</addrtype>      <address>445 National Center</address>      <city>Reston</city>      <state>VA</state>      <postal>20192</postal>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>1-888-275-8747 (1-888-ASK-USGS)</cntvoice>     <cntemail>http://water.usgs.gov/user_feedback_form.html</cntemail>    </cntinfo>   </distrib>   <distliab>Although this data set has been used by the U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior, no warranty expressed or implied is made by the U.S. Geological Survey as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
