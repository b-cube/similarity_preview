The apertures were scaled to the shoulder width of the participants and were: 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9 and 2.1 times shoulder width.  Movement was measured using a VICON system and by attaching marking on the left and right acroniom process and on C7. A number of different variables were measured during the approach and passage through the aperture. These included, walking speed, shoulder rotation while passing through the aperture and medio-lateral trunk movement during the approach.  The full methods and the data are described in: (TBA once the paper is published) </abstract>       <sumDscr>         <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2013-03-01T00:00:00Z\">01 March 2013</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2015-10-31T00:00:00Z\">31 October 2015</collDate>         <nation>United Kingdom</nation>         <geogCover>NOC, Oxford</geogCover>         <anlyUnit>events and processes</anlyUnit>         <dataKind>Alpha-numeric</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <collMode>Various kinematic measures were taken while participants walked up to and through various sized apertures.   A VICON system with 12 cameras running at 100Hz captured the movement of markers on the left and right acroniom process and C7. Participants approached each aperture, starting 4m away and passed through, turning the shoulders if necessary. Apertures were scaled to shoulder width:0.9, 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.9 and 2.1 times shoulder width  We measured: Baseline sway of the shoulders during the approach Shoulder angle compared to the frontal plane when the participant was at the aperture Approach speed Reduction in speed (if there was one) Time left after initiation of the reduction in speed Lateral trunk movement during the approach   Participants were 15 adults with Developmental Coordination Disorder and 15 typically developing participants who were age and gender matched. </collMode>         <sources />       </dataColl>     </method>     <dataAccs>       <setAvail>         <accsPlac>UK Data Service</accsPlac>       </setAvail>       <useStmt>         <contact>&lt;a href=\"mailto:k.wilmut@brookes.ac.uk\"&gt;Kate Wilmut, Ox ford Brookes University&lt;/a&gt;</contact>       </useStmt>     </dataAccs>     <othrStdyMat />   </stdyDscr> </codeBook>",
