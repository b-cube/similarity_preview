Respondents were asked to give their opinions of President Bill Clinton and his handling of the situation with Iraq, independent counsel Kenneth Starr, and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. A series of questions focused on United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan's agreement with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to allow inspectors full access to search for weapons of mass destruction. Respondents were asked if they believed that Hussein would honor that promise, whether they believed that economic sanctions should be lifted if Iraq cooperated, whether they supported United States Air Force bombing of Iraq if they did not comply, and whether they believed that United Nations diplomatic efforts or United States military threats were most effective when dealing with Iraq. Those queried were asked for their opinions on New York City as a place to live and visit, crime in that city as compared to other large cities, whether New York City was accurately portrayed on television and in the movies, and for their personal experiences while visiting or residing in New York City. President Clinton's alleged affairs with former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky were also addressed. Respondents were asked whom they believed, whether Clinton encouraged anyone to lie while under oath, who was to blame for creating this situation, and what result the investigations should produce, including resignation, impeachment, admission and the issuance of an apology, or if the entire investigation should be dropped. Additional questions addressed the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. by James Earl Ray. A final series of questions asked respondents to assess life in the United States in the 21st century. Topics covered the future of terrorism, religion, spirituality, race relations, equality for minorities, poverty, environmental problems, free time, contact with intelligent life on other planets, and belief in Armageddon. Background information on respondents includes age, race, ethnicity, education, religion, political party, political orientation, family income, voter registration and participation history, and age of children in the household.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1998-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-03</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1998-03\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-03</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                            </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>           <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
