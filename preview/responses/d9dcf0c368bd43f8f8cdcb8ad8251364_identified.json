Identifying and tracking HIV exposed infants remains a significant challenge for many countries, meaning up to 80% of HIV exposed infants are estimated to be lost to follow up and do not receive critical, lifesaving interventions. This study focused on the facilitators and barriers of early infant diagnosis of HIV at six clinics of the Gb\\ufffd\\ufffdk\\ufffd\\ufffd region in C\\ufffd\\ufffdte d'Ivoire. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to answer research questions related to community, health system, and individual level facilitators and barriers to accessing early infant diagnosis (EID) services in public health facilities. Key findings reveal that challenges such as unpredictable turnaround time for the return of HIV test results and fear of stigma are important barriers to early infant diagnosis. Facilitating factors include the presence of on-site community counselors, who played key roles in the retention of caregivers into care and treatment services. Recommendations for improving EID services in clinics include more systematic application of national guidelines related to the organization of onsite services, greater government support for the role of community counselors in public health facilities, and a decentralization of virologic testing machines to reduce the turnaround time of test results for HIV exposed infants. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Thesis (Master's)--University of Washington, 2014 </summary> </entry> <entry> <title>Exploring RIG-I like receptor signaling: Regulation by DHX15 and RIGing the pathway for broad-spectrum antiviral immunity</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/1773/27377\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Pattabhi, Sowmya</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/1773/27377</id> <updated>2015-02-27T11:02:39Z</updated> <summary type=\"text\">Exploring RIG-I like receptor signaling: Regulation by DHX15 and RIGing the pathway for broad-spectrum antiviral immunity Pattabhi, Sowmya Retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is a cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptor essential for recognition of RNA viruses. RIG-I engagement of viral RNA activates downstream signaling through the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling adaptor (MAVS) and results in the production of type I interferons, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and the expression of innate immune genes that suppress virus infection. My work has been focused on understanding the regulation of RIG-I signaling and developing small molecule agonists that target the RIG-I-like receptors as a strategy to develop host-targeted, broad-spectrum antivirals that work to inhibit emerging and re-emerging RNA virus infections. This thesis focuses on the regulation of RIG-I signaling in the first part. To identify cofactors of RIG-I signaling, a proteomic approach coupled with assessment of innate immune signaling function was used to identify the DEAH-box RNA helicase, DHX15 as a RIG-I signaling partner. My work identifies DHX15, as a positive regulator that is essential for innate immune response to control viruses of the family- Paramyxoviridae (Sendai virus), Picornaviridae (Encephalomyocarditis virus) and Rhabdoviridae (Vesicular stomatitis virus) and characterizes DHX15 as a RNA helicase that binds RIG-I and melanoma differentiation associated factor 5 (MDA5) basally through interactions mediated by the DHX15 N-terminus and the RLR CARDs. RNA binding studies identify DHX15 as a pathogen recognition receptor that binds non-self single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). DHX15 and RIG-I bind dsRNA more efficiently than either protein alone, indicating that DHX15 serves as a PAMP co-receptor to enhance RLR signaling. In the second part, I hypothesize that small molecule agonists that target the RLR pathway and induce cell and tissue-wide innate antiviral immunity can be effectively used in therapeutic approaches to control RNA virus infections. A small molecule diversity library designed based on the ligand binding pocket within RIG-I, was used in a cell-based screening approach to identify compounds that drive IRF3 activation. Hit compounds identified in the screen differentially induce a discrete subset of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and antiviral genes. Correspondingly, compound administration before or after infection significantly decreased the viral RNA load in cultured cells that were infected with the family Flaviviridae West Nile virus (WNV), dengue virus (DV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), the Filoviridae Ebola virus (EBOV, Zaire), Orthomyxoviridae Influenza A virus (IAV, H3N2, Udorn strain) and Paramyxoviridae respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and concomitantly suppressed infectious virus production. This study thus identifies a novel class of immune-modulatory molecules that activate RLR signaling to promote host antiviral responses to broadly suppress infection by RNA viruses of distinct genera. These compounds target the host and therefore could be broad-spectrum and effectively developed as a first line of defense in controlling RNA viruses.

Although bNAbs have been observed in HIV-infected individuals, we are currently unable to elicit them through vaccination.  The difficulty associated with eliciting broadly reactive antibodies is rooted in the exceptional sequence, structural, and conformational diversity of the HIV-1 Envelope glycoprotein (Env), the sole target of neutralizing antibodies. In addition, we have an incomplete understanding of the factors that govern Env-antibody interactions, and we are poorly equipped to rationally manipulate these interactions in order to obtain desired antibody specificities through vaccination. This thesis explores structural heterogeneity in purified soluble Env immunogens and the antibodies that recognize them, in order to understand how structural diversity - generated through post-translational modifications or conformational flexibility - impacts Env-antibody interactions. First, I measured soluble Env ectodomain immunogen binding to the antibodies PG9 and PG16, which were reported to preferentially recognize the native Env trimer.  I tested the impact of glycosylation, proteolysis, and oligomerization state on exposure of the PG9/PG16 epitope and demonstrated that PG9/PG16 are less specific for the native trimer than previously reported.  Next, I used small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to characterize the solution structure and conformational dynamics of soluble monomeric gp120 Env proteins from four diverse HIV-1 isolates.  This work showed that while the overall subunit morphology is similar among diverse gp120 proteins, there are distinct differences in conformational dynamics.  I observed that more dynamic gp120 proteins were poorly recognized by conformation-dependent antibodies.  Finally, to examine the potential influence of antibody conformational dynamics on Env recognition, I measured changes in antibody paratope stability over the course of affinity maturation for the bNAbs VRC03 and VRC26, which target the CD4-binding site and a V2-quaternary epitope, respectively.  I observed that paratope stability does not increase uniformly or linearly over the course of affinity maturation for either antibody, although germline antibodies were relatively more dynamic than mature antibodies. Altogether, this work provides useful insight into the structural heterogeneity of purified Env immunogens and the role of conformational dynamics in modifying Env-antibody interactions.  These data suggest that targeted stabilization may facilitate rational manipulation of Env-antibody interactions during vaccination.

Rates of parental HIV disclosure cited in the literature range from 11-50%. We conducted a mixed methods study to examine rates of parental HIV disclosure and explore factors that influence a parent's decision to disclose their HIV status to their children in Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: Among HIV-infected parents enrolled in the ongoing Counseling and Testing for Children at Home (CATCH) study, we determined rates and cofactors of disclosure of parental HIV status to partners, family members and children. The study recruited HIV-infected adults from HIV treatment clinics and enrolled those who had at least one &lt;12 year old child of unknown HIV status. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with 6 parents to ascertain perceived barriers and facilitators of the process of disclosing one's HIV status to one's child and factors that influence the decision to disclose. Results: Among 74 adult participants, median age was 35 years (IQR 32-38) with a median of 5 years since HIV diagnosis; most (84%) were female. Although 77% had disclosed their HIV status to their partner, and 55% to another family member, only 4% had disclosed their HIV status to their child (p &lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Participants who had disclosed their HIV status to someone (partner, family member or other person) were more likely to be female, have knowledge of their partner's status, and have a longer time since HIV diagnosis. Five of the six parents interviewed in-depth planned to disclose their status to their children; all mentioned that the child's age or perceived maturity inhibited disclosure and that they feared causing their child anxiety or stress by disclosing their status. Parents mentioned that child sexual activity was a motivator for disclosure, as well as the belief that disclosing was the right thing to do and noted that peer or counseling support would be useful to gain insight on appropriate ways to disclose their status. Conclusions: The decision of parents to disclose their HIV status to their children is more complex than disclosure to other family members and is influenced by concerns regarding the child's ability to understand and process knowledge of their parents' illness and lack of insight on ways to appropriately disclose. Peer groups, counseling, and standardized guidance may be beneficial to facilitate parental disclosure. Thesis (Master's)--University of Washington, 2014 </summary> </entry> </feed> ",
