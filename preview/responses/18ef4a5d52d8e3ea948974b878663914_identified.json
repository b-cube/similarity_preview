The data are summarized by quarter degree cells and represent the time weighted average of drift direction and velocity for all drift buoys that entered the cell during the summary time period.  Twelve of the data sets are one month averages, one data set is a one year average from all the months.  The area covered is nominally the eastern Gulf of Mexico, but during the course of the study, the buoys drifted as far west as Texas.  These spatial extent, object count and range attribute metadata items apply in particular to the one-year average data set, however the general characteristics of the dataset (coordinate system, attributes and attribute definitions) apply to all thirteen. </abstract> <purpose> Knowledge of ocean currents is important for the general description of the ocean circulation, the transport of biological and chemical constituents, and the estimation of environmental resources that might be at risk from oil spills and/or pollution.  These data may provide useful short-term guidance for oil spill response operations because ocean currents affect the spread and movement of oil spilled on ocean waters.  Whether on not these data can provide that short-term guidance is contingent upon the existence of a data point in these data sets in the area of and during a similar month as a spill event.  These data are spotty and hence may not always provide that information.  It should be recognized that water movement in the Gulf is highly dependent on current wind conditions.  The general trends of ocean currents indicated by these historical data may be greatly modified by an unusual or short-term wind event. In the event of a spill, a NOAA response team can be summoned to develop sophisticated oil trajectory models reflecting current atmospheric and oceanographic conditions that are far superior to any modeling estimates that could be made with these data. </purpose> <supplinf> Trajectory plots of individual buoys, pictures of drifter buoys, and a week by week synopsis of the buoy activity is available at: &lt;URL:http://gulf.ocean.fsu.edu/~www/drifter.html&gt;  These metadata describe the Arc/Info coverage of name &apos;ocean_currents_egom_AVG_MMS_1997&apos;, the shapefile of the same name derived from it, and to large extent the other twelve monthly average dataset coverages and shapefiles.

Points that appear to fall somewhat inland on waterways are valid; they are based on 1/4 degree bin averages which may be centered inland, but are based on offshore coastal buoy positions.  It is important to recognize that grid cells comprising the study area were not each sampled by drift buoys every month.  Because they are drift buoys, they go where the current takes them and as a result the area sampled by the buoys is to some extent dictated by the then predominant current (although throughout the study buoys were regularly introduced into the study area by airplane and from several platform release points).  This has particular impact on the yearly average results.  Grid cells that had enough buoy days for the year to show a velocity vector for the cell represent only the average current conditions for the time period the buoys were in that area.  This is not the same as obtaining a velocity vector for the cell at regular intervals throughout the year to obtain an average.  One of the bins of the yearly average has a velocity value that is three times the value of any other in the dataset, and approximately ten times the value of its nearest bin neighbors.  This may possibly indicate an error in the source data, however the velocity value is not impossible. During certain periods of the year there is a strong current from the Yucatan to the Straits of Florida which spins off eddies to the west.  In the direction of this current and in these eddies, velocities of 150 cm/sec have been observed. </logic> <complete> All of the drift buoy data available from this study were used to calculate the monthly average in 1/4 Degree bins, where more than five buoy-days per month occurred in the bin. Because the yearly average bins can draw on all the months&apos; data it is more likely to pass the threshold for five buoy days than an individual month, thus the yearly average dataset has velocities for binf that may not occur in any of the monthly averages. </complete> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Minerals Management Service</origin> <pubdate>1998</pubdate> <title>Drift Buoy Ocean Current data for the Eastern Gulf of Mexico</title> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>computer file</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>19960205</begdate> <enddate>19970628</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <srccurr>Range of dates over which the drift buoy data were collected</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>BUOY DATA</srccitea> <srccontr>Ocean current direction, velocity, statistics for observations summarized</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc> BUOY DATA in the form of ASCII files was converted to point coverages in Arc/Info.
