U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service surveys were performed in February, March, August, and October and include wintering sea duck surveys (2008-2011), Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) surveys (2010-2011, 2012|x2|, 2014), and a South Carolina and Georgia Coast survey (2012). Across these ten surveys, marine birds were counted along transects and grouped into various distances (in nautical miles) from the coast. Species counts were then aggregated across surveys by month and distance from coast. Densities (birds per square kilometer) were calculated by dividing the total species count by the total area surveyed for a given month and distance from the coast. Density standard deviations are included to show the variation in density across surveys of a given month and distance from the coast. The number of surveys performed and surveys in which marine birds were present are also provided.]]></Abstract> <CRS>CRS:84</CRS> <CRS>EPSG:4326</CRS> <CRS>EPSG:3857</CRS>  <!-- alias 3857 --> <CRS>EPSG:102100</CRS> <EX_GeographicBoundingBox><westBoundLongitude>-80.983293</westBoundLongitude><eastBoundLongitude>-77.298002</eastBoundLongitude><southBoundLatitude>31.933339</southBoundLatitude><northBoundLatitude>33.851619</northBoundLatitude></EX_GeographicBoundingBox> <BoundingBox CRS=\"CRS:84\" minx=\"-80.983293\" miny=\"31.933339\" maxx=\"-77.298002\" maxy=\"33.851619\"/> <BoundingBox CRS=\"EPSG:4326\" minx=\"31.933339\" miny=\"-80.983293\" maxx=\"33.851619\" maxy=\"-77.298002\"/> <BoundingBox CRS=\"EPSG:3857\" minx=\"-9015018.927900\" miny=\"3754563.577300\" maxx=\"-8604774.219300\" maxy=\"4008895.438900\"/>         <Style>           <Name>default</Name>           <Title>7</Title>           <LegendURL width=\"118\" height=\"96\">             <Format>image/png</Format>             <OnlineResource xlink:href=\"http://coast.noaa.gov/arcgis/services/MarineCadastre/SouthCarolinaMarineBirdDensity/MapServer/WmsServer?request=GetLegendGraphic%26version=1.3.0%26format=image/png%26layer=7\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" />           </LegendURL>         </Style>       </Layer>     </Layer>   </Capability> </WMS_Capabilities> ",
