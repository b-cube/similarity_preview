Vitamin D deficiency is also increasing in prevalence, and there is emerging evidence linking vitamin D deficiency to impaired \\ufffd\\ufffd-cell function, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance, all of which are central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (Song &amp; Manson, 2010). Following NHS and University ethical approval Welsh domiciled participants (n = 116) with varying levels of glucose control attended the Department of Sport and Exercise laboratory three times over a twelve-month period to examine the relationship between vitamin D and glucose homeostasis. Significant associations were observed between 25(OH)D and measures of glycaemia, and a seasonal variation was observed in 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in this Welsh population (summer 71.3 \\ufffd\\ufffd 23.8; winter 42.6 \\ufffd\\ufffd 23.8 nmol/l). Participants with normal glucose control (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd6 mmol/l) had significantly (U = 884.00, p = 0.03) higher 25(OH)D concentrations than those with abnormal glucose control (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd 6.1 mmol/l). A randomised control trial failed to find an effect of vitamin D supplementation (2000 IU/day) and a fifteen-week cycling programme on measures of glycaemia and body composition in 36 healthy participants. There was a significant (23%) increase in vitamin D status in participants in the supplementation groups demonstrating the effectiveness of the dose administered. Combined with the body of evidence in this area (Pittas et al., 2007) the findings from this thesis provide some support for the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in the management and prevention of type 2 diabetes. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27037\"> <title>Stress responses during aerobic exercise in relation to motivational dominance and state</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27037</link> <description>Stress responses during aerobic exercise in relation to motivational dominance and state Joanne; Yusuke; Fabien D.; Rhys We examined the hypothesis that congruence between motivational dominance and state results in optimal psychological responses and performance during exercise. Twenty participants (10 telic dominant and 10 paratelic dominant) rated their stress at 5 min intervals as they cycled on an ergometer at gas exchange threshold for 30 min in both telic and paratelic state manipulated conditions. Participants then performed a test to exhaustion at a resistance equivalent to 110% of _V O2max. The hypothesized interaction between condition and dominance was significant for internal tension stress, as paratelic dominants were more stressed than telic dominants when exercising in the telic state and telic dominants were more stressed than paratelic dominants when exercising in the paratelic state. Similarly, the condition6dominance interaction for internal stress discrepancy was significant, as paratelic dominants reported greater internal stress discrepancy exercising in the telic compared with the paratelic state. Findings are discussed in relation to the application of reversal theory for understanding stress responses during aerobic exercise. </description> <dc:date>2011-02-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26811\"> <title>Oral tyrosine supplementation improves exercise capacity in the heat</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26811</link> <description>Oral tyrosine supplementation improves exercise capacity in the heat Les; Glen; Manfred; Rhys </description> <dc:date>2009-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26810\"> <title>Oral tyrosine supplementation improves exercise capacity in the heat</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/26810</link> <description>Oral tyrosine supplementation improves exercise capacity in the heat Les; Glen; Manfred; Rhys </description> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
