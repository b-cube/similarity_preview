Better understanding of this phenomenon was deemed very important by the assessment review panel. The vermilion snapper assessments conducted in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic have experienced difficulties contending with extremely high variances in size-at-age. The primary goal of this work is to collect life history information on red grouper and vermilion snapper. The project will focus on collecting reproductive samples from red grouper and age samples from vermilion snapper. The samples will be taken from the central and southwestern shelf of west Florida, which will complement samples from other areas. Information on habitat will be collected to compare possible differences in life history parameters among different habitat types. The project will conduct 14 eight-day trips over 18 mo to collect gonads and otoliths from red grouper and vermilion snapper. Samples, including length and weight of individual fish, will be collected according to NMFS protocol and delivered to NMFS for analyses. Specific sites will be sampled to allow NMFS scientists to identify potential differences between growth and reproductive rates among the selected sites.  </abstract>       <purpose>The primary goal of this work is to collect life history information on red grouper and vermilion snapper.</purpose>       <notes/>       <supplemental-info/>       <is-display-xml-formats>Y</is-display-xml-formats>       <data-status>Complete</data-status>       <fgdc-data-status>Complete</fgdc-data-status>       <org-id>1081</org-id>       <owner-org-name>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</owner-org-name>       <owner-org-acro>SEFSC</owner-org-acro>       <catalog-control-state>9</catalog-control-state>       <parent-cat-id>9386</parent-cat-id>       <parent-cat-type-code>PRJ</parent-cat-type-code>       <parent-title>Cooperative Project Sampling of the Vertical Line Fishery Sampling reproductive and hard parts Tissue of Vermilion Snapper and red Grouper in the eastern Gulf of Mexico</parent-title>       <created-by>Lee Weinberger</created-by>       <created-by-pers-id>1279</created-by-pers-id>       <record-created>2013-07-02T12:24:22</record-created>       <record-last-modified>2014-11-24T07:22:35</record-last-modified>       <record-published>2014-11-24</record-published>       <publication-status>Public</publication-status>       <metadata-last-modification-date>2014-11-24</metadata-last-modification-date>       <metadata-next-review-date>2015-11-25</metadata-next-review-date>       <linking-share-level>Public</linking-share-level>    </common-information>    <physical-location>       <organization>Southeast Fisheries Science Center</organization>       <city>Miami</city>       <state-province>FL</state-province>       <country>USA</country>    </physical-location>    <data-set type=\"Mixed\">       <maintenance-frequency>None planned</maintenance-frequency>       <source-media-type>disc</source-media-type>    </data-set>    <keywords>       <theme-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">Vermillion Snapper, Red Grouper, fish master inc., fish master, na05nmf4540039, eric schmidt, snapper, grouper, age samples, life history, habitat, gonads, otoliths, growth, reproductive rates, 05crp017</keyword-list>       </theme-keywords>       <spatial-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">gulf of mexico, gom, florida, southwestern shelf west florida, central shelf west florida</keyword-list>       </spatial-keywords>       <stratum-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">species, length, weight</keyword-list>       </stratum-keywords>       <temporal-keywords>          <keyword-list thesaurus=\"None\">2006, 2007</keyword-list>       </temporal-keywords>    </keywords>    <data-attributes/>    <support-roles>       <support-role ccid=\"166165\"                     type=\"\"                     last-modified=\"\"                     created=\"\"                     org=\"1081\"                     person=\"2818\"                     support-role=\"2680\">          <role>Distributor</role>          <role-definition>&lt;F6.1&gt;
