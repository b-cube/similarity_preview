Measurements were made using a variety of magnetometer systems with typical accuracies of 1 to 10 nanotesla (nT). The grids presented in this report were made from numerous individual grids that were mathematically merged together using standard techniques.  Individual metadata files exist for USGS gridded data created from digital flight-line data (see USGS Open-File Report 02-0361). The data in the original grids have been processed using formulas and methods that are not usually documented but that represent industry standard practices for airborne data reduction.</attraccr>         </attracc>         <logic>The data in this file were collected by various contractors or groups who were responsible for collecting and processing the data. The data used to make these grids were collected using different instruments (magnetometers, altimeters, navigational systems) throughout the survey, but were usually consistent within each survey. Survey contracts specified the conditions and specifications under which these data were collected.  Standard industry practices of the time were followed in data collection and processing.</logic>         <complete>The North American Magnetic Anomaly grids were compiled from the best available aermomagnetic surveys publicly available in 2002.  Best available would be data having the highest resolution, closest line-spacing, most accurate instrumentation, most accurate flight-elevation surface, and similar specifications commonly used in the airborne surveying industry.  In many areas, only one survey was available. In many offshore areas and some onshore areas, no data were available at all, and these areas were left blank.</complete>         <posacc>             <horizpa>                 <horizpar>Flight Path Recovery - before about 1975 Horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect data were determined by reconciling down-looking photographs (recorded on continuous-strip film) with topographic maps and orthophotoquadrangle maps.  Fiducial numbers and marks, impressed on any paper strips that were recording data or added to magnetic tape records, were included as a function of time to further reconcile location with instrumentation. Flight Path Recovery - before about 1990 Horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect data were determined using aircraft navigational aids such as line-of-sight electronic systems that measure the distances from each of two ground stations to the aircraft using microwave or radio transmitters. Flight Path Recovery - after about 1990 Horizontal position of the survey aircraft used to collect data were determined using GPS satellite navigation.</horizpar>             </horizpa>             <vertacc>                 <vertaccr>The aircraft vertical position was determined using the navigational positioning equipment on the aircraft, which were radar altimeter and barometric altimeter. Radar altimeters are estimated to have an error of 2-5% of the altitude (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication). Barometric altimeters are quite accurate, but are typically operated in an uncorrected mode.  The diurnal variation in air pressure over the course of a flight can produce a 50-100 ft error in the barometric altimeter reading.  In addition, pressure microcells create short-period air pressure changes equivalent to about 10 ft under typical conditions (Richard Hansen, PRJ, Inc., written communication) The magnetometer was carried on a \"stinger\" that was attached to the aircraft or was carried in a bird towed on a line that was below the aircraft.  The bird as it is towed is slightly behind the aircraft and therefore the vertical distance between the magnetometer and the aircraft is slightly less than the length of the line but remains constant for the survey. Data were either collected at a fixed barometric altitude or were collected as a draped survey having an average terrain clearance above the ground.  Because aircraft, especially airplanes, cannot safely maintain a constant terrain clearance, error in vertical position is introduced.</vertaccr>             </vertacc>         </posacc>         <lineage>             <procstep>                 <procdesc>We obtained all available aeromagnetic surveys.

For the U.S. part, scientists merged groups of surveys by state or groups of states.  States were merged into regions, and regions into countries.

Because wavelengths greater than roughly 150 km are unreliable in the compilation, applying a high-pass wavelength filter would appear to be a viable solution to remove these unreliable wavelengths.  However, removing wavelengths less than 500 km from the merged grid creates artifacts, such as spurious separation of continuous anomalies.  Therefore, we removed anomalies with wavelengths greater than 500 km from the merged grid to reduce the effects caused by the erroneous long wavelengths but maintaining continuity of anomalies.  The correction was accomplished by transforming the merged grid to the frequency domain, filtering the transformed data with a long-wavelength cutoff at 500 km, and subtracting the long-wavelength data grid from the merged grid.</procdesc>                 <procdate>2002</procdate>             </procstep>             <procstep>                 <procdesc>An equivalent source method based on long-wavelength characterization using satellite data was used to correct for long-wavelength shifts. We produced an aeromagnetic grid in which the wavelengths longer than 500 km have been replaced by downward-continued CHAMP satellite data.  Steps 0 and 6 were performed by Bob Kucks.  Steps 1-4 were performed by Tiku Ravat. Step 5 was performed by Jeff Phillips. 0. The North American 1 km merged grid was decimated to 5 km. 1. This 5 km grid was converted to a 0.05 degree grid.  This grid was low-pass filtered using a Gaussian filter with a 500 km cutoff, then decimated to 1 degree. 2. A joint inversion of this 1 degree low-pass aeromagnetic grid and CHAMP satellite data, with the aeromagnetic data weighted very low, produced a stabilized downward continuation of the CHAMP data. 3. The inverted data were interpolated to 0.05 degree and again low-pass filtered using the same Gaussian 500 km filter to remove 4. The low-pass grid from step 1 was subtracted from the original 0.05 degree aeromagnetic grid to create a 500 km high-pass aeromagnetic grid.  This grid was added to the low-pass inverted grid from step 3 to get a corrected 0.05 degree aeromagnetic grid. 5. The corrected 0.05 aeromagnetic degree grid was projected to the DNAG projection and regridded to 5 km.  This was subtracted from the decimated 5 km aeromagnetic grid to generate a 5 km correction grid. A matched filter was used to remove short-wavelength artifacts resulting from the projection and regridding process. 6. The resulting 5 km correction grid was regridded to the original 1 km grid and subtracted from the original 1 km aeromagnetic grid to generate the final 1 km corrected aeromagnetic grid.</procdesc>                 <procdate>2002</procdate>             </procstep>         </lineage>     </dataqual>     <spdoinfo>         <direct>raster</direct>         <rastinfo>             <rasttype>grid cell</rasttype>             <rowcount>3000</rowcount>             <colcount>5000</colcount>         </rastinfo>     </spdoinfo>     <spref>         <horizsys>             <planar>                 <mapproj>                     <mapprojn>Transverse Mercator</mapprojn>                     <transmer>                         <sfctrmer>0.926</sfctrmer>                         <longcm>-100.0</longcm>                         <latprjo>0</latprjo>                         <feast>0</feast>                         <fnorth>0</fnorth>                     </transmer>                 </mapproj>                 <planci>                     <plance>row and column</plance>                     <coordrep>                         <absres>1000</absres>                         <ordres>1000</ordres>                     </coordrep>                     <plandu>meters</plandu>                 </planci>             </planar>             <geodetic>                 <horizdn>DNAG</horizdn>                 <ellips>STM1987</ellips>                 <semiaxis>6371204.0</semiaxis>                 <denflat>1.0</denflat>             </geodetic>         </horizsys>     </spref>     <eainfo>         <detailed>             <enttyp>                 <enttypl>USmag_origmrg.grd</enttypl>                 <enttypd>Grid containing the residual total intensity of the Earth's magnetic field.</enttypd>             </enttyp>             <attr>                 <attrlabl>grid cell</attrlabl>                 <attrdef>Residual total intensity of Earth's magnetic field.

The most commonly used reference field is determined from a model developed by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA).  The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF), is a predictive model adopted at the beginning of a model period (e.g. in 1989 for 1990-1995). After the model period, a revised definitive model is adopted, the DGRF.

However, removing wavelengths less than 500 km from the merged grid creates artifacts, such as spurious separation of continuous anomalies.  Therefore, we removed anomalies with wavelengths greater than 500 km from the merged grid to reduce the effects caused by the erroneous long wavelengths but maintaining continuity of anomalies.  The correction was accomplished by transforming the merged grid to the frequency domain, filtering the transformed data with a long-wavelength cutoff at 500 km, and subtracting the long-wavelength data grid from the merged grid.</attrdef>                 <attrdefs>standard</attrdefs>                 <attrdomv>                     <rdom>                         <rdommin>-5033.9</rdommin>                         <rdommax>13218.7</rdommax>                         <attrunit>nanoteslas</attrunit>                     </rdom>                 </attrdomv>                 <attrdomv>                     <edom>                         <edomv>-1.0E+32</edomv>                         <edomvd>missing data</edomvd>                     </edom>                 </attrdomv>             </attr>         </detailed>         <detailed>             <enttyp>                 <enttypl>USmag_CM.grd</enttypl>                 <enttypd>Grid made by removing a magnetic field that was calculated from satellite magnetic data by Tiku Ravat of of Southern Illinois University.</enttypd>             </enttyp>             <attr>                 <attrlabl>grid cell</attrlabl>                 <attrdef>An equivalent source method based on long-wavelength characterization using satellite data was used to correct for long-wavelength shifts. We produced an aeromagnetic grid in which the wavelengths longer than 500 km have been replaced by downward-continued CHAMP satellite data.  Steps 0 and 6 were performed by Bob Kucks.  Steps 1-4 were performed by Tiku Ravat. Step 5 was performed by Jeff Phillips. 0. The North American 1 km merged grid was decimated to 5 km. 1. This 5 km grid was converted to a 0.05 degree grid.  This grid was low-pass filtered using a Gaussian filter with a 500 km cutoff, then decimated to 1 degree. 2. A joint inversion of this 1 degree low-pass aeromagnetic grid and CHAMP satellite data, with the aeromagnetic data weighted very low, produced a stabilized downward continuation of the CHAMP data. 3. The inverted data were interpolated to 0.05 degree and again low-pass filtered using the same Gaussian 500 km filter to remove 4. The low-pass grid from step 1 was subtracted from the original 0.05 degree aeromagnetic grid to create a 500 km high-pass aeromagnetic grid.  This grid was added to the low-pass inverted grid from step 3 to get a corrected 0.05 degree aeromagnetic grid. 5. The corrected 0.05 aeromagnetic degree grid was projected to the DNAG projection and regridded to 5 km.  This was subtracted from the decimated 5 km aeromagnetic grid to generate a 5 km correction grid. A matched filter was used to remove short-wavelength artifacts resulting from the projection and regridding process. 6. The resulting 5 km correction grid was regridded to the original 1 km grid and subtracted from the original 1 km aeromagnetic grid to generate the final 1 km corrected aeromagnetic grid.</attrdef>                 <attrdefs>Ravat, D., Whaler, K.A., Pilkington, M., Sabaka, T., and Purucker, M., 2002, Compatibility of high-altitude aeromagnetic and satellite-altitude magnetic anomalies over Canada: Geophysics, v. 67, p. 546-554.</attrdefs>                 <attrdomv>                     <rdom>                         <rdommin>-5090</rdommin>                         <rdommax>13227</rdommax>                         <attrunit>nanoteslas</attrunit>                     </rdom>                 </attrdomv>                 <attrdomv>                     <edom>                         <edomv>-1.0E+32</edomv>                         <edomvd>missing data</edomvd>                     </edom>                 </attrdomv>             </attr>         </detailed>     </eainfo>     <distinfo>         <distrib>             <cntinfo>                 <cntorgp>                     <cntorg>DVD distributor: USGS Information Services</cntorg>                 </cntorgp>                 <cntaddr>                     <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>                     <address>Box 25286, Building 810 Denver Federal Center</address>                     <city>Denver</city>                     <state>CO</state>                     <postal>80225</postal>                     <country>USA</country>                 </cntaddr>                 <cntvoice>303-202-4700</cntvoice>                 <cntemail>www.usgs.gov/pubprod</cntemail>             </cntinfo>         </distrib>         <resdesc>USGS Open-File Report OFR 02-0414</resdesc>         <distliab>Although all data published in these grids have been used by the USGS, no warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the USGS as to the accuracy of the data and related materials.
