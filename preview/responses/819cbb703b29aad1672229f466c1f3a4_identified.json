The polygon boundaries are approximate since the U.S. Postal Service assigns zip codes to linear features (streets), not to geographic areas. Since neither the U.S. Postal Service nor the U.S. Census Bureau maintains official zip code boundary files or maps, LMIC created this file in order to be able to map data aggregated by zip code.  LMIC worked with regional post office sites to delineate areas within which letter carriers delivered mail with the same zip code.</abstract> <purpose>For general reference and generalized address matching and mapping.</purpose> <supplinf>Minnesota</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1991</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>The original file was created in 1985 and was updated in 1991.

File created by the Metropolitan Council.  For more information, see http://www.datafinder.org/metadata/zip5.htm or call 651-602-1363.  2.  The U.S. Census Bureau created Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) for the 2000 Census. ZCTAs are approximate area representations of United States Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas; they are not USPS ZIP Codes. The U.S. Census Bureau has created ZCTAs to meet requests by data users for statistical data by ZIP Code area. The term ZCTA was originated to differentiate between true USPS ZIP Codes and these approximations.  For more information, see http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cob/zt_metadata.html .  3.  For a zip code look-up service and zip code FAQ, see the U.S. Postal Service website:  http://www.usps.com/ncsc/ziplookup/lookupmenu.htm .  Note:  the USPS does not create or maintain zip code maps or polygon data sets.</title> </citeinfo> </crossref> </idinfo> <dataqual> <attracc> <attraccr>LMIC produced checkplots and compared them visually to the hand-drawn maps.</attraccr> </attracc> <logic>Data are stored within a valid ARC/INFO coverage or shapefile data structure.</logic> <complete>Zip code polygon mapping is approximate, since zip codes correspond to street addresses (linear features) not to geographic areas (polygons).  It is particularly difficult in rural areas to match zip codes to areas. In addition, not all zip codes are geographically based and some would be represented by points. In these cases, so that data could be mapped, zip codes were represented by small square areas.  The file has not been updated since 1991, so any zip codes created after that time (e.g., 55155 for state agencies, which is also an example of a non-geographically based zip code) are not included.</complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar>No statistical analysis has been performed.

At each site, the post office had one set of maps outlining the areas where the carriers delivered mail with each zip code. The boundaries were hand-drawn on Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) county highway maps (either 1:126,720 or 1:63,360 scale). The supervisor of mail carriers reviewed the maps with LMIC staff, noting any boundaries that had changed. Since there was only one set of original maps, LMIC staff copied the information by outlining those areas with marker pens on a clean set of Mn/DOT maps. Any zip code that did not have geographic areas was represented by a small square. The lines were then digitized at LMIC using an early version of ARC/INFO (1, 2 or 3) to create coverages.  In 1991, after the release of 1990 U.S. Census data aggregated by zipcode, LMIC matched the Census data with the zip code polygons. Approximately 800 out of 900 zip codes matched well. The remaining polygons were checked with the regional post office sites to reconcile the discrepancies. This process captured the new zip codes that had been created between 1985 and 1990. A further check was conducted during a project for the Department of Revenue. A file from the Dept. of Revenue that listed each zip code from which people had filed taxes matched well with the revised 1991 zip code file.  Two corrections were made in 1995: 1.  Zip code 55306 in Dakota County was added. 2.  The file was dissolved out for adjacent zipcode areas with the same zip code. After the dissolve was done, the only zip code areas with multiple discontiguous polygons in file were:  55005, 55090, 55115, 55975 and 56763 (each with two polygons).</procdesc> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref></indspref> <direct>Vector</direct> <mgmg3obj>arc, node</mgmg3obj> <mgmg3til>State</mgmg3til> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres></latres> <longres></longres> </geograph> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn></mapprojn> <mgmg4par></mgmg4par> <otherprj></otherprj> </mapproj> <gridsys> <gridsysn>UTM</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>15E</utmzone> </utm> <spcs> <spcszone></spcszone> </spcs> <mgmg4coz></mgmg4coz> <mgmg4adj>None</mgmg4adj> </gridsys> <planci> <coordrep> <absres></absres> <ordres></ordres> </coordrep> <distbrep> <distres>Unknown</distres> </distbrep> <plandu>Meters</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>NAD83</horizdn> <ellips>GRS80</ellips> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum>Not applicable</altdatum> <altunits></altunits> </altsys> <depthsys> <depthdn>Not applicable</depthdn> <depthdu></depthdu> </depthsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>Zip-code (Zip_code in shapefile format):  Contains the 5-digit zip code for each polygon.
