Those surveyed answered   questions concerning Hurricane Andrew, Congress, the national   economy, the federal budget deficit, the concern of the presidential   candidates for the needs and problems of the people, and the one   issue that the respondent wished the presidential candidates would   talk about. Respondents were also asked to give their approval rating   of George Bush with respect to his handling of the presidency,   foreign affairs, Hurricane Andrew, and the economy. Background   information on respondents includes sex, age, race, education,   religious preference, family income, financial situation, political   orientation, party preference, voter registration status, and vote  choices in the 1984 and 1988 presidential elections.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1992-09-10\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-09-10</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1992-09-14\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-09-14</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1992-09-10\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-09-10</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"1992-09-14\" cycle=\"P1\">1992-09-14</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Florida</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Residents of Florida aged 18 and over having telephones at  home.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    A variation of random-digit dialing using primary sampling   units (PSUs) was employed, consisting of blocks of 100 telephone   numbers identical through the eighth digit and stratified by   geographic region, area code, and size of place.
