Kjelldahl and G. Baronoski Over the last 20 years, visualization courses have been developed and offered at universities around the world. Many of these courses use established visualization libraries and tools (e.g., VTK, ParaView, AVS, VisIt) as a way to provide students a hands-on experience, allowing them to prototype and explore different visualization techniques. In this paper, we describe our experiences using VisTrails as a platform to teach scientific visualization. VisTrails is an open-source system that was designed to support exploratory computational tasks such as visualization and data analysis. Unlike previous scientific workflow and visualization systems, VisTrails provides a comprehensive provenance management infrastructure. We discuss how different features of the system, and in particular, the provenance information have changed the dynamics of the Scientific Visualization course we offer at the University of Utah. We also describe our initial attempts at using the provenance information to better assess our teaching techniques and student performance. </description> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10.2312/eged.20101016.057-062\"> <title>Computer Graphics for Information System Programmers</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10.2312/eged.20101016.057-062</link> <description>Computer Graphics for Information System Programmers Linares-Pellicer, Jordi; Carrasquer-Moya, Empar; Esparza-Peidro, Javier; Mic\\ufffd\\ufffd-Tormos, Pau L. Kjelldahl and G. Baronoski An introductory computer graphics course is always a challenge. It is even more so if computer graphics is an additional component to a general computer science degree. In this instance, it is really important to discuss which computer graphics topics are relevant for tomorrow s programmers and engineers who are going to work mainly in Information Systems developments and data management software. The objective of this this paper is to consider what should be taught to future professionals who, not being directly involved in the development of specific computer graphics applications, will possibly need to use computer graphics in their developments. We will describe how this objective can be achieved by a carefully selected set of programming assignments. </description> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10.2312/eged.20101015.049-056\"> <title>Educating Students in Official Statistics using Embedded Geovisual Analytics Storytelling Methods</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10.2312/eged.20101015.049-056</link> <description>Educating Students in Official Statistics using Embedded Geovisual Analytics Storytelling Methods Jern, Mikael L. Kjelldahl and G. Baronoski Official statistics such as demographics, environment, health, social-economy and education from national and sub-national sources are a rich and important source of information for many important aspects of life and should be considered to be more used and acknowledged in education. Educators and their students would be able to get informed and at the same time participate in increasing the knowledge on how life is lived and can be improved. A lot of this statistics information can be reached on the Internet. This is producing what is often called information overload and causing people to be increasingly faced with the problems of filtering and interpreting enormous quantities of information. We know that official statistics are used as a more or less important background for decisions especially in public planning and policy making. However, in education, official statistics are much less recognized and used than they ought to be and among the informed public they are even less used. Web-enabled GeoAnalytics is a technique that can help illustrating complex statistical data which for the eye are hard to uncover or even are not possible to perceive or interpret. In this paper, we introduce novel  storytelling  means for the author (educator) to 1) select any spatio-temporal and multidimensional national or sub-national statistical data, 2) explore and discern trends and patterns, 3) then orchestrate and describe metadata, 4) collaborate with colleagues to confirm and 5) finally publish essential gained insight and knowledge embedded as dynamic visualization  Vislet  in blogs or wikis with associate metadata. The author can guide the reader in the directions of both context and discovery while at the same time follow the analyst s way of logical reasoning. We are moving away from a clear distinction between authors and readers affecting the process through which knowledge is created and the traditional models which support editorial work. Value no longer relies solely on the content but also on the ability to access this information. Audiences are increasingly gathered around Web enabled technologies and this distribution channel is, more than ever, in control of the information value chain. </description> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10.2312/eged.20101014.041-048\"> <title>Experimental Feedback on Prog and Play, a Serious Game for Programming Practice</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10.2312/eged.20101014.041-048</link> <description>Experimental Feedback on Prog and Play, a Serious Game for Programming Practice Muratet, Mathieu; Torguet, Patrice; Viallet, Fabienne; Jessel, Jean-Pierre L. Kjelldahl and G. Baronoski This paper presents an experimental feedback on a serious game dedicated to strengthening programming skills. This serious game called Prog&amp;Play is built on an open source realtime strategy game. Its goal is to be compatible with different students, teachers and institutions. We propose an iterative evaluation in order to improve it while experiments are running. Through this evaluation, we define a framework that will be tested by third parties in different contexts and we analyse negative points and mistakes in order to improve the project. In every instance, evaluation is beneficial and allows establishing a communication about the implemented practices. </description> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
