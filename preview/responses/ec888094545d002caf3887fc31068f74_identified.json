The objectives of the MDB were to: &#13; 1. Directly increase the number of deposited items within each repository.&#13; 2. Identify per unit costs, in both time and money, for repository item deposit. &#13; 3. Engage institution staff with the repository deposit process in an attempt to embed the processes involved within their working cycle and further increase deposit.&#13; 4. Encourage further deposit by academic staff within each repository through the presence of new repository deposits.&#13; &#13; It is the second objective which provides the focus for this paper. </description> <dc:date>2011-04-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/4636\"> <title>Collaboration nation: the building of the Welsh Repository Network</title> <link>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/4636</link> <description>Collaboration nation: the building of the Welsh Repository Network Knowles, Jackie Abstract: Purpose \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The purpose of this paper is to disseminate information about the Welsh Repository Network (WRN), innovative work being undertaken to build an integrated network of institutional digital repositories. A collaborative approach, in particular through the provision of centralised technical and organisational support, has demonstrated improvement in the use and curation of digital repository content across Wales. &#13; &#13; Design/methodology/approach \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The vision of the WRN has been delivered using two project phases; the first establishing technical infrastructure followed by a phase focussing on user engagement, content generation and enhancement of repository interfaces. The methodologies used have involved gathering technical requirements and procurement and installation of repository solutions, including a cash injection of \\ufffd\\ufffd4,000 per institution to purchase suitable hardware. The current phase explores experimental approaches to stimulate engagement, embed solutions and generate content to populate the repositories. Collaboration is the overarching theme driving the approach. &#13; &#13; Findings \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The WRN is now a physical entity offering complete national coverage. Vitally, the WRN is also functioning as a virtual network. The variety of technical repository solutions implemented reflect the variety of institutions with makeup, current computing infrastructure and staffing levels all influencing the chosen infrastructure. Current challenges focus on organisational aspects of engagement; culture change, strategic buy-in and policy issues have all proved significant. &#13; &#13; Originality/value \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd The WRN demonstrates that collaboration results in success. The model can inform and lead others considering repository matters and has provided findings of interest and value to many wider communities from repository specific, through information and research management to the information profession as whole. </description> <dc:date>2010-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> </rdf:RDF> ",
