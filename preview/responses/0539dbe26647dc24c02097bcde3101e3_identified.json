Hydrometric Areas are used to organise river flow measurement and hydrometric data collection in the UK. Hydrometric Areas are either integral river catchments having one or more outlets to the sea or tidal estuary, or they may include several contiguous river catchments having topographical similarity but separate tidal outlets. In mainland Britain they are numbered from 1 to 97 in clockwise order around the coast commencing in north east Scotland. The larger islands and groups of islands are numbered from 100-108. Ireland has a unified numbering system from 1 to 40 commencing with the River Foyle catchment and circulating clockwise; not all Irish Hydrometric Areas, however, have an outlet to the coast. Only those Hydrometric Areas covering Great Britain and Northern Ireland are included in this dataset. The boundaries between hydrometric areas correspond to catchment boundaries as digitally-derived from CEH Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model (IHDTM) using a catchment definition program. It should be noticed that the Northern Ireland data are clipped to its political boundary so not every Hydrometric Area in this region is completely represented. The naming and numbering convention for the hydrometric areas in Great Britain was originally defined by the Inland Water Survey Committee (and first published in the Surface Water Year-Book of Great Britain 1936-37). For Northern Ireland the system was developed by a multi-agency working group in the 1970s (and first published in Surface Water: United Kingdom 1971-73. Note that full citations of those two publications are provided as additional information source. This dataset represent the same entities as the IHU Hydrometric Areas of the UK without Coastline, however, the outer boundaries of the units follow coastline published by the Ordnance Survey (Meridian 2), rather than the boundaries of the CEH Integrated Hydrological Digital Terrain Model. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Hydrography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>England</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Scotland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometric areas</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hydrometry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-06-24T13:10:29Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5dc179dc-f692-49ba-9326-a6893a503f6e\">     <title>Gridded estimates of daily and monthly areal rainfall for the United Kingdom (1890-2012) [CEH-GEAR]</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/5dc179dc-f692-49ba-9326-a6893a503f6e</link>     <description>1 km gridded estimates of daily and monthly rainfall for Great-Britain and Northern Ireland (together with approximately 3000 km2 of catchment in the Republic of Ireland) from 1890 to 2012. The rainfall estimates are derived from the Met Office national database of observed precipitation. To derive the estimates, monthly and daily (when complete month available) precipitation totals from the UK rain gauge network are used. The natural neighbour interpolation methodology, including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall, was used to generate the daily and monthly estimates. The estimated rainfall on a given day refers to the rainfall amount precipitated in 24 hours between 9am on that day until 9am on the following day.  The CEH-GEAR dataset has been developed according to the guidance provided in BS 7843-4:2012.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Nuria Bachiller-Jareno</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Meteorological geographical features</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Northern Ireland</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Daily</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>monthly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Precipitation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>areal rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>raingauge</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DCC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-06-19T09:24:49Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/f3723162-4fed-4d9d-92c6-dd17412fa37b\">     <title>Future flows hydrology data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/f3723162-4fed-4d9d-92c6-dd17412fa37b</link>     <description>Future Flows Hydrology (FF-HydMod-PPE) is an 11-member ensemble projections of river flow and groundwater levels time series for 283 catchments and 24 boreholes in Great Britain.

The data are uncensored and provide a basis for research purposes, and must be viewed in this light. Information on analytical methodologies is also available, including detection limits, from which the user can choose how the data might be interpreted.  The basins studied were the Tweed, Wear, Humber, Great Ouse and Thames. One tributary (the Teviot) and two main-stem sites were monitored in the Tweed Catchment. One site around two-thirds down the catchment of the River Wear was monitored. Humber Basin Monitoring was undertaken for all the tributaries especially near their downstream limits. The Great Ouse was monitored around half way down the catchment. The Thames catchment was monitored upstream and downstream of sewage inputs to the river, prior and post effluent stripping of phosphorus.  This work formed part of a major UK initiative introduced in the early 1990s, the Land Ocean Interaction Study, LOIS, to examine water, chemical and sediment fluxes from the eastern UK rivers to the North Sea. As part of this and subsequent work, the initiative was extended to examine a range of catchment basins, from rural to agricultural and industrial/urban impacted ones.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacky Chaplow</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Analytical chemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrochemistry</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>River</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>rainfall</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>river water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>United Kingdom</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water Resources</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-09-03T08:26:33Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/bad1514f-119e-44a4-8e1e-442735bb9797\">     <title>Future flows climate data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/bad1514f-119e-44a4-8e1e-442735bb9797</link>     <description>Future Flows Climate (FF-HadRM3-PPE) is an 11-member ensemble climate projection for Great Britain at a 1-km resolution spanning from 1950 to 2098. It was specifically developed for hydrological application and contain daily time series of Available Precipitation, which is the precipiated water available to hydrological processes after delays due to snow and ice storage are accounted for; and monthly reference Potential Evapotranspiration calculated using the FAO56 method. Future Flows Climate is derived from the Hadley Centre's Regional climate projection ensemble HadRM3-PPE based on 11 different variants of the regional climate model run under the SRES A1B emission scenario. HadRM3-PPE is underpinning the UKCP09 products. Bias correction and spatial downscaling were applied to the total precpitation and air temperature variables before Future Flows Climate APr and PE were generated.
