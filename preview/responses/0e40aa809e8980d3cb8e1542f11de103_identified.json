The origin of this data is Mn/DOT's Microstation CAD system, where all linework, feature type coding, and symbolization is stored and updated.  To produce these graphic files, Mn/DOT exported the data from Microstation into postscript files. LMIC then imported the data into Adobe Acrobat Distiller to create the PDF files. Areal extents of the files mirror the paper maps distributed by Mn/DOT:  single maps for small counties, multiple map sheets for larger counties. These files are static and represent the Mn/DOT County Highway Map as of January 1, 2002.</abstract> <purpose>These files can be used to print large-format maps.</purpose> <supplinf>Minnesota, Statewide</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>20020101</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Original County Highway Map .eps files were created from linework in Mn/DOT Microstation CAD system as of January 1, 2002. Within the CAD system, roads, railroads, and minor civil division (city and township boundaries) are updated annually.  (Township roads are updated annually to the extent that changes are reported to Mn/DOT.) Rivers, lakes, and section lines were originally captured from USGS 7.5-minute topographic maps.  Water feature name changes reported through the Minnesota Board of Geographic Names are updated.  Information on cultural features (for example, pipelines, transmission lines, dwellings, public service facilities)  were captured from aerial photography in the 1970's and are not routinely updated.</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>Updates to the Mn/DOT Microstation CAD are made continuously; there is no plan in place to update static PDF versions.

Creation of Minnesota County Highway Maps 2001 Postscript (.eps) files (Minnesota Department of Transportation):  a. Linework for all features is digitized into the Microstation CAD system at Mn/DOT. Features include roads, rivers, lakes, ditches, public land survey lines, municipal  boundaries, and cultural features. Originally, many of these features had been digitized by Mn/DOT from the USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic maps. Cultural features were captured from 1970's aerial photography. Road and municipal boundary information is updated continually. Other features are updated or corrected on a less regular basis. Cultural features have not been systematically updated since the original data capture.   The CAD system information includes linework coded by feature type (level) and map symbolization. The map symbolization is used to create the Mn/DOT County Highway Map Series. Data are stored by County Highway Map map sheet. Smaller counties can be represented on a single map sheet; larger counties require multiple sheets.  (Note: from the Microstation CAD system, the linework, by feature type (level) is exported into Arc/Info, where attribute information is added. This set of GIS files becomes the basis for the Mn/DOT Basemap GIS data set).  b. Data for each county highway map sheet is exported from the Microstation CAD system as an .eps (postscript) file.  Linework within the CAD system is in UTM Zone 15, NAD83.  The .eps file itself has no projection.  2. Conversion of Minnesota County Highway Maps Postscript (.eps) files to .PDF format (Land Management Information Center):  a. LMIC obtained from Mn/DOT a set of County Highway Map map sheet .eps files.  b. Conversion of .eps files to PDF files:  .eps files were loaded into Adobe Acrobat Distiller using 600 dpi conversion. The Adobe Acrobat Distiller format is .pdf.  The .pdf files are Acrobat 4 compatible.</procdesc> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref>Not applicable</indspref> <direct></direct> <mgmg3obj></mgmg3obj> <mgmg3til>Mn/DOT County Highway Map Sheets (full or partial county)</mgmg3til> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres></latres> <longres></longres> </geograph> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn></mapprojn> <mgmg4par></mgmg4par> <otherprj></otherprj> </mapproj> <gridsys> <gridsysn></gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone></utmzone> </utm> <spcs> <spcszone></spcszone> </spcs> <mgmg4coz></mgmg4coz> <mgmg4adj></mgmg4adj> </gridsys> <planci> <coordrep> <absres></absres> <ordres></ordres> </coordrep> <distbrep> <distres></distres> </distbrep> <plandu></plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn></horizdn> <ellips></ellips> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum></altdatum> <altunits></altunits> </altsys> <depthsys> <depthdn></depthdn> <depthdu></depthdu> </depthsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>The graphic is an image made up of a combination of features arranged cartographically.
