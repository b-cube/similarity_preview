The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census.  For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract.  Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.  Most BGs                                    were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP).  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant.  A BG usually covers a contiguous area.  Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract.  Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas.  BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9.  BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas.  For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into                                    the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore.  The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas.    </abstract>       <purpose>     In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.    </purpose>       <langdata Sync=\"TRUE\">en</langdata>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>201001</begdate>           <enddate>201007</enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>Publication Date</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>Complete</progress>       <update>TIGER/Line Shapefiles are extracted from the Census MAF/TIGER database.

Segments making up the outer and inner boundaries of a polygon tie end-to-end to completely enclose the area.  All polygons are tested for closure. The Census Bureau uses its internally developed geographic update system to enhance and modify spatial and attribute data in the Census MAF/TIGER database.  Standard geographic codes, such as FIPS codes for states, counties, municipalities, county subdivisions, places, American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian areas, and congressional districts are used when encoding spatial entities.  The Census Bureau performed spatial data tests for logical consistency of the codes during the compilation of the original Census MAF/TIGER database files.  Most of the codes for geographic entities except states, counties, urban areas, Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs), American Indian Areas (AIAs), and congressional districts were provided to the Census Bureau by the                              USGS, the agency responsible for maintaining FIPS 55.  Feature attribute information has been examined but has not been fully tested for consistency. For the TIGER/Line Shapefiles, the Point and Vector Object Count for the G-polygon SDTS Point and Vector Object Type reflects the number of records in the shapefile attribute table.  For multi-polygon features, only one attribute record exists for each multi-polygon rather than one attribute record per individual G-polygon component of the multi-polygon feature.  TIGER/Line Shapefile multi-polygons are an exception to the G-polygon object type classification.  Therefore, when multi-polygons exist in a shapefile, the object count will be less than the actual number of G-polygons.   </logic>     <complete>Data completeness of the TIGER/Line Shapefiles reflects the contents of the Census MAF/TIGER database at the time the TIGER/Line Shapefiles were created.</complete>     <lineage>       <srcinfo>         <srccite>           <citeinfo>             <origin>U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau, Geography Division</origin>             <pubdate>Unpublished material</pubdate>             <title>Census MAF/TIGER database</title>           </citeinfo>         </srccite>         <srcscale>100000</srcscale>         <srctime>           <timeinfo>             <rngdates>               <begdate>201001</begdate>               <enddate>201007</enddate>             </rngdates>           </timeinfo>         </srctime>       </srcinfo>       <procstep>         <procdesc>TIGER/Line Shapefiles are extracted from the Census MAF/TIGER database by nation, state, county, and entity.
