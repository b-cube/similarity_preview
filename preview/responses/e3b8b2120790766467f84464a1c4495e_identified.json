Al-Zaki was very happy and went back to tell the Khalifa that the Shilluk people accepted the Islam and will pay taxes. King Yor did not order the Shilluk to become muslims but to be ready to fight the Mahdists when they come back in the following year. Al-Zaki came back and the Shilluk fought with him. He killed many people because he had guns. The fighting started in Kodok. Some of the Shilluk villages did not fight well, so the Shilluk king was pushed to the south until he reached Tonga. This song is telling how some villages conspired with the enemy to kill the people of Dibalo, which is part of Nyibanyo, within the Tonga cluster of villages. The conspiring villages sent a message to the people of Dibalo that Al-Zaki, the Mahdist leader says that people should go to Chief Gokwec for safety. And people went to Gokwec Village. But when Al-Zaki entered that village (the village of Chief Gokwec) in March 1892, he killed all the people. King Yor Akoc surrendered after the Dibalo massacre. He was led to Kodok and was killed. Then Al-Zaki declared Kur Nyidhok, whom he brought from El-Obeid, as the Shilluk King. Then he went back to Omdurman. But he could not come back as he promised, because the British returned to the Sudan in 1896 with Horatio Kitchener as commander of the Anglo-Egyptian army. He defeated the Mahdists in the battle of Karari on September 2, 1898. After Al-Zaki\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds departure, the elders took prince Kur to the river and ordered him to take bath.

Dh\\ufffd\\ufffdgalal young men first won the heart of Akw\\ufffd\\ufffdl Nyanyijak, the leader of the girls. They told her that they will compose many songs and dance to the rhythmic beats of drum with their full energy. And that the group has leg bells that make music that is like the noise made by birds. Dh\\ufffd\\ufffdgalal won the girls. The magic of the other group did work. So, in this song, both the young men and the girls made fun of them, saying that their magic has become rotten like a rope, and that they were as dirty as the Hadandawa. </summary> <dc:date>2014-10-29T15:41:37Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>AndrewWanhMayik_songYouWouldHaveBeenMarried</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/640\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/640</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:35Z</updated> <published>2014-10-29T15:34:28Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">AndrewWanhMayik_songYouWouldHaveBeenMarried The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk song.

They can also seek to win girls from another village if they outnumber the girls with whom they dance. The young men must first try to win the leader of the girls, who will talk to the girls and convince them to accept the young men as their dancing mates. In this song, the leader of the girls accepted to dance with Dh\\ufffd\\ufffdgalal youth, because she thought that she would be married. But she did not satisfy the young men; the result was this insulting song which says to the girl: our rich family would have married you, but we are sorry.

The composer of this song is Amon Tuk Kaal, from Oryang Village, in Mwomo District in the far north. He he was jailed by the Chief of Mwomo for burning the grass in Mwomo plains and dividing it among the people who wanted to cultivate, including non-Shilluks.  And when King Kur (1951-1974) went to Mwomo on a visit,Tuk Kaal presented his case in a song which he called Ogwal \\ufffd\\ufffdmag yi Ogwal, which means A Frog Caught A Frog\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd [NB That song is also part of the Collection of Shilluk narratives and songs, performed by Owacci Obwonyo Anay.] The King then released him. Tuk Kaal did not stay in his village after he was released. He was afraid of the chief. So, he went to live in Melut, on the eastern side of the Nile. There in Melut, he became a Muslim. Tuk Kaal was a composer, and his song, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdogwal \\ufffd\\ufffdmag yi ogwal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd made him very popular indeed, because he was encouraging agriculture. [NB That song is also part of the Collection of Shilluk narratives and songs, performed by Owacci Obwonyo Anay - http://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/543.] He made a mistake by becoming a Muslim. When one becomes a Muslim, he/she must change his/her way of life, and be dressed in jalabia. The composer in this song is urging the Shilluks not to wear the law\\ufffd\\ufffd, especially the '\\ufffd\\ufffdwaangkaaj\\ufffd\\ufffd'.  '\\ufffd\\ufffdwaangkaaj\\ufffd\\ufffd'  is a (law\\ufffd\\ufffd) cloth worn on the shoulder but it is not big enough to cover the whole body. Shilluk people fought with the Arab Muslims for a long time because they do not accept Islam. Shilluk even consider a circumcised person as defiled. Tuk Kaal became a caller (the man who shouts calling Muslims for prayers) but he failed to convert any Shilluk man to Islam. He made a sharp turn from good to worse. The Shilluk people did not forgive him although he composed songs in which he says that it was a mistake for him to accept circumcision. </summary> <dc:date>2014-10-13T12:14:06Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForKingKur3</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/638\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/638</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:35Z</updated> <published>2014-10-08T10:57:51Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForKingKur3 The recording at the center of this item is a Shilluk funeral song.

There is no term for the word sickness or illness in Shilluk. That is because long ago, people look for causes of illness. Diarrhoea and flu have names. Diarrhoea is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdth\\ufffd\\ufffdwi c\\ufffd\\ufffdn/death of intestines\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and flu is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdngong\\ufffd\\ufffd.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd  For the other illness like dysentery or fever, they think that the person is bewitched. So, if an ordinary person is ill, it is said that his/her body is painful, if it were not diarrhoea or flu. But if the person is a king, chief or elder, people say he/she has flu, even if there is no real flu. That is because people think that such people can\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdt be bewitched. When Christianity came to the land, people stopped accusing witchcraft and say that there is something unknown in the body. The word for the un-known is \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdjw\\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. So, people say \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdree da jw\\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd he/she has something un-known in his/her body. At present, sick people are taken to hospitals, where every disease has a name. But \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdjw\\ufffd\\ufffdg\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is used for sickness in general. When a person is sick for a long time it is called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdbud\\ufffd\\ufffd/lying down\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd like in this story. Maria was sick for a long time. She was shocked by the thing that she saw in the farm. That was the cause of her illness, which was followed by the itchy rash.

Cultivation (agriculture) is a major activity for the Shilluk people. Almost all the Shilluk land is fertile with good rain fall. Villagers do primitive farming using very simple hand tools. They produce a small amount of dura that is sometimes less than what they need. Only a few people produce more than what they need and exchange it for cows. Shilluk cultivate three types of dura: 1. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLwall\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd red dura which is cultivated near the village. It takes three months to ripen. So, people start eating it in August.  The new grain, once dry, is planted in its turn, yielding a harvest in December. So, some people cultivate the red dura twice a year. In some areas, red dura and maize are now cultivated far inland because the children who would look after the cows go to schools. 2. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdThur\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd brown dura is cultivated in the forest. It is harvested in October. 3. \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgono\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd yellow dura is cultivated far from the village. It ripens very late in December.

The Shilluk Kingdom has no particular flag that stands as its symbol. But each village has its flag. In one village, there can be a flag for men and another for women of the same age-group. Older flags are also displayed in big occasions. This song implies that the women of Obay Aboj\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdb\\ufffd\\ufffd were not pleased with their flag.  So, they said to their leader that the flag must be changed at the end of the year. At the end of that year, they brought a flag from Egypt. The flag from Egypt was good and they liked it. After getting a beautiful flag, they want to pay homage to the King in his village, \\ufffd\\ufffdl\\ufffd\\ufffdki. And because the women were not happy before, they must be reconciled.

Wijrek had no paramount chief before King Ayang. They kept complaining that they should not be part of Pachodo area in \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdG\\ufffd\\ufffdr\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, because G\\ufffd\\ufffdr is too big and they are even far from Pachodo. King Ayang in 1978 upgraded Wijrek and appointed a paramount chief for it. In the song, this is expressed as that Wijrek \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfound a gourd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The gourd is a literally container. But when you give somebody something to eat, it is said that you gave him a gourd, that is food. This image relates to the fact that paramount chiefs share wealth in Pachodo, that means they have the right to recommend anybody from their area for support from \"bwori mac\", the common wealth. And also when a king gives, people say Nyikango gave. King Ayang appointed a paramount chief for Wijrek, so they became a district and not part of Pachodo anymore; now they have their rights and duties. In this song, the composer who is also from Wijrek is thanking King Ayang for upgrading Wijrek into a district. And he says that those who think Wijrek is weak are wrong. Wijrek is independent and strong. Lwak means \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmultitude\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, but also refers to the region Wijrek feels associated with (rather than G\\ufffd\\ufffdr). </summary> <dc:date>2014-05-19T16:37:42Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForAmaylek</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/551\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/551</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:35Z</updated> <published>2014-05-19T16:15:07Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForAmaylek The recording at the center of this item is a funeral song.

Moreover, Padhyang had a farm for King Ayang Anay. In this song, the composer asks King Ayang to bring back those who left their villages and put them in prison, because the shrines are falling down. Then he challenges the people of Pachodo area; he says that King Ayang is a glorious king but you, the people of Pachodo area, you are lazy. You just sit by his side and you are not cultivating.

When people become tired of dancing keb, they sit down in a wide circle and amagag begins. In amagag people clap their hands as they sing. And a number of girls go to choose the men to dance with in the circle. When they are tired, they come and sit, and a new group goes to dance. When amagag songs are finished or the people are tired, they disperse. In this song, the composer is encouraging his group of Padhyang Village to go and look for girls with whom they will dance, after they lost their dancing mates. He blames some people from their group who do not dance well for the lost dancing mates. They were accepted by the girls of Alwiy in Lul area. Lul is far from Padhyang, the villages between Padhyang and Lul to the south are: Golbangyo, Nyigir, Pachodo and Kwom. The composer and his friend think that they made it because they are handsome with perfect white teeth, and they are educated. They are also feeling proud because they did not use any witchcraft for that purpose. </summary> <dc:date>2014-05-19T15:59:27Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>MariaBocayOnak_War</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/545\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/545</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:35Z</updated> <published>2014-04-30T15:10:22Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">MariaBocayOnak_War In this narrative, Maria Bocay Onak tells about what she experienced during the fighting in Malakal at the of December 2013 and early 2014, and how she came with her children to Juba. Violence erupted in South Sudan in the capital, Juba, on 15 December 2013, between soldiers loyal to President Kiir against soldiers loyal to Riek Machar, the former vice president. The reason was that Kiir ordered to disarm the Nuers at the Presidential guards. It reached the Shilluk Land on 21 December; soldiers loyal to Riek fought with those loyal to Kiir in Owacci. And the wounded soldiers were brought to Malakal on 23 December. And when people saw them, they were afraid and ran from the market to their homes. On 24 December 2013, rebels attacked Malakal at 05:00 am, and fighting continued until the rebels captured the army HQ on the second day. Many people were killed, shops and houses were looted. But fighting continued for five days in the Southern and Northern Sectors. Then the rebels captured the whole town. Reinforcements came from Renk and Melut Counties on the second week, and the government troops chased away the rebels. But they came back after a month. The second fighting was terrible for the civilians and people fled from the town with many killed, and a big number drowned in the Nile. NB Malakal  is a distorted name for the village that was founded by King Akw\\ufffd\\ufffdt (1825-1835). Its name was ''Mal ba Kaal''.  Mal means on earth and kaal is a temporal dwelling. And home is the village of God which Shilluk believe is under the earth.

The first way is called surrounding. In surrounding, women go to the river that has shallow water; they prefer rivers that are covered with reeds. When they reach the river, they take off their clothes and put on loin-clothes brought specially for surrounding fish. They stand in a line and make a circle around the place they want to search for fish. Then they sit in the water and close in, searching for fish and catching them with their hands.  When fish is finished in the place, they go and surround another place until they have enough fish. And then, they go home in the evening. The other two ways of women fishing are: kicking the fish, pulling out by hook and throwing hooks into the middle of river. Women use hooks with baits. In general, fishing is a major economic activity to the Shilluk people. Fishing is done mainly in the dry season, after people have gathered in their crops. It is done in the small rivers that may have parts covered with reeds. Men use fishing spears for fishing in the parts that are covered with reeds. And they use nets and fishing harpoons for fishing in the open parts that are not covered by reeds. While in the Nile they follow the nets as they are carried by the water current. Detailed information about fishing by men can be found in JwokpapyejGay_FishingPart1 and in JwokpapyejGay_FishingPart2. </summary> <dc:date>2014-04-17T16:28:53Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForMaybek</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10283/539\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name/> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/10283/539</id> <updated>2015-02-23T10:53:35Z</updated> <published>2014-03-18T11:26:32Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">OttoGwadoAyoker_songFuneralSongForMaybek The recording at the center of this item is a funeral song.
