PatekDepartment of Biology, Duke University, Box 90338, Durham, NC 27708, USAe-mail: philip.anderson{at}duke.eduAbstract A classic question in evolutionary biology is how form\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfunction relationships promote or limit diversification. Mechanical metrics, such as kinematic transmission (KT) in linkage systems, are useful tools for examining the evolution of form and function in a comparative context. The convergence of disparate systems on equivalent metric values (mechanical equivalence) has been highlighted as a source of potential morphological diversity under the assumption that morphology can evolve with minimal impact on function. However, this assumption does not account for mechanical sensitivity\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe sensitivity of the metric to morphological changes in individual components of a structure. We examined the diversification of a four-bar linkage system in mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda), and found evidence for both mechanical equivalence and differential mechanical sensitivity. KT exhibited variable correlations with individual linkage components, highlighting the components that influence KT evolution, and the components that are free to evolve independently from KT and thereby contribute to the observed pattern of mechanical equivalence. Determining the mechanical sensitivity in a system leads to a deeper understanding of both functional convergence and morphological diversification. This study illustrates the importance of multi-level analyses in delineating the factors that limit and promote diversification in form\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfunction systems. evolutionbiomechanicsmechanical sensitivitymechanical equivalenceReceived December 19, 2014.Accepted January 27, 2015.\\ufffd\\ufffd 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.
