These data were generated in  order to apply events data to the study of the emergence and  processing of political issues in the United States and to test a  number of hypotheses regarding the types of events associated with  various political issues. Approximately 4,600 cases are events in  which an actor attempts to influence a target. The remaining cases are  reports of press items such as editorials and columns. The data  include: (1) whether it was a political event (i.e., one in which an  actor directs some action toward a target in a political system in  order to influence the behavior of the target) or a press item (i.e.,  information about the domestic issue from either a newspaper column or  a newspaper editorial), (2) the domestic issue (one of 40 possible  categories), (3) the domestic subissue, (4) the date and the page of  the newspaper in which the article describing the event was found, (5)  the press treatment or coverage of the event, (6) the actor initiating  the event (coded in one of 100 categories including both governmental  and nongovernmental actors), (7) the federal role favored by the actor  regarding the issue, (8) whether the actor specialized in dealing with  the issue, (9) type of action initiated by the actor, (10) the mode of  action, (11) the target of the event, and (12) the weight of the event or press item.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1968\" cycle=\"P1\">1968</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1972\" cycle=\"P1\">1972</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>United States domestic events of national importance in 1968-1972.</universe>                      <dataKind>event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Both random and systematic probability sampling was  used. The events sampled concerned 40 domestic United States political  issues. Twenty of those 40 were designated as major political issues  and 20 were deemed minor political issues. To choose major political  issues, the investigator examined the responses to a question in the  November 1970 Harris Poll, which asked, \"What are the top two or three  problems facing people such as yourself you would like to see the new  Congress do something about?\" The 20 issues that elicited the most  responses were regarded as the major domestic political issues. THE  NEW YORK TIMES was the basic source for the major political issues due  to its reputation for accuracy and its function as an information  source to elites. Using the NEW YORK TIMES INDEX, approximately 50  entries for each issue area were coded per year. To simplify the  sampling process, systematic rather than random sampling was used. In  order to find a sample of minor issues, the \"Table of Contents\" of the  1970 CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY ALMANAC, which was a relatively complete  list of the issues considered in the political system that year, was  used. A random sample of domestic issues was chosen from that  list. Those which duplicated the major issues were deleted. The  resulting data were weighted to approximate the total number of events  pertaining to that issue in the INDEX. The weights (N18) equalize the  data, making estimation of the characteristics of the whole population of reported events and press items possible.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          THE NEW YORK TIMES and CONGRESSIONAL QUARTERLY ALMANAC             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 The codebook is provided by ICPSR as a Portable  Document Format (PDF) file.
