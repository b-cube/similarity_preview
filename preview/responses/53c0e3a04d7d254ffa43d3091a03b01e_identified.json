The gridded datasets consist of 28 precipitation-frequency grids, a mean annual precipitation grid,  eight land cover grids, two soil permeability grids, a synthetic stream grid, and a region grid used in the Hawaii StreamStats application for peak flow estimates. The personal geodatabase contains a polygon feature class of exclusion polygons, which identify areas in which use the StreamStats application is restricted. </abstract>    <purpose>  These datasets were produced to support the StreamStats application for Hawaii.  The precipitation, land cover, and soil permeability grids are used to compute  those characteristics for basins that have been edited by the user within the  StreamStats web application. The same grids were used to compute continuous  parameter grids. The continuous parameter grids are distributed with the ArcHydroHUC  data sets for each 8-digit HUC, and are used in characteristic computations for unedited basins.  The region grid is used to identify which regional regression equations to apply  for estimating streamflow statistics in Hawaii. The exclusion polygons are used to  restrict or prevent use of the StreamStats application in areas where results may be  invalid, or where its use is to be prevented for various reasons. </purpose>    <supplinf> Each compressed download  file (with a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd extension) contains the  version information in the filename in the form of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdVnn,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd where \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd  is the data version number. In this manner, each data component may be  versioned and distributed independently. The data is distributed in  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd files, one per 8-digit HUC, plus one \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd file for the  ArcHydro Global dataset, one for the statewide layers, and one for the  original data. For example, the file \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDS680_20020000_V01.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd would  contain the entire folder for HUC 20020000 (Maui). A file named  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDS680_20020000_V02.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd would indicate that data have been updated,  and that version 02 data should be used. If a change to one dataset  results in the need to change others, all affected datasets will be  updated, and the data distribution site will be maintained so it  includes a complete set of compatible dataset versions.  Each \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd file includes a text file (like this one) that indicates  the version of the accompanying data component. For example, the  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDS680_20020000_V02.zip\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd file would contain a file named  \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdDS680_20020000_V02.txt,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which will extract into the archydro\\\\20020000  folder. The name of this file will indicate the version of the data in  the folder. The file itself contains an explanation of the versioning  system, and a summary of edits made since the first version of the  dataset was released.  To replace an old version with a newer version, the old version of the data component should be deleted, following the example below, before the new version is extracted into its place.   Example instructions for updating data components from geospatial datasets:  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Component           Delete prior to extracting new version of \".zip\" file --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ArcHydroGlobal      D:\\\\data\\\\hi_ss\\\\archydro\\\\global.mdb StatewideLayers     D:\\\\data\\\\hi_ss\\\\statewide\\\\ (delete entire folder) Huc#                D:\\\\data\\\\hi_ss\\\\archydro\\\\Huc# (delete entire folder) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  where HUC# is the 8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code and D:\\\\data\\\\hi_ss\\\\ is the disk  location where ZIP file archives were extracted. </supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <sngdate>      <caldate>2012</caldate>     </sngdate>    </timeinfo>    <current>publication date</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>None planned</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-159.789288</westbc>     <eastbc>-154.732099</eastbc>     <northbc>22.233206</northbc>     <southbc>18.893342</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>inlandWaters</themekey>     <themekey>streamflow statistics</themekey>     <themekey>streamstats</themekey>     <themekey>forest</themekey>     <themekey>land cover</themekey>     <themekey>slope</themekey>     <themekey>elevation</themekey>     <themekey>aspect</themekey>     <themekey>precipitation</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>GCMD Location Keywords</placekt>     <placekey>NORTH AMERICA</placekey>     <placekey>UNITED STATES</placekey>     <placekey>UNITED STATES OF AMERICA</placekey>     <placekey>Hawaii</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>None</useconst>   <ptcontac>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>     </cntorgp>     <cntpos>Alan Rea</cntpos>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>      <address>230 Collins Road</address>      <city>Boise</city>      <state>ID</state>      <postal>83702</postal>      <country>USA</country>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>208-387-1323</cntvoice>     <cntemail>ahrea@usgs.gov</cntemail>    </cntinfo>   </ptcontac>   <browse>    <browsen>http://water.usgs.gov/GIS/browse/ds680_statewidelayers.jpg</browsen>    <browsed>Compilation representation of the data set.</browsed>    <browset>jpg</browset>   </browse>   <native>Microsoft Windows Vista Version 6.1 (Build 7600) ; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.4000</native>  </idinfo>  <dataqual>   <logic>None</logic>   <complete>Complete for the islands of Hawaii, Maui, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai.
