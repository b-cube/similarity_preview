An acceptability judgment task, a discourse-completion task and an interpretation task were used in the study, and the results indicate that in Chinese speakers\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd L2 English, the form of wh-on-earth can be learned and stored in a native-like manner, but without being endowed with fully elaborated features. A distinction between active features and dormant features in L2 lexicon is made in the analysis, and it is argued that features transferred from learners\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd L1 to their L2 are likely to lose their vigour and vitality in their L2 lexicon and become dormant if there is no evidence in the target language input to confirm or disconfirm them. A typical consequence of a dormant feature is random behaviours of a related structure in L2 learners\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd production and interpretation. The results of the study show that semantic features, discourse features as well as morphosyntactic features can become dormant in L2 lexicon. This is the accepted manuscript.

Rule-guided drinking was part of social life, but, importantly, it was also a corner stone in sacrificial ritual and therefore an important measure to please the spirit world. In assessing the past, early Chinese writers often judged rulers and their regimes based on the way they handled alcohol and ritualized drinking. Moderation or excess in drinking was seen as a key indicator in a regime\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds health: bad and overindulgent rulers were pitched against sages, who were portrayed as masters in the art of moderate consumption. These judgements run as a red thread through the written record, from Zhou bronze inscriptions to Han memorials. This is the accepted manuscript.

Moralising readings of animal behaviour proliferate in texts and iconography from the classical age of the Warring States and early empires (5th cent BC-1st cent AD), when China\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds masters of philosophy were drawing up the contours of their ethical theories. The animal world inspired models for human ritualised conduct that became codified in the classicist (Confucian) ritual canon. This paper examines representative examples of this and tries to identify some of the conceptual schemes used in early China to subsume the animal world into moral frameworks that were meant to guide human conduct. This is the accepted manuscript. It's currently embargoed pending publication of the final version by Brill. </summary> <dc:date>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>The Ottoman Press, 1908-1923</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245088\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Baykal, Erol Adnan Ferdi</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/245088</id> <updated>2013-12-18T14:40:49Z</updated> <published>2013-06-11T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">The Ottoman Press, 1908-1923 Baykal, Erol Adnan Ferdi </summary> <dc:date>2013-06-11T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
