No facilities are available with large fetches and correspondingly high wave ages. Furthermore almost no large facility is suitable for measurements with sea water,&lt;br /&gt;     is clean enough for controllable experiments with surface films or sufficiently&lt;br /&gt;     gastight for gas exchange measurements. Currently a new large annular wind/wave facility with quasi unlimited fetch is under construction at the Institute for Environmental Physics of Heidelberg University. An annular facility is not a new idea. A 40 m diameter facility (&amp;ldquo;storm basin&amp;rdquo;) was already built shortly after World War II in Sevastopol for wind/wave interaction studies. Various small circular facilities for air-sea gas exchange studies have been used since the late 70ties at Heidelberg University and later at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for air-sea gas exchange studies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>     </record>      </records> </xml>",
