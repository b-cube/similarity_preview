Data were collected from four trial sites in the UK in May 2012. The trial sites comprised of 20 varieties (plots) replicated in three blocks on each farm but only 2 of the blocks at each site were used for pollinator observations. Pollinator observations were also only made where there were greater than 30 percent of OSR plants in flower in the plot and only when weather conditions were within standardised limits. For each plot per site a six minute observation period was made during which the number of pollinators within the following taxon groups were counted: bumblebees to the species level, solitary bees identified to general body forms (Lasiglossum to genus level; Osmia separated to bicolour and rufa; Andrena separated to body forms typical of dorsata, carantonica, nigroaenea, haemorrhoa, fulva, flavipies, nitida, cineraria, bicolour and minuta), large hoverflies (&gt; 12 mm), small hoverflies (&lt; 11 mm), and Bibionidae. Each variety was observed for two separate six minute periods to reduce the impacts of minor fluctuations in weather that may reduce pollinator observations within single six minute periods. The dataset was collected as part of a project which aimed to identify key pollinators for OSR and identify if there are feeding preferences for individual varieties.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pollinators</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bumblebees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>solitary bees</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>hoverflies</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Bibionidae</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>oilseed rape</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oxfordshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cambridgeshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Lincolnshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Suffolk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-05T09:49:53Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a5093d15-be48-48de-b8fd-41f573cf2b10\">     <title>Farm scale evaluations of herbicide tolerant genetically modified crops - farm management data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/a5093d15-be48-48de-b8fd-41f573cf2b10</link>     <description>This dataset consists of farm management data which includes crop drilling dates and herbicide application dates. The data relate to arable fields in which a range of ecological measurements were collected, including species counts in the following areas: weed seedbank, vegetation in the crop, field edge vegetation, invertebrates. Each field was sown with a combination of genetically modified and conventional crops, either Beet, Maize, Spring-sown Oilseed Rape or Winter-sown oilseed Rape. The data were collected as part of the Farm Scale Evaluations (FSEs), a four-year programme of research by independent researchers aimed at studying the effect that the management practices associated with Genetically Modified Herbicide Tolerant (GMHT) crops might have on farmland wildlife, when compared with weed control used with non-GM crops.
