Although&#13; thread-level speculation can avoid the need for precise&#13; dependence analysis, communication overheads required to synchronize&#13; actual dependences counteract the benefits of parallelization.&#13; To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight&#13; architectural enhancement co-designed with a parallelizing compiler,&#13; which together can decouple communication from thread&#13; execution. Simulations of these approaches, applied to a processor&#13; with 16 Intel Atom-like cores, show an average of 6.85 &#13; performance speedup for six SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks.

In&#13; particular, they are often found lacking in pretend play during early childhood. Researchers believe that they encounter difficulty&#13; in generating and maintaining mental representation of pretense coupled with the immediate reality. We have developed an&#13; interactive system that explores the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to visually conceptualize the representation&#13; of pretense within an open-ended play environment. Results from an empirical study involving children with ASC aged 4 to 7&#13; demonstrated a significant improvement of pretend play in terms of frequency, duration and relevance using the AR system&#13; in comparison to a non computer-assisted situation. We investigated individual differences, skill transfer, system usability and&#13; limitations of the proposed AR system. We discuss design guidelines for future AR systems for children with ASC and other&#13; pervasive developmental disorders. This is the accepted manuscript. It is currently under infinite embargo pending publication. </description> <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246727\"> <title>A Crime Script Analysis of the Online Stolen Data Market</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246727</link> <description>A Crime Script Analysis of the Online Stolen Data Market Hutchings, Alice; Holt, Thomas J. The purpose of this study is to better understand the online black market economy, specifically&#13; relating to stolen data, using crime script analysis. Content analysis of 13 English- and Russianspeaking&#13; stolen data forums found that the different products and services offered enabled the commodification&#13; of stolen data. The marketplace offers a range of complementary products, from the&#13; supply of hardware and software to steal data, the sale of the stolen data itself, to the provision of&#13; services to turn data into money, such as drops, cashiers and money laundering. The crime script&#13; analysis provides some insight into how the actors in these forums interact, and the actions they&#13; perform, from setting up software to finalizing transactions and exiting the marketplace. </description> <dc:date>2014-12-09T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246704\"> <title>Feature-based Terrain Editing From Complex Sketches</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246704</link> <description>Feature-based Terrain Editing From Complex Sketches Tasse, Flora Ponjou; Emilien, Arnaud; Cani, Marie-Paule; Hahmann, Stefanie; Dodgson, Neil We present a new method for first person sketch-based editing of terrain models. As in usual artistic pictures, the input sketch&#13; depicts complex silhouettes with cusps and T-junctions, which typically correspond to non-planar curves in 3D. After analysing&#13; depth constraints in the sketch based on perceptual cues, our method best matches the sketched silhouettes with silhouettes or ridges&#13; of the input terrain. A deformation algorithm is then applied to the terrain, enabling it to exactly match the sketch from the given&#13; perspective view, while insuring that none of the user-defined silhouettes is hidden by another part of the terrain. We extend this&#13; sketch-based terrain editing framework to handle a collection of multi-view sketches. As our results show, this method enables&#13; users to easily personalize an existing terrain, while preserving its plausibility and style. This is the accepted manuscript.
