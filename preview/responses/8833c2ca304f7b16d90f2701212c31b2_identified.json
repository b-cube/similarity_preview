This spatial dataset is intended for general planning and mapping purposes rather than for deriving density estimates. The geodatabase is comprised of two feature classes (observations and survey_poly) and two tables (incidental_attributes and reference_information).</abstract> <purpose>The Arctic LCC and USFWS Fairbanks Fish &amp; Wildlife Field Office partnered with BLM to create the Yellow-billed Loon Geodatabase.  This database is intended to be a qualitative \"first look\" at where loons have been recorded and where surveys have been conducted.  This dataset is intended for general planning and mapping purposes, it should NOT be used for deriving density estimates.  Users are reminded that these data do not represent all locations within the geographic scope of this database that may be occupied by loons.</purpose> <supplinf>Observations of YBLOs are considered to have been derived from a survey if both of the following conditions are met 1) there was a search area with reasonably well-defined boundaries, and 2) YBLOs were among the taxa specifically targeted by the survey.  All observations of YBLOs that do not meet these criteria are treated as incidental observations - these could include observations contributed by persons engaged in activities other than wildlife surveys, observations obtained during the course of biological survey work targeted at another species such as caribou, and historical observations from the literature.  Incidental observations are assigned the non-unique value \"Incidental\" in the SURVEY_ID field and are related to the incidental_attributes table via a unique value in the Incd_ID field. This database should NOT be used to estimate densities. It is a qualitative \"first look\" at where surveys have been conducted and where YBLOs have been recorded, rather than an uniformly rigorous quantification of survey effort. While some survey polygons are very accurate, others are generalized and noted as such. Not all survey polygons have associated observations. This is because some polygons are associated with null results (i.e., no loons seen on the survey). The inclusion of null survey polygons is incomplete at this stage.</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <rngdates> <begdate>1831</begdate> <enddate>2013</enddate> </rngdates> </timeinfo> <current>ground condition</current> </timeperd> <status> <progress>Complete</progress> <update>As needed</update> </status> <spdom> <bounding> <westbc>-173</westbc> <eastbc>-78</eastbc> <northbc>74</northbc> <southbc>52</southbc> </bounding> </spdom> <keywords> <theme> <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt> <themekey>biota</themekey> </theme> <theme> <themekt>User</themekt> <themekey>loon</themekey> <themekey>Yellow-billed loon</themekey> <themekey>YBLO</themekey> <themekey>survey</themekey> <themekey>yellow-billed loon observations</themekey> <themekey>incidental observations</themekey> </theme> <place> <placekt>None</placekt> <placekey>Alaska</placekey> <placekey>Canada</placekey> <placekey>Northern Alaska</placekey> <placekey>Northern Canada</placekey> </place> </keywords> <accconst>None.</accconst> <useconst>Neither the Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, BLM, USFWS, or contributors to this dataset shall be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein.  In an effort to provide the most comprehensive overview possible, we have incorporated many data sources, representing many different survey methods.  It is not possible to apply a uniform quantification of survey effort across this wide variety of data sets because not all of the yellow-billed loons observations are associated with a clearly defined survey area.  Therefore, the user should avoid aggregating data from multiple sources to derive density estimates.  When interpreting these data, users are reminded to consider that detectability of loons is a function of many variables, including differences in species, habitat, time-of-year, weather conditions, and survey techniques. Inherent in any data set used to develop graphical representations, are limitations of accuracy as determined by, among others, the source, scale and resolution of the data.</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative</cntorg> </cntorgp> <cntpos>Geospatial Specialist</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype> <address>101 12th Ave, Rm 110</address> <city>Fairbanks</city> <state>Alaska</state> <postal>99701</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>907 456 0327</cntvoice> <cntemail>data@arcticlcc.org</cntemail> <cntinst>Contact by phone or email.</cntinst> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <datacred>Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative, Bureau of Land Management Arctic Field Office, and USFWS Fairbanks Fish &amp; Wildlife Field Office.</datacred> <secinfo> <secsys>FIPS Pub 199</secsys> <secclass>No Confidentiality</secclass> <sechandl>Standard Technical Controls</sechandl> </secinfo> </idinfo> <dataqual> <logic>Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative (Arctic LCC) and USFWS Fairbanks Fish &amp; Wildlife Field Office staff have compiled this dataset to the best of their abilities using the resources available to them.
