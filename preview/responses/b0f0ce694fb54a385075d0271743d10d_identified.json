Because of the urgency of the mission, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> personally provided all the equipment for the ship and lavish salary for the crew.  He also paid the troops that were with him because the general on board did not have sufficient funds.</p>  <p>After reaching his destination, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> sent his rowers to search for other employment while he waited for <name type=\"person\">Polycles</name> to take over the ship, since his own the term of service as trierarch had expired.  <name type=\"person\">Polycles</name> never arrived, and in the meantime, the Athenian <xref type=\"xref\" n=\"Assembly\">Assembly</xref> ordered <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> to convey the general <name type=\"person\">Menon</name> to the <placeName key=\"Hellespont\">Hellespont</placeName>.  <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> had to hire another crew of sailors, which required him to mortgage his farm.</p>  <p><name type=\"person\">Polycles</name> was not at the <placeName key=\"Hellespont\">Hellespont</placeName> to relieve <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>. Nevertheless, the Athenian general <name type=\"person\">Timomachus</name> ordered <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> to to deliver desperately needed to <placeName key=\"Hieron\">Hieron</placeName>.  <name type=\"person\">Timomachus</name> could not pay <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>, and there were no other trierarchs to offset the expenses, so Apollodorus had to take out another loan to provide the money.  In the meantime, <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>&#8217; father-in-law spotted <name type=\"person\">Polycles</name> in the market at <placeName key=\"Athens\">Athens</placeName> and urged him to finish his appointed duty and to reimburse <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name> for all of his expenses.  <name type=\"person\">Polycles</name> refused either to assume the trierarchy or to give any financial assistance to <name type=\"person\">Apollodorus</name>.</p>  <p>The speech was more likely given around <date value=\"-359\">359 BCE</date> (source for date: <bibl>A.T. Murray, <title>Demosthenes L</title> [Cambridge, Mass.; Loeb Classical Library; 1943] 3</bibl>). </p> <byline>Hershal Pleasant</byline> </div0>    </body> </text> </TEI.2> ",
