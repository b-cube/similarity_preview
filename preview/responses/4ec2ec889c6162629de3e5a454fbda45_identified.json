Aeromagnetic and electromagnetic data were acquired for 250 sq miles during the helicopter-based survey. Data provided in GPR 2008-1 include processed (1) linedata ASCII database, (2) gridded files of magnetic data, a calculated vertical magnetic gradient (first vertical derivative), apparent resistivity data, and a digital elevation model, (3) vector files of data contours and flight lines, and (4) the Contractor&apos;s descriptive project report. Data are described in more detail in the &quot;GPR2008-1Readme.pdf&quot; and &quot;linedata/GPR2008-1-Linedata.txt&quot; files included on the DVD. </abstract> <purpose>The survey was funded by the U.S. Department of Interior, Bureau of Land Management in support of the State of Alaska&apos;s Airborne Geophysical/Geological Mineral Inventory project. The data were produced to provide information for mineral resource evaluation and land management decisions.</purpose> <supplinf> The maps were compiled and drawn under contract between the State of Alaska, Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological &amp; Geophysical Surveys (DGGS), and Stevens Exploration Management Corp.

The HMSL (or GPS-Z) value is primarily dependent on the number of available satellites. Although post-processing of GPS data will yield X and Y accuracies in the order of 5 meters, the accuracy of the Z value is usually much less, sometimes in the +/-20 meter range.</vertaccr> </vertacc> </posacc> <lineage> <srcinfo> <srccite> <citeinfo> <origin>Akima, H.</origin> <pubdate>1970</pubdate> <title>A new method of interpolation and smooth curve fitting based on local procedures</title> <serinfo> <sername>Journal of the Association of Computing Machinery</sername> <issue>v. 7, no. 4</issue> </serinfo> <onlink>None</onlink> </citeinfo> </srccite> <typesrc>paper</typesrc> <srctime> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1970</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <srccurr>1970</srccurr> </srctime> <srccitea>Akima, 1970</srccitea> <srccontr>Fugro Airborne Surveys used a modification of this method while making grids.</srccontr> </srcinfo> <procstep> <procdesc>The Alaskan section grid, taken from the DGGS network, was modified by DGGS to align some of the section lines with the section lines on the U.S. Geological Survey 1:63,360-scale topographic maps of the area. Modification involved moving about an eighth or less of the east-west and north-south lines, particularly in the western portions of the quadrangle sheets. Movement was generally on the order of a tenth of a mile. The section grid file contained here may not be identical to the section grid available through Alaska Department of Natural Resources, Land Record Information Section (LRIS).</procdesc> <procdate>2007</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>The airborne geophysical data were acquired with a DIGHEM(V) Electromagnetic (EM) system and a Fugro D1344 cesium magnetometer with a Scintrex CS3 cesium censor. The EM and magnetic sensors were flown at a height of 100 feet. In addition, the survey recorded data from a radar altimeter, GPS navigation system, 50/60 Hz monitors, and video camera. Flights were performed with an AS350B-3 Squirrel helicopter at a mean terrain clearance of 200 feet along N-S survey flight lines with one-quarter mile line spacing. Tie lines were flown perpendicular to the flight lines at intervals of approximately 3 miles. A Novatel OEM4 Global Positioning System was used for navigation and flight path recovery. The helicopter position was derived every 0.5 seconds using post-flight differential positioning to a relative accuracy of better than 5 m. Flight path positions were projected onto the Clarke 1866 (UTM zone 7) spheroid, 1927 North American datum using a central meridian (CM) of 141 degrees, a north constant of 0 and an east constant of 500,000.</procdesc> <procdate>2007</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> The total magnetic field data were acquired with a sampling interval of 0.1 seconds, and were (1) corrected for measured system lag, (2) corrected for diurnal variations by subtraction of the digitally recorded base station magnetic data (saved as tfmag in Fortymile-Linedata.xyz), (3) adjusted for regional variations (or IGRF gradient, 2005, updated to September 2007) using altimeter adjusted IGRF, (4) leveled to the tie line data (saved as magigrf in Fortymile-Linedata.xyz), and (5) interpolated onto a regular 80-m grid using a modified Akima (1970) technique. The total magnetic field data were subjected to a processing algorithm that enhances the response of magnetic bodies in the upper 500 m and attenuates the response of deeper bodies. The resulting vertical gradient grid (Fortymile-cvg) provides better definition and resolution of near-surface magnetic units. It also identifies weak magnetic features that may not be evident on the total field data. All magnetic grids were then resampled from the 80-m cell size down to a 25-m cell size using a modified Akima (1970) technique to produce the maps and final grids contained on this publication. </procdesc> <srcused>Akima, 1970</srcused> <procdate>2007</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>The DIGHEM V EM system measured inphase and quadrature components at five frequencies. Two vertical coaxial-coil pairs operated at 1125 (1000) and 5454 (5500) Hz while three horizontal coplanar-coil pairs operated at 875 (900), 7153 (7200), and 55,400 (56,000) Hz. The EM data were sampled at 0.1 second intervals. The EM system responds to bedrock conductors, conductive overburden, and cultural sources. The EM inphase and quadrature data were drift corrected using base level data collected at high altitude (areas of no signal). Along-line filters are applied to the data to remove spheric spikes. The data were inspected for variations in phase, and a phase correction was applied to the data if necessary. Apparent resistivities were then calculated from the inphase and quadrature data for all frequencies based on a pseudo-layer half-space model. Manual leveling of the inphase and quadrature of each coil pair, based on the resistivity data and comparisons to the data from the other frequencies, was performed. Automated micro-leveling is carried out in areas of low signal. The EM data were interpolated onto a regular 80-m grid using a modified Akima (1970) technique. The resulting grids were subjected to a 3x3 hanning filter and resampled to a 25-m cell size before contouring and map production.</procdesc> <srcused>Akima, 1970</srcused> <procdate>2007</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>To produce the digital elevation model, the GPS-Z data were differentially corrected and transformed into the local datum. The ALTBIRD data were filtered using a 13, 13 filter. Both the Z-COR (differentially corrected GPS-Z) was checked for spikes, which were removed manually.  The corrected altimeter was then subtracted from the Z-COR data to produce profiles of the height above mean sea level along the survey lines.  The data were manually leveled to remove any errors between lines. After all leveling, the data were DC shifted to match the local maps, in this case, NAD27. The final Z value is recalculated as final Z = DEM + altbird. The 80-m DEM grid was then resampled to a 25-m cell size to produce the DEM grid contained on this publication.</procdesc> <procdate>2007</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc>The included plot files of the maps were produced by Fugro Airborne Surveys. The HPGL2 files were created with HP Designjet 5000 printer driver v5.32 and will not work with all plotters, but do plot on the DGGS HP Design Jet 5000. The HPGL2 files have brighter colors and sharper topography than the Adobe Acrobat files. The Adobe Acrobat format files were created with Adobe Acrobat Distiller v7.0 (PDF 1.3) from Postscript files.
