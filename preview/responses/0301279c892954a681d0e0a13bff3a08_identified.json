Infections with one of these viruses can facilitate infection with the other. In Jamaica cervical cancer is seen in 27.5 per 100, 000 women making it the second leading cause of cancer death in this population only to breast cancer as a cause of death in women with cancer. Our study investigates the seroprevalence of anti-HIV antibodies in women with abnormal pap smears in Jamaica to determine the influence of HIV on cervical dysplasia. Only patients with positive confirmatory tests were classified as HIV positive. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used for screening while the Western blot was used for confirmation. Sero-prevalence of anti-HIV antibodies in women with abnormal pap smears was 0.85%. The preliminary results of HIV seroprevalence in women with abnormal pap smears may be low in Jamaica because of the success of the HIV/AIDS programme. A larger study can be done in the future and be representative of the Jamaica population, since the present study has as a limitation a smaller number of controls in comparison to cases. The findings reported do not support the hypothesis that HPV infection facilitates HIV infection in the studied population. It is the first study of its class reported in the Caribbean. It has been postulated that HPV infections may account for the cervical dysplasia despite the low prevalence of HIV association in the women with abnormal pap smears and that persistent HPV and to a lesser extent the HIV is responsible for the prevalence of abnormal pap smears in Jamaica. A limitation of the study was that the control group was smaller than that expected for 3 million&amp;rsquo;s population but a larger study can be done in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description><dc:publisher/><dc:date>2013-07-23</dc:date><dc:source>http://zenodo.org/record/8068</dc:source><dc:doi>10.5281/zenodo.8068</dc:doi><dc:identifier>http://zenodo.org/record/8068</dc:identifier><dc:identifier>oai:zenodo.org:8068</dc:identifier></dc:dc>   </collection>",
