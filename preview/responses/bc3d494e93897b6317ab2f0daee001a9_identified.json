The&#13; exact location of his laboratory has long been a&#13; source of conjecture and this article describes&#13; a survey undertaken to determine both the&#13; possible site of the laboratory as well as that of&#13; the rubbish pit in which Newton would have&#13; disposed of the waste materials generated in&#13; his chemical experiments. The results are&#13; believed to be of sufficient interest to justify&#13; continuation of the investigation. </summary> <dc:date>2005-07-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
