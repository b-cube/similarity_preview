<title>Recent developments in solid-state NMR spectroscopy of crystalline microporous materials</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6272</link>     <description>Abstract: Microporous materials, having pores and channels on the same size scale as small to medium molecules, have found many important applications in current technologies, including catalysis, gas separation and drug storage and delivery. Many of their properties and functions are related to their detailed local structure, such as the type and distribution of active sites within the pores, and the specific structures of these active sites. Solid-state NMR spectroscopy has a strong track record of providing the requisite detailed atomic-level insight into the structures of microporous materials, in addition to being able to probe dynamic processes occurring on timescales spanning many orders of magnitude (i.e., from s to ps). In this Perspective, we provide a brief review of some of the basic experimental approaches used in solid-state NMR spectroscopy of microporous materials, and then discuss some more recent advances in this field, particularly those applied to the study of crystalline materials such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks. These advances include improved software for aiding spectral interpretation, the development of the NMR-crystallography approach to structure determination, new routes for the synthesis of isotopically-labelled materials, methods for the characterisation of host-guest interactions, and methodologies suitable for observing NMR spectra of paramagnetic microporous materials.

Solid-state NMR spectroscopy has a strong track record of providing the requisite detailed atomic-level insight into the structures of microporous materials, in addition to being able to probe dynamic processes occurring on timescales spanning many orders of magnitude (i.e., from s to ps). In this Perspective, we provide a brief review of some of the basic experimental approaches used in solid-state NMR spectroscopy of microporous materials, and then discuss some more recent advances in this field, particularly those applied to the study of crystalline materials such as zeolites and metal-organic frameworks. These advances include improved software for aiding spectral interpretation, the development of the NMR-crystallography approach to structure determination, new routes for the synthesis of isotopically-labelled materials, methods for the characterisation of host-guest interactions, and methodologies suitable for observing NMR spectra of paramagnetic microporous materials.

To inform this debate, a wide array of indicators that assess the joint influence of fertility, mortality, and migration on birth replacement and intergenerational replacement have been developed. These indicators are based on various models and assumptions and some are particularly data demanding. In this paper we propose a very simple method to assess how far migration alters the extent of replacement for a birth cohort as it ages. We term the measure used here the overall replacement ratio (ORR). It is calculated by taking the size of a female birth cohort at selected ages divided by the average size of the cohorts of mothers in the year of birth. The paper presents estimates of the ORR for a range of European countries representing different replacement regimes. We demonstrate that for many countries net migration has become a key factor in their population trends during the last decades.</description>     <dc:date>2013-03-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:creator>Wilson, Christopher Cleveland Boag</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Sobotka, Tomas</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Williamson, Lee</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Boyle, Paul Joseph</dc:creator>     <dc:description>There are long-standing concerns over low fertility levels in Europe and an increasingly important debate on the extent to which migration can compensate for below replacement fertility.

Aggressive interactions can be costly on an energetic level, demanding increased energy or causing injuries, and on a psychological level, in the form of increased anxiety and damaged relationships between opponents. Here we used urinary glucocorticoid (uGC) levels to assess the costs of aggression in wild chimpanzees of Budongo Forest, Uganda. We collected 169 urine samples from nine adult male chimpanzees following 14 aggressive interactions (test condition) and 10 resting events (control condition). Subjects showed significantly higher uGC levels after single aggressive interactions compared to control conditions, likely for aggressors as well as victims. Higher ranking males had greater increases of uGC levels after aggression than lower ranking males. In contrast, uGC levels showed no significant change in relation to aggression length or intensity, indicating that psychological factors might have played a larger role than mere energetic expenditure. We concluded that aggressive behaviour is costly for both aggressors and victims and that costs seem poorly explained by energetic demands of the interaction. Our findings are relevant for studies of post-conflict interactions, since we provide evidence that both aggressors and victims experience a stress response to conflict.

This introduces a degree of complexity the fair study of the nature of optical OAM (orbital angular momentum). To avoid this, we introduced a new approach by creating a perfect vortex beam using an annular illuminating beam with a fixed intensity profile on an SLM that imposes a chosen topological charge. The radial intensity profile of such an experimentally created perfect vortex beam is independent to any given integer value of its topological charge. The well-defined OAM density in such a perfect vortex beam is probed by trapping microscope particles. The rotation rate of a trapped necklace of particles is measured for both integer and non-integer topological charge. Experimental results agree with the theoretical prediction. With the flexibility of our approach, local OAM density can be corrected in situ to overcome the problem of trapping the particle in the intensity hotspots. The correction of local OAM density in the perfect vortex beam therefore enables a single trapped particle to move along the vortex ring at a constant angular velocity that is independent of the azimuthal position.

This introduces a degree of complexity the fair study of the nature of optical OAM (orbital angular momentum). To avoid this, we introduced a new approach by creating a perfect vortex beam using an annular illuminating beam with a fixed intensity profile on an SLM that imposes a chosen topological charge. The radial intensity profile of such an experimentally created perfect vortex beam is independent to any given integer value of its topological charge. The well-defined OAM density in such a perfect vortex beam is probed by trapping microscope particles. The rotation rate of a trapped necklace of particles is measured for both integer and non-integer topological charge. Experimental results agree with the theoretical prediction. With the flexibility of our approach, local OAM density can be corrected in situ to overcome the problem of trapping the particle in the intensity hotspots. The correction of local OAM density in the perfect vortex beam therefore enables a single trapped particle to move along the vortex ring at a constant angular velocity that is independent of the azimuthal position. Due to its particular nature, the perfect vortex beam may be applied to other studies in optical trapping of particles, atoms or quantum gases.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6261\">     <title>Countermemory and the (Turkish-)German theatrical archive : reading the documentary remains of Emine Sevgi \\ufffd\\ufffdzdamar\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Karag\\ufffd\\ufffdz in Alamania (1986)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6261</link>     <description>Abstract: Theatre history stands in a curious relation to the archive: created from physical, archival documents it then itself helps constitute or contest the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcultural archive\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd which the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdimagined community\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd of a particular area, institution, state, or tradition, draws on.

Two kinds of hypothesis have been proposed. Lethal violence is sometimes concluded to be the result of adaptive strategies, such that killers ultimately gain fitness benefits by increasing their access to resources such as food or mates1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Alternatively, it could be a non-adaptive result of human impacts, such as habitat change or food provisioning6, 7, 8, 9. To discriminate between these hypotheses we compiled information from 18 chimpanzee communities and 4 bonobo communities studied over five decades. Our data include 152 killings (n = 58 observed, 41 inferred, and 53 suspected killings) by chimpanzees in 15 communities and one suspected killing by bonobos. We found that males were the most frequent attackers (92% of participants) and victims (73%); most killings (66%) involved intercommunity attacks; and attackers greatly outnumbered their victims (median 8:1 ratio). Variation in killing rates was unrelated to measures of human impacts. Our results are compatible with previously proposed adaptive explanations for killing by chimpanzees, whereas the human impact hypothesis is not supported.

This study investigated the importance of affiliation to young children following priming with ostracism. Four- and 5-year-old children were primed with either ostracism or control videos and their understanding of, and responses to, the videos were measured. Results showed that children were able to report that there was exclusion in the ostracism videos, and that they recognized that the ostracized individual felt sad. Most interestingly, when subsequently asked to draw a picture of themselves and their friend, children primed with ostracism depicted relationships that were significantly more affiliative. Children drew themselves and their friend standing significantly closer together and adults rated their drawings as more affiliative overall. These findings introduce drawing as a useful new method for measuring social motivations and processes following an experimental manipulation, and demonstrate that affiliation is particularly important to children following even a vicarious experience of social exclusion.</description>     <dc:date>2015-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:creator>Song, Ruiting</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Over, Harriet</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Carpenter, Malinda</dc:creator>     <dc:description>Humans have a strong need to belong.

These findings introduce drawing as a useful new method for measuring social motivations and processes following an experimental manipulation, and demonstrate that affiliation is particularly important to children following even a vicarious experience of social exclusion.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6254\">     <title>A Clean and Selective Radical Homocoupling Employing Carboxylic Acids with Titania Photoredox Catalysis</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6254</link>     <description>Abstract: A titania photoredox catalysis protocol was developed for the homocoupling of C-centered radicals derived from carboxylic acids.

This places not only a cost on the maintenance of the job, but also a cost on the time taken for reinstating the job and the risk of losing data and execution accomplished by the job before it failed. Approaches which can proactively detect computing core failures and take action to relocate the computing core\\ufffd\\ufffds job onto reliable cores can make a significant step towards automating fault tolerance. Method: This paper describes an experimental investigation into the use of multi-agent approaches for fault tolerance. Two approaches are studied, the first at the job level and the second at the core level. The approaches are investigated for single core failure scenarios that can occur in the execution of parallel reduction algorithms on computer clusters. A third approach is proposed that incorporates multi-agent technology both at the job and core level. Experiments are pursued in the context of genome searching, a popular computational biology application. Result: The key conclusion is that the approaches proposed are feasible for automating fault tolerance in high-performance computing systems with minimal human intervention. In a typical experiment in which the fault tolerance is studied, centralised and decentralised checkpointing approaches on an average add 90% to the actual time for executing the job. On the other hand, in the same experiment the multi-agent approaches add only 10% to the overall execution time.

Here, we show that the abundance of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) positively regulates autophagy. Reduction of intracellular PE levels by knocking out either of the two yeast phosphatidylserine decarboxylases (PSD) accelerated chronological ageing-associated production of reactive oxygen species and death. Conversely, the artificial increase of intracellular PE levels, by provision of its precursor ethanolamine or by overexpression of the PE-generating enzyme Psd1, significantly increased autophagic flux, both in yeast and in mammalian cell culture. Importantly administration of ethanolamine was sufficient to extend the lifespan of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), mammalian cells (U2OS, H4) and flies (Drosophila melanogaster). We thus postulate that the availability of PE may constitute a bottleneck for functional autophagy and that organismal life or healthspan could be positively influenced by the consumption of ethanolamine-rich food.

Adenovirus infection was very efficient, even at very low MOI (&gt;95% infection at a MOI of 6) and did not reduce viability. High level LacZ expression was cytotoxic to hepatocytes but Cre expression had no effect on viability. Cre-mediated recombination was completed within a timespan that permits experimentation during primary culture (&gt;95% recombination after 24 h), independently of the number of floxed alleles per cell. Recombination did not induce p53 or produce cytological nuclear abnormalities (even in polyploid cells). Contrary to expectation, deletion of DNA ligase 1 did not alter cell cycle progression, although Cre expression hastens entry to S phase from G(1), independently of the presence of floxed sequences. We conclude that adenovirus-mediated deletion of floxed alleles in primary cells is a straightforward and highly efficient tool for conducting preliminary studies of conditional gene targeting. Primary cells have advantages of differentiation, relative purity and ease of experimentation within controlled conditions, while avoiding confounding problems encountered in vivo (i.e. target cell specificity, kinetics and level of recombination, and elicitation of inflammatory and immune responses).

Previous studies have shown that K-ras is essential for mouse development and that while K-ras 4A and 4B are expressed during development, K-ras 4A expression is regulated temporally and spatially and occurs in adult kidney, intestine, stomach, and liver. In the present study, the pattern of K-ras 4A expression was examined in a wide range of wild-type adult mouse tissues, and gene targeting was used to generate K-ras 4A-deficient mice to examine its role in development. It was found that K-ras 4A is also expressed in uterus, lung, pancreas, salivary glands, seminal vesicles, bone marrow cells, and cecum, where it was the major K-Ras isoform expressed. Mating between K-ras(tmDelta4A/+) mice produced viable K-ras(tmDelta4A/tmDelta4A) offspring with the expected Mendelian ratios of inheritance, and these mice expressed the K-ras 4B splice variant only. K-ras(tmDelta4A/tmDelta4A) mice were fertile and showed no histopathological abnormalities on inbred (129/Ola) or crossbred (129/Ola x C57BL/6) genetic backgrounds. The results demonstrate that K-Ras 4A, like H- and N-Ras, is dispensable for normal mouse development, at least in the presence of functional K-Ras 4B.

However, there is still a need for biomarkers that reliably predict endocrine sensitivity in breast cancers and these may well be expressed in a dynamic manner. Methods: In this study we assessed gene expression changes at multiple time points (days 1, 2, 4, 7, 14) after tamoxifen treatment in the ER-positive ZR-75-1 xenograft model that displays significant changes in apoptosis, proliferation and angiogenesis within 2 days of therapy. Results: Hierarchical clustering identified six time-related gene expression patterns, which separated into three groups: two with early/transient responses, two with continuous/late responses and two with variable response patterns. The early/transient response represented reductions in many genes that are involved in cell cycle and proliferation (e.g. BUB1B, CCNA2, CDKN3, MKI67, UBE2C), whereas the continuous/late changed genes represented the more classical estrogen response genes (e.g. TFF1, TFF3, IGFBP5). Genes and the proteins they encode were confirmed to have similar temporal patterns of expression in vitro and in vivo and correlated with reduction in tumour volume in primary breast cancer. The profiles of genes that were most differentially expressed on days 2, 4 and 7 following treatment were able to predict prognosis, whereas those most changed on days 1 and 14 were not, in four tamoxifen treated datasets representing a total of 404 patients. Conclusions: Both early/transient/proliferation response genes and continuous/late/estrogen-response genes are able to predict prognosis of primary breast tumours in a dynamic manner. Temporal expression of therapy-response genes is clearly an important factor in characterising the response to endocrine therapy in breast tumours which has significant implications for the timing of biopsies in neoadjuvant biomarker studies.

However, from 72 h after Rb deletion, NPM interacts with P19ARF and concomitantly the interaction between p19(ARF) and MDM2 decreases leading to a return to P53 degradation. This occurs despite the persistence of the DNA damage response pathways. We therefore observe in primary cells not subjected to exogenous gene expression or exogenous DNA damaging treatment, activation of 2 concomitant pathways of activation of P53 that are dealt with in independent manner: an oncogenic pathway with rapid activation of ARF which is 'switched off' downstream of p19(ARF) activation after 72 h of induction and a DNA damage response pathway keeping a low level of transcriptionally active P53 sufficient to deal with a physiological elevation of oxidative DNA injury.

While this often takes the form of areas of distinct differentiation into recognized histological subtypes, or different pathological grade, often there are more subtle differences in phenotype which defy accurate classification (Figure 1). Ultimately, since morphology is dictated by the underlying molecular phenotype, areas with visible differences are likely to be accompanied by differences in the expression of proteins which orchestrate cellular function and behavior, and therefore, appearance. The significance of visible and invisible (molecular) heterogeneity for prognosis is unknown, but recent evidence suggests that, at least at the genetic level, heterogeneity exists in the primary tumor(1,2), and some of these sub-clones give rise to metastatic (and therefore lethal) disease. Moreover, some proteins are measured as biomarkers because they are the targets of therapy (for instance ER and HER2 for tamoxifen and trastuzumab (Herceptin), respectively). If these proteins show variable expression within a tumor then therapeutic responses may also be variable. The widely used histopathologic scoring schemes for immunohistochemistry either ignore, or numerically homogenize the quantification of protein expression. Similarly, in destructive techniques, where the tumor samples are homogenized (such as gene expression profiling), quantitative information can be elucidated, but spatial information is lost. Genetic heterogeneity mapping approaches in pancreatic cancer have relied either on generation of a single cell suspension(3), or on macrodissection(4). A recent study has used quantum dots in order to map morphologic and molecular heterogeneity in prostate cancer tissue(5), providing proof of principle that morphology and molecular mapping is feasible, but falling short of quantifying the heterogeneity. Since immunohistochemistry is, at best, only semi-quantitative and subject to intra- and inter-observer bias, more sensitive and quantitative methodologies are required in order to accurately map and quantify tissue heterogeneity in situ. We have developed and applied an experimental and statistical methodology in order to systematically quantify the heterogeneity of protein expression in whole tissue sections of tumors, based on the Automated QUantitative Analysis (AQUA) system(6).

It is well established that the spread of breast cancer, first locally and later distally, is a major factor in patient prognosis. Experimental systems of breast cancer rely on cell lines usually derived from primary tumours or pleural effusions. Two major obstacles hinder this research: (i) some known sub-types of breast cancers (notably poor prognosis luminal B tumours) are not represented within current line collections; (ii) the influence of the tumour microenvironment is not usually taken into account. We demonstrate a technique to culture primary breast cancer specimens of all sub-types. This is achieved by using three-dimensional (3D) culture system in which small pieces of tumour are embedded in soft rat collagen I cushions. Within 2-3 weeks, the tumour cells spread into the collagen and form various structures similar to those observed in human tumours1. Viable adipocytes, epithelial cells and fibroblasts within the original core were evident on histology. Malignant epithelial cells with squamoid morphology were demonstrated invading into the surrounding collagen. Nuclear pleomorphism was evident within these cells, along with mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies. We have employed Optical Projection Tomography (OPT), a 3D imaging technology, in order to quantify the extent of tumour spread in culture. We have used OPT to measure the bulk volume of the tumour culture, a parameter routinely measured during the neo-adjuvant treatment of breast cancer patients to assess response to drug therapy. Here, we present an opportunity to culture human breast tumours without sub-type bias and quantify the spread of those ex vivo. This method could be used in the future to quantify drug sensitivity in original tumour.

It is well established that the spread of breast cancer, first locally and later distally, is a major factor in patient prognosis. Experimental systems of breast cancer rely on cell lines usually derived from primary tumours or pleural effusions. Two major obstacles hinder this research: (i) some known sub-types of breast cancers (notably poor prognosis luminal B tumours) are not represented within current line collections; (ii) the influence of the tumour microenvironment is not usually taken into account. We demonstrate a technique to culture primary breast cancer specimens of all sub-types. This is achieved by using three-dimensional (3D) culture system in which small pieces of tumour are embedded in soft rat collagen I cushions. Within 2-3 weeks, the tumour cells spread into the collagen and form various structures similar to those observed in human tumours1. Viable adipocytes, epithelial cells and fibroblasts within the original core were evident on histology. Malignant epithelial cells with squamoid morphology were demonstrated invading into the surrounding collagen. Nuclear pleomorphism was evident within these cells, along with mitotic figures and apoptotic bodies.

Previously, we observed that promoter hypermethylation in breast cancer reflects cell lineage rather than tumor progression and occurs at genes that are already repressed in a lineage-specific manner. To investigate the generality of our observation we analyzed the methylation profiles of 1,154 cancers from 7 different tissue types. RESULTS: We find that 1,009 genes are prone to hypermethylation in these 7 types of cancer. Nearly half of these genes varied in their susceptibility to hypermethylation between different cancer types. We show that the expression status of hypermethylation prone genes in the originator tissue determines their propensity to become hypermethylated in cancer; specifically, genes that are normally repressed in a tissue are prone to hypermethylation in cancers derived from that tissue. We also show that the promoter regions of hypermethylation-prone genes are depleted of repetitive elements and that DNA sequence around the same promoters is evolutionarily conserved. We propose that these two characteristics reflect tissue-specific gene promoter architecture regulating the expression of these hypermethylation prone genes in normal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: As aberrantly hypermethylated genes are already repressed in pre-cancerous tissue, we suggest that their hypermethylation does not directly contribute to cancer development via silencing. Instead aberrant hypermethylation reflects developmental history and the perturbation of epigenetic mechanisms maintaining these repressed promoters in a hypomethylated state in normal cells.

The aim of the current study was to determine the response of human primary breast cancers to Rac-based drug treatments ex vivo. Three-dimensional organotypic cultures were used to assess candidate therapeutic avenues in invasive breast cancers. Uniquely, in these primary cultures, the tumour is not disaggregated, with both epithelial and mesenchymal components maintained within a 3-dimensional matrix of type I collagen. EHT 1864, a small molecule inhibitor of Rac GTPases, prevents spread of breast cancers in this setting, and also reduces proliferation at the invading edge. Rac1+ epithelial cells in breast tumours also contain high levels of the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor STAT3. The small molecule Stattic inhibits activation of STAT3 and induces effects similar to those seen with EHT 1864. Pan-Rac inhibition of proliferation precedes down-regulation of STAT3 activity, defining it as the last step in Rac activation during human breast cancer invasion. Our data highlights the potential use of Rac and STAT3 inhibition in treatment of invasive human breast cancer and the benefit of studying novel cancer treatments using 3-dimensional primary tumour tissue explant cultures.

Song sharing is hypothesized to occur through several possible mechanisms. Here, we present the first example of feeding ground song from the Southern Ocean Antarctic Area V and compare it to song from the two closest breeding populations. The early 2010 song contained at least four distinct themes; these matched four themes from the eastern Australian 2009 song, and the same four themes from the New Caledonian 2010 song recorded later in the year. This provides evidence for at least one of the hypothesized mechanisms of song transmission between these two populations, singing while on shared summer feeding grounds. In addition, the feeding grounds may provide a point of acoustic contact to allow the rapid horizontal cultural transmission of song within the western and central South Pacific region and the wider Southern Ocean.

Systemic movement of Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) involves two viral transport forms represented by a complex of viral RNA and TRIPLE GENE BLOCK1 (TGB1) movement protein and by polar virions that contain the minor coat protein and TGB1 attached to one extremity. The integrity of polar virions ensures the efficient movement of RNA-CP, which encodes the virus coat protein. Here, we report the involvement of nuclear transport receptors belonging to the importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd family in nucleolar accumulation of the PMTV TGB1 protein and, subsequently, in the systemic movement of the virus. Virus-induced gene silencing of two importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd paralogs in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in significant reduction of TGB1 accumulation in the nucleus, decreasing the accumulation of the virus progeny in upper leaves and the loss of systemic movement of RNA-CP. PMTV TGB1 interacted with importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd in N. benthamiana, which was detected by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. The interaction was mediated by two nucleolar localization signals identified by bioinformatics and mutagenesis in the TGB1 amino-terminal domain. Our results showed that while TGB1 self-interaction is needed for cell-to-cell movement, importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd-mediated nucleolar targeting of TGB1 is an essential step in establishing the efficient systemic infection of the entire plant.

Systemic movement of Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) involves two viral transport forms represented by a complex of viral RNA and TRIPLE GENE BLOCK1 (TGB1) movement protein and by polar virions that contain the minor coat protein and TGB1 attached to one extremity. The integrity of polar virions ensures the efficient movement of RNA-CP, which encodes the virus coat protein. Here, we report the involvement of nuclear transport receptors belonging to the importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd family in nucleolar accumulation of the PMTV TGB1 protein and, subsequently, in the systemic movement of the virus. Virus-induced gene silencing of two importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd paralogs in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in significant reduction of TGB1 accumulation in the nucleus, decreasing the accumulation of the virus progeny in upper leaves and the loss of systemic movement of RNA-CP. PMTV TGB1 interacted with importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd in N. benthamiana, which was detected by bimolecular fluorescence complementation in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. The interaction was mediated by two nucleolar localization signals identified by bioinformatics and mutagenesis in the TGB1 amino-terminal domain. Our results showed that while TGB1 self-interaction is needed for cell-to-cell movement, importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd-mediated nucleolar targeting of TGB1 is an essential step in establishing the efficient systemic infection of the entire plant. These results enabled the identification of two separate domains in TGB1: an internal domain required for TGB1 self-interaction and cell-to-cell movement and the amino-terminal domain required for importin-\\ufffd\\ufffd interaction in plants, nucleolar targeting, and long-distance movement.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6203\">     <title>Limiting Leviathan : an advice book for rulers?

We introduce a method to determine dust extinction which is able to give smooth stellar mass maps even in cases of high and spatially non-uniform dust attenuation.With the spectral fitting we produce detailed maps of stellar population properties which allow us to identify galactic features among this diverse sample such as spiral structure, smooth radial profiles with little azimuthal structure in spheroidal galaxies, and spatially distinct galaxy sub-components. In agreement with the literature, we find the gradients for galaxies identified as early-type to be on average flat in age, and negative (- 0.15 dex / Re ) in metallicity,whereas the gradients for late-type galaxies are on average negative in age (- 0.39 dex / Re ) and flat in metallicity. We demonstrate howdifferent levels of data quality change the precision with which radialgradients can be measured. We show how this analysis, extended to thelarge numbers of MaNGA galaxies, will have the potential to shed lighton galaxy structure and evolution.

This stress can lead to depression, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, burnout and cynicism, having a negative effect on students and their patients. Methods We propose to move towards examining the processes underlying well-being in some medical students and vulnerability in others. We draw upon social psychological literature to propose that self-complexity, medical student identity and associated norms all have the capacity to influence medical students' well-being in both positive and negative ways. Results We identify two key dilemmas facing medical students with regard to the social psychological factors investigated. First, a diverse set of interests and a high level of self-complexity is thought to buffer against the effects of stress and might also be beneficial for medical practitioners, but the intensive nature of medical education makes it difficult for students to pursue outside interests, leading to a strongly focused identity. Second, a strong group identity is associated with high levels of social support and improved well-being, but unhealthy group norms may have a greater influence on individuals who have a strong group identity, encouraging them to engage in behaviours that place their well-being at risk.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to test the noninferiority of two moxifloxacin-containing regimens as compared with a control regimen. One group of patients received isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 8 weeks, followed by 18 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin (control group). In the second group, we replaced ethambutol with moxifloxacin for 17 weeks, followed by 9 weeks of placebo (isoniazid group), and in the third group, we replaced isoniazid with moxifloxacin for 17 weeks, followed by 9 weeks of placebo (ethambutol group). The primary end point was treatment failure or relapse within 18 months after randomization. Results: Of the 1931 patients who underwent randomization, in the per-protocol analysis, a favorable outcome was reported in fewer patients in the isoniazid group (85%) and the ethambutol group (80%) than in the control group (92%), for a difference favoring the control group of 6.1 percentage points (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 10.5) versus the isoniazid group and 11.4 percentage points (97.5% CI, 6.7 to 16.1) versus the ethambutol group. Results were consistent in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and all sensitivity analyses. The hazard ratios for the time to culture negativity in both solid and liquid mediums for the isoniazid and ethambutol groups, as compared with the control group, ranged from 1.17 to 1.25, indicating a shorter duration, with the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals exceeding 1.00 in all cases. There was no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, with events reported in 127 patients (19%) in the isoniazid group, 111 (17%) in the ethambutol group, and 123 (19%) in the control group.

Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to test the noninferiority of two moxifloxacin-containing regimens as compared with a control regimen. One group of patients received isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 8 weeks, followed by 18 weeks of isoniazid and rifampin (control group). In the second group, we replaced ethambutol with moxifloxacin for 17 weeks, followed by 9 weeks of placebo (isoniazid group), and in the third group, we replaced isoniazid with moxifloxacin for 17 weeks, followed by 9 weeks of placebo (ethambutol group). The primary end point was treatment failure or relapse within 18 months after randomization. Results: Of the 1931 patients who underwent randomization, in the per-protocol analysis, a favorable outcome was reported in fewer patients in the isoniazid group (85%) and the ethambutol group (80%) than in the control group (92%), for a difference favoring the control group of 6.1 percentage points (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 10.5) versus the isoniazid group and 11.4 percentage points (97.5% CI, 6.7 to 16.1) versus the ethambutol group. Results were consistent in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and all sensitivity analyses. The hazard ratios for the time to culture negativity in both solid and liquid mediums for the isoniazid and ethambutol groups, as compared with the control group, ranged from 1.17 to 1.25, indicating a shorter duration, with the lower bounds of the 95% confidence intervals exceeding 1.00 in all cases. There was no significant difference in the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events, with events reported in 127 patients (19%) in the isoniazid group, 111 (17%) in the ethambutol group, and 123 (19%) in the control group. Conclusions: The two moxifloxacin-containing regimens produced a more rapid initial decline in bacterial load, as compared with the control group. However, noninferiority for these regimens was not shown, which indicates that shortening treatment to 4 months was not effective in this setting.

The energy source for this turbulence has been much debated with many possible origins proposed. The universality of turbulence, its reported large-scale driving, and that it occurs also in starless molecular clouds, challenges models invoking any stellar source. A more general process is needed to explain the observations. In this work, we study the role of galactic spiral arms. This is accomplished by means of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations which follow the dynamical evolution of interstellar diffuse clouds (similar to 100 cm-3) interacting with the gravitational potential field of the spiral pattern. We find that the tidal effects of the arm's potential on the cloud result in internal vorticity, fragmentation and hydrodynamical instabilities. The triggered turbulence results in large-scale driving, on sizes of the ISM inhomogeneities, i.e. as large as similar to 100 pc, and efficiencies in converting potential energy into turbulence in the range similar to 10-25 per cent per arm crossing. This efficiency is much higher than those found in previous models. The statistics of the turbulence in our simulations are strikingly similar to the observed power spectrum and Larson scaling relations of molecular clouds and the general ISM. The dependence found from different models indicate that the ISM turbulence is mainly related to local spiral arm properties, such as its mass density and width. This correlation seems in agreement with recent high angular resolution observations of spiral galaxies, e.g. M51 and M33.

These results suggest that the processes that give rise to means-end structure in infants' motor behavior also support the emergence of means-end structure in their analysis of others\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd goals.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6183\">     <title>The goal trumps the means : highlighting goals is more beneficial than highlighting means in means-end training</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6183</link>     <description>Abstract: Means-end actions are an early-emerging form of problem solving.

However, for polygenic traits, such as psychiatric disorders, the accuracy of risk prediction is low. Here we use a multivariate linear mixed model and apply multi-trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction for genetic risk prediction. This method exploits correlations between disorders and simultaneously evaluates individual risk for each disorder. We show that the multivariate approach significantly increases the prediction accuracy for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder in the discovery as well as in independent validation datasets. By grouping SNPs based on genome annotation and fitting multiple random effects, we show that the prediction accuracy could be further improved. The gain in prediction accuracy of the multivariate approach is equivalent to an increase in sample size of 34% for schizophrenia, 68% for bipolar disorder, and 76% for major depressive disorders using single trait models. Because our approach can be readily applied to any number of\\ufffd\\ufffdGWAS datasets of correlated traits, it is a flexible and powerful tool to maximize prediction accuracy. With current sample size, risk predictors are not useful in a clinical setting but already are a valuable research tool, for example in experimental designs comparing cases with high and low polygenic risk.

If a partial assignment is shown to be invalid, we are wasting time if we ever consider a symmetric equivalent of it. A particularly important class of symmetries are those introduced by the constraint modelling process: model symmetries. We present a systematic method by which the automated constraint modelling tool CONJURE can break conditional symmetry as it enters a model during refinement.

If a partial assignment is shown to be invalid, we are wasting time if we ever consider a symmetric equivalent of it. A particularly important class of symmetries are those introduced by the constraint modelling process: model symmetries. We present a systematic method by which the automated constraint modelling tool CONJURE can break conditional symmetry as it enters a model during refinement.

However, many consider animal traditions, including those in great apes, to be fundamentally different from human cultures, largely because of lack of evidence for cumulative processes and normative conformity, but perhaps also because current research on ape culture is usually restricted to behavioral comparisons. Here, we propose to analyze ape culture not only at the surface behavioral level but also at the underlying cognitive level. To this end, we integrate empirical findings in apes with theoretical frameworks developed in developmental psychology regarding the representation of tools and the development of metarepresentational abilities, to characterize the differences between ape and human cultures at the cognitive level. Current data are consistent with the notion of apes possessing mental representations of tools that can be accessed through re-representations: apes may reorganize their knowledge of tools in the form of categories or functional schemes. However, we find no evidence for metarepresentations of cultural knowledge: apes may not understand that they or others hold beliefs about their cultures. The resulting Jourdain Hypothesis, based on Moliere's character, argues that apes express their cultures without knowing that they are cultural beings because of cognitive limitations in their ability to represent knowledge, a determining feature of modern human cultures, allowing representing and modifying the current norms of the group. Differences in metarepresentational processes may thus explain fundamental differences between human and other animals' cultures, notably limitations in cumulative behavior and normative conformity. Future empirical work should focus on how animals mentally represent their cultural knowledge to conclusively determine the ways by which humans are unique in their cultural behavior.

Goal 4 (MDG4) aims to reduce child mortality. The progress indicator for goal 4 is the under-five mortality rate (U5M), with a targeted reduction of two thirds by 2015 from 1990 levels. This paper seeks to compare the time (in years) Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries will take to reach their MDG4 target at the current rate of decline, and the time it could have taken to reach their target if domestic resources had not been lost through illicit financial flows, corruption and servicing of debt since 2000. Methods We estimate the amount by which the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita would increase (in percentage terms) if losses of resource through illicit financial flows, corruption and debt servicing, were reduced. Using the income elasticity of U5M, a metric which reports the percentage change in U5M for a one percent change in GDP per capita, we estimate the potential gains in the annual reduction of the under-five mortality if these resource losses were reduced. Results At the current rate of reduction in U5M, nine countries out of this sample of 36 SSA countries (25%) will achieve their MDG4 target by 2015. In the absence of the leakages (IFF, corruption and debt service) 30 out of 36 (83%) would reach their MDG4 target by 2015 and all except one country, Zimbabwe would have achieved their MDG4 by 2017 (97%). In view of the uncertainty of the legitimacy of African debts we have also provided results where we excluded debt repayment from our analysis. Conclusions Most countries would have met MDG4 target by curtailing these outflows. In order to release latent resources in SSA for development, action will be needed both by African countries and internationally. We consider that stemming these outflows, and thereby reducing the need for aid, can be achieved with a more transparent global financial system.

In tropical areas, mesophotic coral reefs may be an important habitat type for many predators but their use of these areas has rarely been investigated.

All predators performed horizontal and vertical movements over seasonal and diel time frames associated with mesophotic reefs. Galapagos sharks performed reverse diel vertical movements diving deeper during the night than during the day, while giant trevally displayed a mix, with some individuals performing regular diel movements (deep during the day, shallow at night) while others performed reverse vertical diel movements. Trevally used very shallow water during the spawning periods in the summer. The isotopic compositions of predators suggest they primarily forage in shallow reefs, although approximately 35% of resources came from mesophotic reefs. Similar to variability in vertical movement strategies, giant trevally occupied a wide range of trophic positions, potentially due to individual specialization in diet and high levels of intra-specific competition. Mesophotic reefs provide some prey to upper level predators but may primarily serve as a refuge habitat. The frequent movements between habitats suggest that marine predators may function as significant transporters of nutrients from shallow to mesophotic reefs.

Tidal downsizing may reduce both the object mass and semimajor axis. However, most studies of tidal downsizing end when the protostellar disc disperses, while the system is embedded in its parent star-forming region. To compare disc fragment descendants with exoplanet and brown dwarf observations, the subsequent dynamical evolution must be explored. We carry out N-body integrations of fragment-fragment scattering in multi-object star systems, and star systems embedded in substructured clusters. In both cases, we use initial conditions generated by population synthesis models of tidal downsizing. The scattering simulations produce a wide range of eccentricities. The ejection rate is around 25 per cent. The ejecta mass distribution is similar to that for all objects, with a velocity dispersion consistent with those produced by full hydrodynamic simulations. The semimajor axis distribution after scattering extends to parsec scales. In the cluster simulations, 13 per cent of the objects are ejected from their planetary system, and around 10 per cent experience significant orbit modification. A small number of objects are recaptured on high-eccentricity, high-inclination orbits. The velocity distribution of ejecta is similar to that produced by fragment-fragment scattering. If fragment-fragment scattering and cluster stripping act together, then disc fragmentation should be efficient at producing free-floating substellar objects, and hence characterizing the free-floating planet population will provide strong constraints on the frequency of disc fragmentation.

This low-index HTL is situated between the opaque bottom metal contact (anode) and the active emission layer. Compared to an HTL with common refractive index, the dispersion relation of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) mode from the opaque metal contact is shifted to smaller in-plane wavenumbers. This shift enhances the outcoupling efficiency as it reduces the total dissipated power of the emitter. Furthermore, the excitation of the coupled SPPs at the thin transparent metal top contact (cathode) is avoided by using an ultrathin top electrode. Hence, the coupling of the electroluminescence from the emitter molecules to all non-radiative evanescent modes, with respect to the emitter material, is reduced by at least a factor of two, additionally increasing the outcoupling efficiency. Furthermore, for sufficiently high refractive index contrast the shift of the SPP at the anode/organic interface can lead to in-plane wavenumbers smaller than the wavenumber within the organic emitter layer and outcoupling of all excited modes by high index light extraction structures, e.g. microlens, seems feasible.

Dust scattering in these partially ionized clouds contribute ~40 per cent to the total intensity of H\\ufffd\\ufffd.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6155\">     <title>HARPS-N @ TNG, two year harvesting data : performances and results</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6155</link>     <description>Abstract: The planet hunter HARPS-N[1], in operation at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG)[13] from April 2012 is a highresolution spectrograph designed to achieve a very high radial velocity precision measurement thanks to an ultra stable environment and in a temperature-controlled vacuum.

Birth sex ratio and litter size adjustment in cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6154</link>     <description>Abstract: Sex allocation theory has been a remarkably productive field in behavioral ecology with empirical evidence regularly supporting quantitative theoretical predictions. Across mammals in general and primates in particular, however, support for the various hypotheses has been more equivocal. Population-level sex ratio biases have often been interpreted as supportive, but evidence for small-scale facultative adjustment has rarely been found. The helper repayment (HR) also named the local resource enhancement (LRE) hypothesis predicts that, in cooperatively breeding species, mothers invest more in the sex which assists with rearing future offspring and that this bias will be more pronounced in mothers who require extra assistance (i.e., due to inexperience or a lack of available alloparents). We tested these hypotheses in captive cotton-top tamarins (Saguinus oedipus) utilizing the international studbook and birth records obtained through a questionnaire from ISIS-registered institutions. Infant sex, litter size, mother's age, parity, and group composition (presence of nonreproductive subordinate males and females) were determined from these records. The HR hypothesis was supported over the entire population, which was significantly biased toward males (the \"helpful\" sex). We found little support for helper repayment at the individual level, as primiparous females and those in groups without alloparents did not exhibit more extreme tendencies to produce male infants. Primiparous females were, however, more likely to produce singleton litters. Singleton births were more likely to be male, which suggests that there may be an interaction between litter size adjustment and sex allocation. This may be interpreted as supportive of the HR hypothesis, but alternative explanations at both the proximate and ultimate levels are possible. These possibilities warrant further consideration when attempting to understand the ambiguous results of primate sex ratio studies so far.

DNA metabarcoding has emerged as having potential to provide speedy assessment of community structure from environmental samples. Here we tested the reliability of metabarcoding by comparing morphological and molecular inventories of invertebrate communities associated with seagrasses through estimates of alpha and beta diversity, as well as the identification of the most abundant taxa. Sediment samples were collected from six Zostera marina seagrass meadows across Brittany, France. Metabarcoding surveys were performed using both mitochondrial (Cytochrome Oxidase I) and nuclear (small subunit 18S ribosomal RNA) markers, and compared to morphological inventories compiled by a long-term benthic monitoring network. A sampling strategy was defined to enhance performance and accuracy of results by preventing the dominance of larger animals, boosting statistical support through replicates, and using two genes to compensate for taxonomic biases. Molecular barcodes proved powerful by revealing a remarkable level of diversity that vastly exceeded the morphological survey, while both surveys identified congruent differentiation of the meadows. However, despite the addition of individual barcodes of common species into taxonomic reference databases, the retrieval of only 36% of these species suggest that the remaining were either not present in the molecular samples or not detected by the molecular screening. This finding exemplifies the necessity of comprehensive and well-curated taxonomic reference libraries and multi-gene surveys. Overall, results offer methodological guidelines and support for metabarcoding as a powerful and repeatable method of characterizing communities, while also presenting suggestions for improvement, including implementation of pilot studies prior to performing full \"blind\" metabarcoding assessments to optimize sampling and amplification protocols.

The related dihalide compounds 13 and 14 Acenapyl[XX] (XX = BrBr, II) have also been prepared by following a similar procedure, and 1,2,5,6-tetrabromo-1,2-dihydroacenaphthylene A0 was prepared as an intermediate by following an alternative route to 13. The series of acenaphthylene compounds have remarkably similar molecular structures to their acenaphthene counterparts; they exhibit an expected increase in peri separation as heavier congeners occupy the close peri positions. The presence of the ethene bridge, however, naturally compresses the nearest bay angle as it increases the splay of the exocyclic peri atoms, thereby resulting in a minor increase in separation relative to equivalent acenaphthenes. The structures of 1-11, 13 and 14 are discussed and compared with previously reported analogous naphthalene and acenaphthene compounds.

Derek</dc:creator>     <dc:description>A series of peri-substituted acenaphthylenes that contain mixed halogen-chalcogen functionalities at the 5,6-positions in 1-6 [Acenapyl[X](EPh) (Acenapyl = acenaphthylene-5,6-diyl; X = Br, I; E = S, Se, Te)] and chalcogen-chalcogen moieties in 7-11 [Acenap(EPh)(EPh) (Acenap = acenaphthene-5,6-diyl; E/E = S, Se, Te)] have been prepared from their corresponding acenaphthene analogues A1-A11 by utilising 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) for the dehydrogenation of the ethane backbone. The related dihalide compounds 13 and 14 Acenapyl[XX] (XX = BrBr, II) have also been prepared by following a similar procedure, and 1,2,5,6-tetrabromo-1,2-dihydroacenaphthylene A0 was prepared as an intermediate by following an alternative route to 13. The series of acenaphthylene compounds have remarkably similar molecular structures to their acenaphthene counterparts; they exhibit an expected increase in peri separation as heavier congeners occupy the close peri positions. The presence of the ethene bridge, however, naturally compresses the nearest bay angle as it increases the splay of the exocyclic peri atoms, thereby resulting in a minor increase in separation relative to equivalent acenaphthenes. The structures of 1-11, 13 and 14 are discussed and compared with previously reported analogous naphthalene and acenaphthene compounds. Similar to acenaphthene derivatives, aromatic ring conformations and the location of p-type lone pairs influences the geometry of the peri region. Under appropriate geometric conditions, quasi-linear three-body C-Ph-EZ (E = Te, Se, S; Z = Br/E) fragments provide an attractive component for the EZ interaction. DFT studies confirm the onset of formation of three-center, four-electron bonding, similar in extent to that observed in analogous acenaphthenes, despite an increase in the peri distances.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6143\">     <title>Roman death</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6143</link>     <dc:date>2014-03-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:creator>Lavan, Myles Patrick</dc:creator>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6142\">     <title>A latent historiography?

The electrical conductivity of a Thiel-embalmed liver sample exhibited a relatively flat frequency response from 100 to 500 kHz, which is the frequency range used for electro-surgery and radiofrequency tumour ablation (RFA). It measured 5 Sm-1 compared with 0.22 Sm-1 obtained from ex-vivo fresh pig liver. Using finite element modelling and experimental evaluation, the ablation zone obtained from the Thiel-embalmed liver sample was extremely small due to its much higher conductivity.

Existing work on activity recognition is mainly concerned with identifying single user sequential activities from well-scripted or pre-segmented sequences of sensor events. However a real-world environment often contains multiple users, with each performing activities simultaneously, in their own way and with no explicit instructions to follow. Recognising multi-user concurrent activities is challenging, but essential for designing applications for real environments. This paper presents a novel Knowledge-driven approach for Concurrent Activity Recognition (KCAR). Within KCAR, we explore the semantics underlying each sensor event and use semantic dissimilarity to segment a continuous sensor sequence into fragments, each of which corresponds to one ongoing activity. We exploit the Pyramid Match Kernel, with a strength in approximate matching on hierarchical concepts, to recognise activities of varying grained constraints from a potentially noisy sensor sequence. We conduct an empirical evaluation on a large-scale real-world data set that is collected over one year and consists of 2.8 millions of sensor events. Our results demonstrate that KCAR achieves an average recognition accuracy of 91%.

The uses of a number of these ruthenium- and copper-based complexes as catalysts in several applications are also disclosed. &#xD; Halfway between the study of the electronic effect of mixed NHC/phosphite ruthenium in olefin metathesis reactions (Chapter 1) and NHC copper-catalysed transformations (Chapters 5 and 6), resides the core of this dissertation that links the book end chapters. Indeed, the NHC-Cu\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd transfer or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtransmetalation\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd reaction is disclosed as a powerful and reliable tool to access new transition metal catalysts in a relatively general manner. The syntheses of a series of various non-conventional NHC-Cu complexes as precursors for the transmetalation reaction are also described in Chapter 2. &#xD; The dissertation finally closes with some preliminary results on what represents the first experimental and theoretical evidence for the mechanism of the NHC transfer by transmetalation. The exploration of the reaction by exchange from copper to platinum has begun to reveal what was so far unknown through the isolation of reactive intermediate species formed during the process.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6124\">     <title>A role for nonapeptides and dopamine in nest-building behaviour</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6124</link>     <description>Abstract: During nest building in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), several regions in the social behaviour network and the dopaminergic reward system, which are two neural circuits involved in social behaviour, appear to be active in male and female nest-building finches. Because the nona-peptides, mesotocin and vasotocin and the neurotransmitter, dopamine, play important roles in avian social behaviour, we tested the hypothesis that mesotocinergic-vasotocinergic and dopami-nergic neuronal populations in the social behaviour network and dopaminergic reward system,respectively, are active during nest building. We combined immunohistochemistry for Fos (anindirect marker of neuronal activity) and vasotocin, mesotocin or tyrosine hydroxylase on brain tissue from nest-building and non-nest-building male and female zebra finches and compared Fos immunoreactivity in these neuronal populations with the variation in nest-building behaviour. Fos immunoreactivity in all three types of neuronal populations increased with some aspect ofnest building: (i) higher immunoreactivity in a mesotocinergic neuronal population of nest-build-ing finches compared to controls; (ii) increased immunoreactivity in the vasotocinergic neuronalpopulations in relation to the amount of material picked up by nest-building males and the length of time that a male spent in the nest with his mate; and (iii) increased immunoreactivity in a dopaminergic neuronal population in relation to the length of time that a male nest-building finch spent in the nest with his mate. Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a role of the mesotocinergic-vasotocinergic and dopaminergic systems in avian nest building.

However, information on social environment may be sensitive to interference by nearby heterospecifics, a process known as reproductive interference (RI). When heterospecific individuals are present in the environment, failures in species discrimination can lead to sub-optimal mating behaviours, such as misplaced courtship, misplaced rivalry behaviours, or heterospecific copulation attempts. All aspects of mating behaviour that are influenced by social context may be prone to RI, including copulatory behaviours associated with mate-guarding in the presence of possible competitors. Here we investigate the effect of three heterospecifics on the mate-guarding behaviour of male Lygaeus equestris seed bugs. We find that, despite previously reported heterospecific mating harassment amongst these species of lygaeid bug, male L. equestris are able to effectively distinguish rival conspecific males from heterospecifics. Thus, heterospecific mating attempts in this group may reflect selection on males to mate opportunistically, rather than a failure of species discrimination.

In order to examine this theme, I have studied, in particular, the following six novels: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl reino de este mundo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, Los pasos perdidos\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl acoso\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, El siglo de las luces\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl recurso del m\\ufffd\\ufffdtodo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLa consagraci\\ufffd\\ufffdn de la primavera\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. In the Introduction, I have investigated the various philosophical questions raised by the concept of responsibility : the debate about freewill and determinism has been examined, and the Existentialist philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre has been chosen as the most helpful in an investigation of Carpentier\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds theory of responsibility, due to a great coincidence of thought between the two writers.&#xD; The protagonists of the novels in question have been grouped according to various distinguishing tendencies or characteristics, and have been analysed in the light of the Sartrian concepts of good and bad faith. These groupings are as follows: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe deluded intellectual\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtwo tyrants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe lesson of experience\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe committed individual\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The success, or failure, of these characters, in matching up to the goals of self-transcendence and responsible commitment posed by Carpentier has been charted throughout Chapters One to Four, and deductions have been made about the various forms of bad faith in which the characters indulge.&#xD; The conclusions that I have drawn from this detailed investigation of characters in good and bad faith are, firstly, that Carpentier sees man\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds goal in life as the attainment of self-knowledge and the honest acceptance of responsibility for the self : once this state of good faith has been achieved, man is able to commit himself to the never-ending struggle for the improvement of the social situation. Acceptance of responsibility for the self is vital, in Carpentier\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds canon, for without such acceptance, positive commitment is impossible.

In order to examine this theme, I have studied, in particular, the following six novels: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl reino de este mundo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, Los pasos perdidos\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl acoso\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, El siglo de las luces\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdEl recurso del m\\ufffd\\ufffdtodo\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLa consagraci\\ufffd\\ufffdn de la primavera\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. In the Introduction, I have investigated the various philosophical questions raised by the concept of responsibility : the debate about freewill and determinism has been examined, and the Existentialist philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre has been chosen as the most helpful in an investigation of Carpentier\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds theory of responsibility, due to a great coincidence of thought between the two writers.&#xD; The protagonists of the novels in question have been grouped according to various distinguishing tendencies or characteristics, and have been analysed in the light of the Sartrian concepts of good and bad faith. These groupings are as follows: \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe deluded intellectual\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtwo tyrants\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe lesson of experience\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthe committed individual\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. The success, or failure, of these characters, in matching up to the goals of self-transcendence and responsible commitment posed by Carpentier has been charted throughout Chapters One to Four, and deductions have been made about the various forms of bad faith in which the characters indulge.&#xD; The conclusions that I have drawn from this detailed investigation of characters in good and bad faith are, firstly, that Carpentier sees man\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds goal in life as the attainment of self-knowledge and the honest acceptance of responsibility for the self : once this state of good faith has been achieved, man is able to commit himself to the never-ending struggle for the improvement of the social situation. Acceptance of responsibility for the self is vital, in Carpentier\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds canon, for without such acceptance, positive commitment is impossible. Secondly, I have concluded that, according to Carpentier, commitment is an inevitable part of life, and that Carpentier\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds goal, then, is that we should actively commit ourselves to a positive cause through recognition of our responsibility for ourselves and our society, rather than tacitly accept the status quo through a passive or deterministic attitude.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6113\">     <title>The role of calcium and predation on plate morph evolution in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus)</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6113</link>     <description>Abstract: While the genetic basis to plate morph evolution of the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) is well described, the environmental variables that select for different plate and spine morphs are incompletely understood.

Tag deployment and handling may itself alter the behavior of study animals and there is a need to assess if and when behavior recovers to an undisturbed level. Not all behavioral changes have fitness consequences, and our goal is to derive metrics that can be linked to fitness implications, such as time and energy allocation to different functional behaviors. Here we detail an approach that incorporates biological knowledge and multiple streams of tag-recorded data in a hidden state-switching model to estimate time series of functional behavioral st ates for 12 sperm whales off Norway. Foraging, recovery and resting states were specified in the hidden state model by state-dependent likelihood structures. Comparison of hidden state models revealed a parsimonious set of input time series, and supported the inclusion of a less informed 'silent active' state. There was a high agreement between state estimates and expert classifications. We then used the estimated states in time series models to test three hypotheses for behavioral change during suction-cup tag deployment procedures: change in behavioral states, change in prey capture attempts and locomotion cost, given behavioral state. Sperm whales spent 34% less time at the sea surface and 60% more time in non-foraging silent active state in the presence of the tag boat (''tagging period'' 0.1-2.8 h) than during post-tagging baseline period (1.8-20.8 h). No comparable pre-tagging baseline data were available. Nevertheless, time-decaying models of tagging effects were not retained in model selection, indicating a short-term effect that ceased immediately after the tagging period. We did not find changes in energetic proxies, given behavioral state, however changes in functional state budget indicate costs in terms of lost feeding opportunities and recovery time at surface. These results are useful to quantitatively identify data periods that should not be considered baseline behavior within tag recordings. This functional state approach proves effective to quantify disturbance in terms of time and energy allocation that is based upon general principles that can be applied to other species and biologging applications.

In this paper, we present the analysis of time-series observations from 2013 and 2014 of five metal-rich ([Fe/H] &gt; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1) globular clusters: NGC 6388, NGC 6441, NGC 6528, NGC 6638, and NGC 6652. The data have been used to perform a census of the variable stars in the central parts of these clusters. Methods. The observations were made with the electron-multiplying charge-couple device (EMCCD) camera at the Danish 1.54\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdm Telescope at La Silla, Chile, and they were analysed using difference image analysis to obtain high-precision light curves of the variable stars. Results. It was possible to identify and classify all of the previously known or suspected variable stars in the central regions of the five clusters. Furthermore, we were able to identify and, in most cases, classify 48, 49, 7, 8, and 2 previously unknown variables in NGC 6388, NGC 6441, NGC 6528, NGC 6638, and NGC 6652, respectively. Especially interesting is the case of NGC 6441, for which the variable star population of about 150 stars has been thoroughly examined by previous studies, including a Hubble Space Telescope study. In this paper we are able to present 49 new variable stars for this cluster, of which one (possibly two) are RR Lyrae stars, two are W Virginis stars, and the rest are long-period semi-regular or irregular variables on the red giant branch. We have also detected the first double-mode RR Lyrae in the cluster.

The experimental results indicate that the framework reduces the workflow execution time and provides a speed up of 1.3x-2.5x over centralised approaches.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6105\">     <title>CRAWDAD wireless network data citation bibliography</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6105</link>     <dc:date>2015-01-02T00:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:creator>Henderson, Tristan</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Kotz, David</dc:creator>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6104\">     <title>Workflow partitioning and deployment on the cloud using Orchestra</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6104</link>     <description>Abstract: Orchestrating service-oriented workflows is typically based on a design model that routes both data and control through a single point - the centralised workflow engine.

These problems are highly prominent when orchestrating workflows that are composed from services dispersed across distant geographical locations.

Reproductive interference (RI) therefore has two components. First, there must be mis-directed mating interactions. Second, there must be costs associated with these mis-directed interactions. Here we consider RI between four species of true bug in the family Lygaeidae, focusing in particular on the fitness consequences to Lygaeus equestris. The species we consider vary in their relationships with each other, including species in the same or different genus, and with or without natural overlap in their geographic ranges. First we show that inter-specific mating interactions, although not a certain outcome, are common enough to perhaps influence mating behaviour in these species (arising in up to 10 % of inter-specific pairings). Second, we show that reproductive interference can seriously reduce female fitness in L. equestris. Importantly, different species impose different costs of RI on L. equestris, with interactions with male Spilostethus pandurus inflicting fitness costs of similar magnitude to the costs of mating with con-specifics. On the other hand, mating interactions with male Oncopeltus fasciatus appear to have no effect on female fitness. In a follow-up experiment, when we allowed competition amongst just females of S. pandurus and L. equestris, the fitness of the latter was not reduced, arguing more strongly for the role of reproductive interference. However, in our final experiments under mass mating conditions with extended ecological interactions (including scope for competition for resources and cannibalism), the costs of RI were less apparent. Our data therefore suggest that the costs of RI will be context-specific and may act in concert with, or be swamped by, other ecological effects. We suggest that comparative studies of this sort that both mimic naturally occurring reproductive interference events, and also artificially generate new ones, will be necessary if we are to better understand the ecological and evolutionary significance of reproductive interference.

Frameworks for valuing nature increasingly include shared/social values as a distinct category of values. However, the nature of shared/social values, as well as their relationship to other values, has not yet been clearly established and empirical evidence about the importance of shared/social values for valuation of ecosystem services is lacking. To help address these theoretical and empirical limitations, this paper outlines a framework of shared/social values across five dimensions: value concept, provider, intention, scale, and elicitation process. Along these dimensions we identify seven main, non-mutually exclusive types of shared values: transcendental, cultural/societal, communal, group, deliberated and other-regarding values, and value to society. Using a case study of a recent controversial policy on forest ownership in England, we conceptualise the dynamic interplay between shared/social and individual values. The way in which social value is assessed in neoclassical economics is discussed and critiqued, followed by consideration of the relation between shared/social values and Total Economic Value, and a review of deliberative and non-monetary methods for assessing shared/social values. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of shared/social values for decision-making.

Recent developments in the North Atlantic region, however, affirm the potential offered by tephrochronology and specifically the search for cryptotephra. Here we review the potential offered by tephrostratigraphy for sequences spanning 130-60kab2k. We combine newly identified cryptotephra deposits from the NGRIP ice-core and a marine core from the Iceland Basin with previously published data from the ice and marine realms to construct the first tephrostratigraphical framework for this time-interval. Forty-three tephra or cryptotephra deposits are incorporated into this framework; twenty three tephra deposits are found in the Greenland ice-cores, including nine new NGRIP tephras, and twenty separate deposits are preserved in various North Atlantic marine sequences. Major, minor and trace element results are presented for the new NGRIP horizons together with age estimates based on their position within the ice-core record. Basaltic tephras of Icelandic origin dominate the framework with only eight tephras of rhyolitic composition found. New results from marine core MD99-2253 also illustrate some of the complexities and challenges of assessing the depositional integrity of marine cryptotephra deposits. Tephra-based correlations in the marine environment provide independent tie-points for this time-interval and highlight the potential of widening the application of tephrochronology. Further investigations, however, are required, that combine robust geochemical fingerprinting and a rigorous assessment of tephra depositional processes, in order to trace coeval events between the two depositional realms.

These invasions typically begin with the introduction of small numbers of individuals unfamiliar with the new habitat. One way in which the invaders might overcome this disadvantage is by associating with native taxa occupying a similar ecological niche. Here we used guppies (Poecilia reticulata) from a feral population in Mexico to test the prediction that exotic shoaling fish can associate with heterospecifics, and that they improve their foraging efficiency by doing so. Guppies have invaded the Mexican High Plateau and are implicated in the declines of many native topminnow (Goodeinae) species. We show that heterospecific associations between guppies and topminnows can deliver the same foraging benefits as conspecific shoals, and that variation in foraging gains is linked to differences in association tendency. These results uncover a mechanism enabling founding individuals to survive during the most vulnerable phase of an invasion and help explain why guppies have established viable populations in many parts of Mexico as well in every continent except Antarctica.

Selenourea and phosphinidene complexes have been proposed to allow the measurement of the \\ufffd\\ufffd-accepting ability of NHCs, independent of their \\ufffd\\ufffd-donating ability, via the collection of 77Se or 31P NMR spectra, respectively. Herein, the synthesis and characterisation of selenoureas derived from a range of imidazol-2-ylidenes, 4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidenes and triazol-2-ylidenes are documented.

The RM quasar sample is flux-limited to i psf = 21.7 mag, and covers a redshift range of 0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4.5 without any other cuts on quasar properties. Optical spectroscopy was performed during 2014 January-July dark/gray time, with an average cadence of ~4 days, totaling more than 30 epochs. Supporting photometric monitoring in the g and i bands was conducted at multiple facilities including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the Steward Observatory Bok telescope in 2014, with a cadence of ~2 days and covering all lunar phases. The RM field (R.A., decl. = 14:14:49.00, +53:05:00.0) lies within the CFHT-LS W3 field, and coincides with the Pan-STARRS 1 (PS1) Medium Deep Field MD07, with three prior years of multi-band PS1 light curves. The SDSS-RM six month baseline program aims to detect time lags between the quasar continuum and broad line region (BLR) variability on timescales of up to several months (in the observed frame) for ~10% of the sample, and to anchor the time baseline for continued monitoring in the future to detect lags on longer timescales and at higher redshift. SDSS-RM is the first major program to systematically explore the potential of RM for broad-line quasars at z &gt; 0.3, and will investigate the prospects of RM with all major broad lines covered in optical spectroscopy. SDSS-RM will provide guidance on future multi-object RM campaigns on larger scales, and is aiming to deliver more than tens of BLR lag detections for a homogeneous sample of quasars. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of this program, and outline the science impact expected from the resulting data for RM and general quasar science.

H II regions in galaxies are the sites of star formation, so they are special places for understanding the build-up of stellar mass in the universe. The line ratios of this ionized gas are frequently used to characterize the ionization conditions. In particular, the oxygen abundances are assumed to trace the chemical enrichment of galaxies. Aims. We explore the connections between the ionization conditions and the properties of the overall underlying stellar population (ionizing or not-ionizing) in H II regions, in order to uncover the actual physical connection between them. Methods. We use the H II regions catalog from the CALIFA survey, which is the largest in existence with more than 5000 H II regions, to explore their distribution across the classical [O III] \\ufffd\\ufffd5007/H\\ufffd\\ufffd vs. [N II] \\ufffd\\ufffd6583/\\ufffd\\ufffd diagnostic diagram, and the way it depends on the oxygen abundance, ionization parameter, electron density, and dust attenuation. The location of H II regions within this diagram is compared with predictions from photoionization models. Finally, we explore the dependence of the location within the diagnostic diagram on the properties of the host galaxies, the galactocentric distances, and the properties of the underlying stellar population. Results. The H II regions with weaker ionization strengths and more metal-rich are located in the bottom righthand area of the diagram. In contrast, those regions with stronger ionization strengths and more metal poor are located in the upper lefthand end of the diagram. Photoionization models per se do not predict these correlations between the parameters and the line ratios. The H II regions located in earlier-type galaxies, closer to the center and formed in older and more metal-rich regions of the galaxies are located in the bottom-right area of the diagram. On the other hand, those regions located in late-type galaxies in the outer regions of the disks and formed on younger and more metal-poor regions lie in the top lefthand area of the diagram. The two explored line ratios show strong correlations with the age and metallicity of the underlying stellar population. Conclusions. These results indicate that although H II regions are short-lived events, they are aff ected by the total underlying stellar population. One may say that H II regions keep a memory of the stellar evolution and chemical enrichment that have left an imprint on both the ionizing stellar population and the ionized gas.

A growing number of studies are documenting acoustic habitats and their influences on animal development, behaviour, physiology and spatial ecology, which has led to increasing demand for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) expertise in the life sciences. However, as yet, there has been no synthesis of data processing methods for acoustic habitat monitoring, which presents an unnecessary obstacle to would-be PAM analysts. Here, we review the signal processing techniques needed to produce calibrated measurements of terrestrial and aquatic acoustic habitats. We include a supplemental tutorial and template computer codes in matlab and r, which give detailed guidance on how to produce calibrated spectrograms and statistical analyses of sound levels. Key metrics and terminology for the characterisation of biotic, abiotic and anthropogenic sound are covered, and their application to relevant monitoring scenarios is illustrated through example data sets. To inform study design and hardware selection, we also include an up-to-date overview of terrestrial and aquatic PAM instruments. Monitoring of acoustic habitats at large spatiotemporal scales is becoming possible through recent advances in PAM technology. This will enhance our understanding of the role of sound in the spatial ecology of acoustically sensitive species and inform spatial planning to mitigate the rising influence of anthropogenic noise in these ecosystems. As we demonstrate in this work, progress in these areas will depend upon the application of consistent and appropriate PAM methodologies.

This will enhance our understanding of the role of sound in the spatial ecology of acoustically sensitive species and inform spatial planning to mitigate the rising influence of anthropogenic noise in these ecosystems. As we demonstrate in this work, progress in these areas will depend upon the application of consistent and appropriate PAM methodologies.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6086\">     <title>Photocurrent readout and electro-optical tuning of resonantly excited exciton polaritons in a trap</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6086</link>     <description>Abstract: We discuss a technique to manipulate and read out strictly resonantly excited exciton polaritons confined in a three-dimensional trap. The polaritons are trapped via their photonic part in a locally elongated microcavity with a high quality factor (Q\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd6000), giving rise to sharp zero-dimensional resonances. Manipulation of the polaritons is achieved by spectrally tuning the quantum well excitons via the quantum confined Stark effect up to 10 meV, while the signal of the resonantly excited polaritons is simultaneously read out via the photocurrent flowing through the device. The effects of polariton-polariton interactions and interactions with the environment are revealed in the zero detuning regime by excitation power dependent investigations. By increasing the polariton number in our trap via resonant optical injection, we observe a pronounced blueshift of the lower polariton eigenenergy towards the weakly coupled cavity resonance. Furthermore, the photocurrent exhibits pronounced nonlinearities when self-tuned into resonance via its excitation dependent spectral blueshift.</description>     <dc:date>2015-01-20T00:00:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:creator>Winkler, K.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Gold, P.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Bradel, B.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Reitzenstein, S.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Kulakovskii, V.D.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Kamp, M.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>Schneider, C.</dc:creator>     <dc:creator>H\\ufffd\\ufffdfling, S.</dc:creator>     <dc:description>We discuss a technique to manipulate and read out strictly resonantly excited exciton polaritons confined in a three-dimensional trap.

MaNGA is a luminosity-selected integral-field spectroscopic survey of 104 local galaxies covering 360\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd1030 nm at R~2200. The IFUs have hexagonal dense packing of fibers with packing regularity of 3 \\ufffd\\ufffdm (rms), and throughput of 96 \\ufffd\\ufffd 0.5% from 350 nm to 1 \\ufffd\\ufffdm in the lab. Their sizes range from 19 to 127 fibers (3\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd7 hexagonal layers) using Polymicro FBP 120:132:150 \\ufffd\\ufffdm core:clad:buffer fibers to reach a fill fraction of 56%. High throughput (and low focal-ratio degradation (FRD)) is achieved by maintaining the fiber cladding and buffer intact, ensuring excellent surface polish, and applying a multi-layer anti-reflection (AR) coating of the input and output surfaces. In operations on-sky, the IFUs show only an additional 2.3% FRD-related variability in throughput despite repeated mechanical stressing during plate plugging (however other losses are present). The IFUs achieve on-sky throughput 5% above the single-fiber feeds used in SDSS-III/BOSS, attributable to equivalent performance compared to single fibers and additional gains from the AR coating. The manufacturing process is geared toward mass-production of high-multiplex systems. The low-stress process involves a precision ferrule with a hexagonal inner shape designed to lead inserted fibers to settle in a dense hexagonal pattern. The ferrule ID is tapered at progressively shallower angles toward its tip and the final 2 mm are straight and only a few microns larger than necessary to hold the desired number of fibers. Our IFU manufacturing process scales easily to accommodate other fiber sizes and can produce IFUs with substantially larger fiber counts. To assure quality, automated testing in a simple and inexpensive system enables complete characterization of throughput and fiber metrology. Future applications include larger IFUs, higher fill factors with stripped buffer, de-cladding, and lenslet coupling. Description: N.D. acknowledges support through CONACyT grants 167332 and 180125.

The article is intended as a contribution to the ethnography of London.</dc:description>   </item>   <item rdf:about=\"http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6074\">     <title>The use of genome wide association methods to investigate pathogenicity, population structure and serovar in Haemophilus parasuis</title>     <link>http://hdl.handle.net/10023/6074</link>     <description>Abstract: Haemophilus parasuis is the etiologic agent of Glasser's disease in pigs and causes devastating losses to the farming industry. Whilst some hyper-virulent isolates have been described, the relationship between genetics and disease outcome has been only partially established. In particular, there is weak correlation between serovar and disease phenotype. We sequenced the genomes of 212 isolates of H. parasuis and have used this to describe the pan-genome and to correlate this with clinical and carrier status, as well as with serotype.

However, little empirical evidence exists regarding the implementation or comparison of such methodologies, or offers proof that such approaches reduce costs. This paper compares the effectiveness of several types of stochastic primitives using unsupervised learning to heuristically determine the root causes of faults. The results suggest that self-healing systems frameworks leveraging these techniques can reliably and autonomously determine the source of an anomaly within as little as five minutes. This finding lays the foundation for determining the potential these approaches have for reducing operational costs and ultimately concludes with new avenues for exploring anomaly prediction.

MA37. Exogenous addition of 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-D-ribose (5-FDR) into the cell free extract of MA37 demonstrated that 5-FDR was an intermediate to a range of unidentified fluorometabolites, distinct from fluoroacetate (FAc) and 4-fluorothreonine (4-FT). Bioinformatics analysis allowed identification of a gene cluster (fdr), encoding a pathway to the biosynthesis of 5-FHPA. Over-expression and in vitro assay of FdrC indicated that FdrC is a NAD+ dependent dehydrogenase responsible for oxidation of 5-FDR into 5-fluoro-5-deoxy-lactone, followed by hydrolysis to 5-FHPA. The identity of 5-FHPA in the fermentation broth was confirmed by synthesis of a reference compound and then co-correlation by 19F-NMR and GC-MS analysis. The occurrence of 5-FHPA proves the existence of a new fluorometabolite pathway. Description: DOH thanks EPSRC and the ERC for financial support.
