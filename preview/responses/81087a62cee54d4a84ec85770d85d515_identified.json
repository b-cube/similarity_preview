K.; Cole, Tim J.; O'Callaghan, Michael; Stock, Jay T. The patterns of association between&#13; maternal or paternal and neonatal phenotype may offer&#13; insight into how neonatal characteristics are shaped by&#13; evolutionary processes, such as conflicting parental&#13; interests in fetal investment and obstetric constraints.&#13; Paternal interests are theoretically served by maximizing&#13; fetal growth, and maternal interests by managing&#13; investment in current and future offspring, but whether&#13; paternal and maternal influences act on different components&#13; of overall size is unknown. We tested whether&#13; parents\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd prepregnancy height and body mass index&#13; (BMI) were related to neonatal anthropometry (birthweight,&#13; head circumference, absolute and proportional&#13; limb segment and trunk lengths, subcutaneous fat)&#13; among 1,041 Australian neonates using stepwise linear&#13; regression. Maternal and paternal height and maternal&#13; BMI were associated with birthweight. Paternal height&#13; related to offspring forearm and lower leg lengths,&#13; maternal height and BMI to neonatal head circumference,&#13; and maternal BMI to offspring adiposity. Principal&#13; components analysis identified three components of variability&#13; reflecting neonatal \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhead and trunk skeletal size,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd&#13; \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdadiposity,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlimb lengths.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Regression analyses of&#13; the component scores supported the associations of head&#13; and trunk size or adiposity with maternal anthropometry,&#13; and limb lengths with paternal anthropometry. Our&#13; results suggest that while neonatal fatness reflects environmental&#13; conditions (maternal physiology), head circumference&#13; and limb and trunk lengths show differing&#13; associations with parental anthropometry. These patterns&#13; may reflect genetics, parental imprinting and&#13; environmental influences in a manner consistent with&#13; parental conflicts of interest. Paternal height may relate&#13; to neonatal limb length as a means of increasing&#13; fetal growth without exacerbating the risk of obstetric&#13; complications. This is the final published version.

Genome-wide&#13; selection scans based on genotype data from native Siberians have previously highlighted a 3&#13; Mb region on chromosome 11 containing 79 protein-coding genes as the strongest candidate&#13; for positive selection in Northeast Siberians 1. However, it was not possible to determine&#13; which of the genes may be driving the selection signal. Here, using whole-genome highcoverage&#13; sequence data, we identify the most likely causative variant as a non-synonymous G&#13; to A transition (rs80356779; c.1436C&gt;T, p.Pro479Leu) in CPT1A, a key regulator of&#13; mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation. Remarkably, the derived allele is associated&#13; with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and high infant mortality, yet occurs at high frequency in&#13; Canadian and Greenland Inuits 2\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd4, and was also found at 68% frequency in our Northeast&#13; Siberian sample. We provide evidence for one of the strongest selective sweeps reported in&#13; humans, which has driven this variant to high frequency in circum-Arctic populations within&#13; the last 6 to 23 thousand years despite associated deleterious consequences, possibly due to&#13; the selective advantage it originally provided to either a high fat diet or a cold environment.

W.; Am\\ufffd\\ufffdbile-Cuevas, Carlos F. There are a growing number of reports of antibiotic resistance (ATBR) in bacteria living in wildlife. This is a cause for concern&#13; as ATBR in wildlife represents a potential public health threat. However, little is known about the factors that might&#13; determine the presence, abundance and dispersion of ATBR bacteria in wildlife. Here, we used culture and molecular&#13; methods to assess ATBR in bacteria in fecal samples from howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata), spider monkeys (Ateles&#13; geoffroyi), tapirs (Tapirus bairdii) and felids (jaguars, Panthera onca; pumas, Puma concolor; jaguarundis, Puma yagouaroundi;&#13; and ocelots, Leopardus pardalis) living freely in two regions of the Mexican state of Veracruz under different degrees of&#13; human influence. Overall, our study shows that ATBR is commonplace in bacteria isolated from wildlife in southeast Mexico.&#13; Most of the resistances were towards old and naturally occurring antibiotics, but we also observed resistances of potential&#13; clinical significance. We found that proximity to humans positively affected the presence of ATBR and that ATBR was higher&#13; in terrestrial than arboreal species. We also found evidence suggesting different terrestrial and aerial routes for the&#13; transmission of ATBR between humans and wildlife. The prevalence and potential ATBR transfer mechanisms between&#13; humans and wildlife observed in this study highlight the need for further studies to identify the factors that might&#13; determine ATBR presence, abundance and distribution.

It is also associated with 1% of cancers worldwide, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lymphoma and Burkitt\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lymphoma. Human and cancer genetic studies are now major forces determining gene variants associated with many cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and Hodgkin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lymphoma. Host genetics is also important in infectious disease, however there have been no large-scale efforts towards understanding the contribution that human genetic variation plays in primary EBV infection and latency. This review covers 25 years of studies into host genetic susceptibility to EBV infection and disease, from candidate gene studies, to the first genome-wide association study of EBV antibody response, and an EBV-status stratified genome-wide association study of Hodgkin\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds lymphoma. While many genes are implicated in EBV-related disease, studies are often small, not replicated, or followed up in a different disease. Larger, appropriately powered genomic studies to understand the host response to EBV will be needed to move our understanding of the biology of EBV infection beyond the handful of genes currently identified. 50 years since the discovery of EBV and its identification as a human oncogenic virus, a glimpse of the future is shown by the first whole-genome and whole-exome studies, revealing new human genes at the heart of the host-EBV interaction.
