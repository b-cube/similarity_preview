This is a contribution to the global Future Earth programme, a 10-year international research initiative that will develop the knowledge for responding effectively to the risks and opportunities of global environmental change and supporting transformation towards global sustainability in the coming decades.</p> <p>Mountain areas occupy 24% of the Earth\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds land surface; they are home to 12% of the global population, and another 14% of the population live in their immediate proximity. Globally, mountain areas are vital sources of water for agricultural, industrial, and domestic use. They include major centres of biodiversity, often coinciding with centres of cultural diversity where traditional ecological knowledge is maintained. In an urbanising world, mountain areas are key locations for tourism and recreation; some include major urban areas.</p> <p>Mountain systems are particularly fragile, and subject to both natural and anthropogenic drivers of change. These range from volcanic and seismic events and flooding to global climate change and the loss of vegetation and soils because of inappropriate agricultural and forestry practices and extractive industries. Thus, many mountain ecosystems are moving along trajectories that couple high rates of environmental change with strong economic changes. The collective effect may be to alter the ability of these ecosystems to provide critical goods and services to both mountain and lowland populations. The vital linkages between mountain and lowland systems are increasingly recognised in global and regional policy debates and action. These diverse and inter-related issues have been addressed in two international conferences organised by the Centre for Mountain Studies in Perth, in 2005 and 2010, and provide the context for the 2015 conference.</p> <h2>Involvement of ECN partners &amp; LTER-Europe</h2> <p>Several sessions at the conference are relevant to anyone with an interest in long-term ecosystem research:</p> <ul> <li>Advances in observatories of mountain social-ecological systems (Jan Dick, CEH)</li> <li><span>LTSER sites in European mountain areas (Thomas Spiegelberger, Irstea)</span></li> </ul> <ul> <li>Mountain ecosystem services, adaptive management and global change (Maria Nijnik, JHI, with others)</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Conference</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>event:featured</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>External event</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-11-18T16:00:48Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/lter-europe-conf-2015\">     <title>LTER-Europe conference &amp; workshops</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/lter-europe-conf-2015</link>     <description>The next LTER-Europe (of which ECN is a member) will be organized as part of a week of events including the final ExpeER Related Sites Group meeting and workshops on infrastructure requirements for European biodiversity research.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>LTER-Europe is combining several meetings in one conference week<strong>,</strong> starting 16 February in Vienna.

One of the aims  of the programme is to promote scientific research that tackles the  grand societal challenges facing Europe and the World. This conference  is an opportunity to gain insight and impact on which scientific needs  that are going to be addressed in Horizon2020.</p> <p>Horizon 2020 points to six major societal challenges to which the  research community should identify solutions. One of these is the  challenge: Climate action, resource efficiency and raw materials. The  societal challenges part of Horizon 2020 should increase the  effectiveness of research and innovation using a challenge-based  approach, bringing together resources and knowledge across different  fields, technologies and disciplines, including social sciences and  humanities research.</p> <p>Aarhus University and the Partnership for European Environmental  Research (PEER) will by this conference, bring research activities  together across disciplines to foster solutions to the challenges facing  society. Fifteen years after the UN Aarhus Convention was agreed in  Aarhus, we will involve the scientific community in a transparent and  evidence-based\\ufffd\\ufffd process to inform and inspire the European strategic  research agenda, in support of a green and prosperous future for Europe  and the World. The conference will include facilitated topical  workshops, where proposals will be formed for future research needs in  an open process.</p> <p>We therefore invite researchers to Aarhus University on the October  2-4, 2013 to take stock of and assess the scientific progress towards  tackling the grand environmental challenges. And to apply the outcome to  provide input to the European Commission on the knowledge gaps and  future research needs in Horizon 2020.</p> <p>The Partnership for European Environmental Research (PEER), of which  DCE/Aarhus University is a member, will take the collected advice of the  conference to the Commission and communicate the views of the research  community to DG Research in November 2013, to incorporate these in\\ufffd\\ufffd the  process of developing and improving the strategic research agenda of  Horizon 2020.</p> <h2>Main themes</h2> <ul> <li>Climate action</li> <ul> <li>mitigation and adaptation</li> </ul> <li>Resource efficiency</li> <ul> <li>natural resources, ecosystems, raw materials</li> </ul> <li>Green economy</li> <ul> <li>eco-innovation</li> </ul> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Conference</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>External event</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>research</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-09-04T14:08:50Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/training-invest-courses\">     <title>Training courses: Integrated Spatial Modelling of Ecosystem Services</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/events/training-invest-courses</link>     <description>One-day introductory course and week-long intensive course covering InVEST software, a family of tools designed by the Natural Capital Project  which helps users to map and value the goods and services from nature that are essential for sustaining and fulfilling human life. *** Course registration closes 31st July 2013 ***</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<ul> <li>Does your organisation aim to map and value the goods and services from nature?</li> <li>Would tools to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternative land use choices be useful?</li> <li>Do you want to develop your skills and knowledge in the state-of-the-art of this research field?</li> </ul> <p><br />If so the following courses may be relevant:</p> <ul> <li>A one-day (14th Oct) 'Introduction to InVEST' workshop- for researchers and practitioners who wish to gain a basic working knowledge of InVEST software</li> <li>A week-long intensive training course (14th-18th Oct)- for users who seek in-depth understanding of the InVEST models and to consider their future development</li> </ul> <p><br />For course programme and application details follow the link below.</p> <p><b>Course registration closes 31st July 2013.</b></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>ecosystem services</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>External event</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Workshop</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>training course</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-07-09T15:25:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Event</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
