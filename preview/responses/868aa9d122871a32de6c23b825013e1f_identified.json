Shimada.  Seventy-seven stations were occupied from northern Washington to southern California along fourteen transect lines.  At all stations, CTD casts were conducted, and discrete water samples were collected in Niskin bottles.  The cruise was designed to obtain a synoptic snapshot of key carbon, physical, and biogeochemical parameters as they relate to ocean acidification (OA) in the coastal realm. During the cruise, some of the same transect lines were occupied as during the 2007 and 2011 West Coast Carbon cruise, as well as many CalCOFI stations. This effort was conducted in support of the coastal monitoring and research objectives of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program (OAP). </abstract>     <purpose>The major objectives of the cruise were: 1) To characterize ocean acidification (OA) conditions on the U.S. West Coast; 2) To conduct inter-calibration measurements near other OA observing assets, including gliders and moorings, in the study area, allowing inter-calibration of these autonomous assets with high-quality, ship-based measurements; 3) To provide calibration data needed to develop predictive models for aragonite saturation state, pH, and other important OA indicators in the California Current System, based on widely measured parameters such as salinity, temperature, and oxygen concentration; 4) To examine relationships between processes leading to OA and hypoxia in coastal ecosystems; 5) To conduct biological measurements in conjunction with physical and chemical OA measurements; and 6) To provide scientific information on OA conditions and trends for resource management and decision support.</purpose>     <startdate>9/4/2012</startdate>    <enddate>9/17/2012</enddate>     <westbd>-126.09</westbd>    <eastbd>-122.89</eastbd>    <northbd>48.38</northbd>    <southbd>37.67</southbd>     <spatialReference>WGS 84</spatialReference>     <geographicName>U.S. West Coast California Current System</geographicName>    <geographicName>North Pacific Ocean</geographicName>        <fundingAgency>       <agency>NOAA's Ocean Acidification Program</agency>       <title>Ocean Acidification Monitoring Network: West Coast Hydrographic Cruise </title>       <ID>OAPFY11.01.PMEL.003</ID>    </fundingAgency>        <fundingAgency>       <agency>NOAA's Global Carbon Cycle Program</agency>       <title>N/A</title>       <ID>#GC10-102</ID>    </fundingAgency>     <researchProject>none</researchProject>     <Platform>       <PlatformName>Bell M Shimada</PlatformName>       <PlatformID>3322</PlatformID>       <PlatformType>NOAA Fisheries vessel</PlatformType>       <PlatformOwner>NOAA</PlatformOwner>       <PlatformCountry>USA</PlatformCountry>    </Platform>           <expocode>332220120904</expocode>    <cruiseID>WCOA2012</cruiseID>    <section>West Coast Ocean Acidification Cruise (WCOA)</section>    <citation>Feely, Richard A.; Alin, Simone R.; Hales, Burke; Johnson, Gregory C.; Juranek, Lauren W.; Peterson, William T.; Greeley, Dana  (2014).

DICE was developed by Esa Peltola and Denis Pierrot of NOAA/AOML and Dana Greeley of  NOAA/PMEL to modernize a carbon extractor called SOMMA (Johnson et al. 1985, 1987, 1993, and 1999; Johnson 1992)</analyzingInstrument>       <detailedInfo>Samples for DIC measurements were drawn according to procedures outlined in the 2007 PICES Special Publication, Guide to Best Practices for Ocean CO2 Measurements, from Niskin bottles into 310 ml borosilicate glass flasks using silicone tubing. The flasks were rinsed once and filled from the bottom with care not to entrain any bubbles, overflowing by at least one-half volume. The sample tube was pinched off and withdrawn, creating a ~7.5 ml headspace and 0.12 ml of saturated HgCl2 solution was added as a preservative. The sample bottles were then sealed with glass stoppers lightly covered with Apiezon-L grease. DIC samples were collected from variety of depths with approximately 10% of these samples taken as duplicates. The accuracy of the DICE measurement is determined with the use of standards (Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), consisting of filtered and UV irradiated seawater) supplied by Dr. A. Dickson of Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO). The CRM accuracy is determined manometrically on land in San Diego and the DIC data reported to the data base have been corrected to this batch 119 CRM value.  The CRM certified value for this batch is 2014.78 umol/kg.  Summary  The overall performance of the analytical equipment was good during the cruise.  We were able to sample every niskin Niskin made available to us; and including the duplicates and samples drawn from the underway seawater line, 1,081 samples were analyzed for dissolved inorganic carbon. </detailedInfo>       <replicate>Duplicate samples were collected from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled, as a check of our precision.  These replicate samples were interspersed throughout the station analysis for quality assurance and integrity of the coulometer cell solutions.

No systematic differences between the replicates were observed.</replicate>       <standard>          <description>Each coulometer was calibrated by injecting aliquots of pure CO2 (99.999%) by means of an 8-port valve (Wilke et al., 1993) outfitted with two calibrated sample loops of different sizes (~1ml and ~2ml).

The specific method used was based upon the open-cell method described by Dickson et al (2003). This method involves first acidifying the sample to reduce the sample pH to less than 3.6 followed by bubbling CO2-free air through the sample to facilitate removal of the CO2 evolved by the acid addition.  After removal of the carbonate species from solution, the titration proceeds until a pH of less than 3.0 is attained, and the equivalence point evaluated from titration points in the pH region 3.0-3.5 using a non-linear least squares procedure that corrects for the reactions with sulfate and fluoride ions (Dickson et al. 2003).  Titration progress is monitored by measuring the electromotive force (E) of a combination glass-reference electrode.   Samples were drawn from the Niskin-type bottles into cleaned 250-ml borosilicate glass bottles using Tygon tubing with silicone ends.  Bottles were rinsed twice and filled from the bottom, overflowing half a volume and taking care not to entrain any bubbles.  The sample tube was closed off and withdrawn from the sample bottle, creating a 5 ml headspace.  Samples were preserved by poisoning with 0.133 ml of a saturated HgCl2 solution.  Sample bottles were sealed with glass stoppers lightly coated with Apiezon-L grease, and were stored at room temperature (21-25 degrees Celsius) for a maximum of 12 hours prior to analysis.   Titrations were carried out in water-jacketed, 250-ml beakers.  The beakers were kept at 24.0 minus plus  0.2 degrees Celsius with water from a constant temperature bath.   Prior to analysis, samples were placed in the water bath to bring them to the same temperature as the reaction beakers.  Seawater samples were dispensed into the water-jacketed beaker using a fixed volume glass syringe. A Metrohm Dosimat 765 was used to deliver acid to the sample beaker in increments of 0.040 ml.  The acid titrant used was 0.1 mol/kg HCl prepared in 0.6 mol/kg NaCl background to approximate the ionic strength of seawater (0.7 mol/kg).    Instrument control and data acquisition was with custom software developed in Andrew Dickson's laboratory at Scripps Institution of Oceanography and modified by a former employee of the NOAA/PMEL Carbon Group using the National Instruments LabView programming environment. Over the course of the cruise we analyzed over 1,500 samples, including duplicate samples and certified reference materials (CRMs).  Typical titrations were completed in 10-14 minutes and required 20-24 acid additions to reach a pH of 3.0. 1,014 values were reported to the database.   </detailedInfo>       <replicate>We collected and analyzed duplicate samples from approximately 10% of the Niskins sampled.</replicate>       <standard>          <description>Analytical accuracy was assessed by periodic analysis of Certified Reference Materials (CRMs) throughout the cruise. CRMs were analyzed approximately every 24 samples.  For this CRM batch, the average offset for system 1 was -0.46 with a standard deviation of 1.04.

Because the outer electrodes are connected together, electric fields are confined inside the cell.  The cell resistance controls the output frequency of a Wien Bridge oscillator circuit.  The sensor has a frequency output of approximately 3 to 12 kHz corresponding to conductivities from 0 to 7 Siemens/meter (0 to 70 mmho/cm).  The conductivity sensor has a typical accuracy/stability of 0.0003 S/m per month, and resolution of 0.00004 S/m at 24 Hz.  Discrete conductivity data were averaged over an 8-second interval, minus plus 4 seconds of the sample confirm bit.  Poor performance by the Autosal made conductivity calibration difficult.  An overall linear fit of CTD and bottle data, including a pressure bias, produced the best results using only the data from the last two Autosal runs.  The fitting routine recursively throws out data greater than 2.8 standard deviations and returns a single conductivity bias and a conductivity slope for each station.  A linear pressure term (modified beta) that is multiplied by CTD pressure and added to conductivity may also be warranted. The order of the polynomial was chosen to keep the standard deviation of each grouping to a minimum while avoiding fitting to fluctuations due to noise in standardizations of salinity sample runs.  Discrete salinity values were derived from calibrated conductivity, temperature, and pressure measurements.</detailedInfo>       <replicate></replicate>       <uncertainty>94% of points were used in the fit of stations 44-81 with a standard deviation of 0.0071 mS/cm.</uncertainty>       <flag></flag>       <methodReference></methodReference>       <biologicalSubject></biologicalSubject>       <speciesID></speciesID>       <researcherName>Kristene McTaggart</researcherName>       <researcherInstitution>Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; PI: Gregory C.

The Autosal bath temperature was set to 24degrees Celsius.  Ambient temperature was also set to 24degrees Celsius and unfortunately was not monitored.  Ambient temperature should have been set to 23 degrees Celsius and recorded with a logging thermometer.  Power to the Autosal was conditioned through a UPS to reduce noise in the readings.  An Ocean Scientific Instruments interface box and software were used to capture readings and compute an averaged value of salinity.   Samples were collected from most casts, at least one from the deepest Niskin and likely a second one from the surface mixed layer.  Samples were collected in 200 ml Kimax high-alumina borosilicate bottles, sealed with custom clear plastic inserts and Nalgene caps, and externally rinsed with fresh water to reduce salt contamination.  Salinity samples were allowed to equilibrate in temperature for a minimum of 12 hours before run in groups of about 34 samples over 6 days.  Samples were sorted deep to shallow before each run.  A bottle of sub-standard seawater (expired batch P147) was flushed ten times through the conductivity cell before a bottle of standard seawater (batch P152) was measured for calibration purposes.  Each water sample was flushed through the cell four times before taking the first reading. After waiting five seconds, six seconds of data were averaged for one reading of the conductivity ratio.  Three ratios were averaged for one salinity value calculated for each water sample.  At the end of the run, a second bottle of standard seawater was measured.  A dilute solution of Triton-X surfactant was flushed through the cell at the end of each session, followed by 400 ml is distilled water.  Distilled water remained in the cell when not in use. AOML program correct_autosal_drift_v4.m was used to apply a linear fit with time over the run to determine a slope and an offset subsequently applied to the samples run.  Runs were appended and resorted by station/sample number.  A total of 152 sample salinity measurements were made during this cruise.</detailedInfo>       <replicate></replicate>       <uncertainty></uncertainty>       <flag>Bot_Salt_QC, WOCE quality control flags are used: 2 = good value, 3 = questionable value, 4 = bad value, 5 = value not reported, 6 = mean of replicate measurements, 9 = sample not drawn.</flag>       <methodReference></methodReference>       <biologicalSubject></biologicalSubject>       <speciesID></speciesID>       <researcherName>Kristene McTaggart</researcherName>       <researcherInstitution>Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; PI: Gregory C.

The sensor has a thermal time constant of approximately 2.5 seconds; and an oxygen response time constant that is temperature dependent, increasing with cooler temperatures, ranging from 2 to 12 seconds.  Hysteresis between the down and up oxygen profiles at deep stations warranted using the downcast oxygen data for calibration, matched by potential density anomalies referenced to the closest 1000-m interval.
