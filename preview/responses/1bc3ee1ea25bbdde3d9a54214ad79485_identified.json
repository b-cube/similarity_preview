Feature-specific contact, type, and source information are stored in relational data tables (described below) designed to be used in conjunction with this spatial data layer. This data set comprises a portion of the Gulf-Wide Information System (G-WIS) database for the entire coastal zone of Louisiana. The G-WIS data include three main components: shoreline habitats, sensitive biological resources, and human-use resources.</dct:description>         <dcat:keyword>coastal resources</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>coastal zone management</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>esi</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>g-wis</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>oil spill planning</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>sensitivity maps</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>wildlife</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>cities</dcat:keyword>     <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/gulf-wide-information-system-environmental-sensitivity-index-cities-database-geographic-na-2001\"></foaf:homepage>     <rdfs:label>gulf-wide-information-system-environmental-sensitivity-index-cities-database-geographic-na-2001</rdfs:label>     <dct:identifier>gulf-wide-information-system-environmental-sensitivity-index-cities-database-geographic-na-2001</dct:identifier>     <dct:title>Gulf-Wide Information System, Environmental Sensitivity Index Cities Database, Geographic NAD83, LDWF (2001) [esi_cities_LDWF_2001]</dct:title>         <dcat:distribution>             <dcat:Distribution>                 <dcat:accessURL rdf:resource=\"http://lagic.lsu.edu/data/losco/esi_cities_LDWF_2001.zip\"></dcat:accessURL>                     <dct:format>                         <dct:IMT>                             <rdf:value>ZIP</rdf:value>                             <rdfs:label>ZIP</rdfs:label>                         </dct:IMT>                     </dct:format>                <dct:title>Zip File</dct:title>             </dcat:Distribution>         </dcat:distribution>         <dcat:distribution>             <dcat:Distribution>                 <dcat:accessURL rdf:resource=\"http://lagic.lsu.edu/data/losco/esi_cities_LDWF_2001.zip\"></dcat:accessURL>                     <dct:format>                         <dct:IMT>                             <rdf:value>ZIP</rdf:value>                             <rdfs:label>ZIP</rdfs:label>                         </dct:IMT>                     </dct:format>                <dct:title>Zip File</dct:title>             </dcat:Distribution>         </dcat:distribution>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>responsible-party</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>[{\"name\": \"Research Planning, Inc.\", \"roles\": [\"pointOfContact\"]}]</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>contact-email</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value></rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>metadata-language</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value></rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>bbox-west-long</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>-93.994255</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>metadata-date</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>2001-06-01</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>dataset-reference-date</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>[{\"type\": \"publication\", \"value\": \"2001-09-01\"}]</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>resource-type</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>dataset</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>bbox-east-long</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>-89.429750</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>spatial-reference-system</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value></rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>bbox-north-lat</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>33.009186</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>coupled-resource</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>[]</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>bbox-south-lat</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>29.241002</rdf:value>           </rdf:Description>         </dct:relation>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>licence</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>[\"Although this data has been processed successfully on a computer system at Research Planning, Inc.

Although the G-WIS database should be a valuable planning and resource management tool, it should not be used to the exclusion of other pertinent data or information held by state or federal agencies or other organizations. Likewise, information contained in the database cannot be used in place of consultations with environmental, natural resource, and cultural resource agencies, or in place of field surveys. Also, this database and related map products should not be used for navigation. Recognize that the information contained in the G-WIS database represents known concentration areas or occurrences of natural, cultural, and human-use resources, but does not necessarily represent the full distribution or range of each species or resource. This is particularly important to recognize when considering potential impacts to protected resources, such as endangered species, wetlands, etc. For more information or guidance on proper and improper uses of these data, please contact the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF) and Research Planning, Inc.
