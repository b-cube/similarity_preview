Church Field lies on a clay lens which overlies surrounding sand and gravel soils. Apart from the A and B horizons, the clay was found to be fairly homogenous down to the maximum depth of 1.1m of the access pit.  On the 1:250,000 Soil Map of South East England the location falls into the soils category 832 Kelmscott Association which comprise mostly permeable fine loamy soils over limestone gravel and variably affected by groundwater and with some risk of flooding. However, on the more detailed 1:25,000 scale Sand and Gravel Resources Map of the Thames Valley the clay lens is depicted as Oxford Clay substrate without sand and gravel cover, surrounded by sand and gravel terraces cropping out at the surface.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Hannah Dean</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chimney Meadow</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Oxfordshire</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-27T13:15:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/968441d3-ce4e-4117-959f-40f36a6a0305\">     <title>Pontbren streamflow data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/968441d3-ce4e-4117-959f-40f36a6a0305</link>     <description>This dataset contains data collected from a network of 13 stream flow monitoring sites located across the Pontbren study site in mid-Wales, UK. The network was established between 2004-2010 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. Data are not available for all sites for the entirety of this duration. 10 of the 13 sites were monitored using bed-mounted acoustic Doppler monitoring systems (Starflows), 2 are monitored using v-notch weir plates with pressure transducers and 1 site simply has a pressure transducer recording stage height. The sub-folders within the main Pontbren streamflow datset folder contain data from the individual monitoring sites. Stage discharge relationships were developed for all sites including those monitored using acoustic Doppler monitoring systems. It is necessary in a lot of cases to use the stage discharge relationship developed in each site to get a better estimate of flow than that provided by the acoustic Doppler monitoring system itself. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and the tipping bucket data is generally split into 6 month blocks. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Details of the dataset, the quality assurance coding system, monitoring locations and stage discharge relationship parameters are provided in the supporting documentation.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/60f54bca-2eea-4024-a877-a1d9717140c6\">     <title>Pontbren rain gauge data </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/60f54bca-2eea-4024-a877-a1d9717140c6</link>     <description>This dataset is from a network of rain gauges located across the Pontbren study site in mid-Wales, UK.  Rain gauges were installed at various locations across the site between 2005-2009 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. Each sub-folder within the Pontbren Rain Gauge data set contains data for each of the different monitoring locations. Each location has a 0.2 mm tipping bucket rain gauge along with a storage gauge, apart from at the Bowl study site where only a tipping bucket rain gauge was installed. Tipping bucket rain gauges were connected to data loggers and the number of tips occurring in a 10 minute period recorded. This data is presented in mm of rainfall / day (mmd 1). Data are provided in the form of .txt files and the tipping bucket data is generally split into six-month blocks.

Neutron probe access tubes were installed at various locations across the site and measurements taken between 2006-2009 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. To estimate profile volumetric soil moisture content (cm3 cm-3), measurements were taken every 10 cm down the soil profile to a maximum depth of 120 cm below the soil surface. Raw neutron probe count data (16 second sampling time) are provided along with shield count (1 x 64 second sampling time) and water count (average 5 x 64 second sampling time) data. These data are provided in .txt files and have columns indicating the site and plot name along with a time stamp. Depth of observation is shown in the column headings of the data. Due to access tubes becoming water logged it was sometimes not possible to carry out measurements at the lower depths of some of the access tubes. Details of the dataset, monitoring locations and how to convert neutron probe counts to volumetric moisture content are provided in the supporting documentation.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/dbfed2a9-b7ba-4638-8f2a-f6ff6916e951\">     <title>Pontbren land use manipulation plot data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/dbfed2a9-b7ba-4638-8f2a-f6ff6916e951</link>     <description>This dataset is from 4 manipulation plot sites located across the Pontbren study site in mid-Wales, UK. The manipulation plots were established at different locations across the site between 2005-2012 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. Manipulation plot sites were located on improved grassland hillslopes and each site had three replicate plots. Following baseline monitoring different land use treatments were applied to individual plots. The different treatments were: grazing (i.e. the control or no change), ungrazed, and ungrazed with planting of trees. Details of the treatments can be found in the Pontbren Catchment Study Data Catalogue. Within the Pontbren manipulation plots dataset folder  there are 4 further sub-folders  which contain data collected from the 4 respective manipulation plot sites. Within each sub-folder exists a further two subsfolders where data is available for overland flow runoff and soil water tension measured within each of the treatment plots. Neutron probe access tubes were also installed in each of the manipulation plots to measure volumetric moisture content (cm3cm-3) and two of the manipulation plots sites (1 and 4) also had rain gauges installed monitoring precipitation. The data collected from these access tubes and rain gauges are available on the CEH Information Gateway.   Overland flow from a 10m x 2.5m isolated plot was measured within each treatment plot at each of the manipulation plot sites. Overland flow data was measured using tipping bucket monitoring systems and the number of tips occurring in a given time period recorded. Overland flow data from the manipulation plots are given in millimetres/hour (mmh-1). Data are provided in the form of .txt files and is generally split into 6 month blocks. The .txt files will either have olf1, olf2 or olf3 in the name and this will indicate which treatment plot the data are collected from. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Details of the dataset, the quality assurance coding system, monitoring locations and the treatment associated with different plots are provided in the Pontbren Catchment Study Data Catalogue.  Soil water tension(cm H2O) data are measured in each treatment plot using an array of tensiometers installed at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and is generally split into 6 month blocks. Within each .txt files column headings 1.10, 1.30, and 1.50 refer to the tensiometers installed in treatment plot 1 at 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm depth. Corresponding soil water tension data from tensiometers in treatment plot 2 will have the column headings 2.10, 2.30, and 2.50 respectively.

The hillslope is an area of improved grassland that has had a strip of trees contour planted across it that was instrumented between 2005-2009 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. Within the Pontbren hillslope dataset folder are overland flow runoff collected from overland flow traps within the tree shelterbelt (Hillslope tree shelterbelt overland flow sub-folder), overland and drain flow occurring above the hillslope (Hillslope runoff weir box sub-folder), and soil water pressure data measured using tensiometers installed above, within and below the tree shelterbelt (Hillslope tensiometers sub-folder). Details of the monitoring system locations are provided in the Pontbren Catchment Study Data Catalogue.  Overland flow and drain flow from the hillslope immediately above the tree shelterbelt was monitored using weir box systems between 2006-2009. Pressure transducers installed in the weir boxes were sampled every minute and averaged and logged every five minutes to provide estimates of flow (ls-1). Three transects of tensiometers installed above, within and below the tree shelterbelt provide soil water tension data (cm H2O) for the period 2005-2009. Overland flow data are also provided from 2 overland flow traps installed within the tree shelterbelt for the period 2005-2009. Traps were installed to collect data from two 5 m x 5 m isolated plots. Initially plots were set up so that the cumulative overland flow volume (mm) occurring between site visits could be measured. This setup was then replaced by tipping bucket systems connected to data loggers (logged every 10 minutes) to provide continuous overland flow (ls-1) data from these plots. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and generally split into 6 month blocks. Note that within the Hillslope tree shelterbelt overland flow subdirectory files with T1 and T2 in the name refer to overland flow traps 1 and 2 respectively. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Details of the dataset and the quality assurance coding system are provided in the supporting documentation.  Other measurements taken at the hillslope study site include soil volumetric moisture content and groundwater height. Datasets of these other parameters are provided by the EIDC Hub. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:40:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/2b7bdff7-cfac-459e-8c50-360da7ba4468\">     <title>Pontbren groundwater data</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/2b7bdff7-cfac-459e-8c50-360da7ba4468</link>     <description>This dataset is from 5 boreholes located on an improved grassland hillslope transect within the Pontbren study site in mid-Wales, UK.

Boreholes 1 and 2 are located in the improved grassland field immediately above the Bowl study site, borehole 3 is located within the Bowl study site and boreholes 4 and 5 are located in improved grassland field below the Bowl, known as the hillslope with tree shelterbelt. Data is presented in terms of height of water (cm) relative to the soil surface. Groundwater temperature (oC) is also given. Groundwater height was initially sampled every 10 minutes until October 2006 when it was changed to sampling every 30 minutes. Groundwater was measured in all 5 boreholes up until March 2008 at which point sampling was reduced to measurements taken from borehole 3 up until the end of 2009. Within the `Pontbren Groundwater? dataset folder there are five other sub-folders which contain the dataset from the respective boreholes. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and generally split into 6 month blocks. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Details of the dataset, the quality assurance coding system and monitoring locations are provided in the supporting documentation. Also provided are the details of the borehole logs at the time they were drilled. Other measurements taken at the bowl and hillslope study site include monitoring runoff from an improved grassland field in the form of overland and drain flow, soil water tension, soil volumetric moisture content, groundwater height and precipitation. Datasets of these other parameters are also provided by the EIDC hub.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:40:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/11caad35-4a33-4ad8-852b-6c120fd250e2\">     <title>Pontbren Bowl study site runoff and soil water tension data </title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/11caad35-4a33-4ad8-852b-6c120fd250e2</link>     <description>This dataset includes data collected from the Bowl site located with the Pontbren study catchment in mid Wales, UK. The Bowl is an area of improved grassland and was instrumented between 2004 to 2010 and monitored as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi Scale Experimental Programme. Variables measured and included in this dataset are the drain flow from a field drain, overland flow runoff and soil water tension within the improved grassland hillslope. Other variables measured at the Bowl but not included in this dataset are: climatic data from an automatic weather station, precipitation, groundwater height, and soil moisture data (using a neutron probe). These other datasets can be found on the CEH Information Gateway.   Within this Pontbren Bowl study site folder are a series of sub-folders with different datasets all associated with the Bowl study site. The Bowl runoff folder includes all runoff data from the Bowl study site. Runoff from the Bowl in the form of overland and drain flow was monitored using a combination of tipping bucket and weir box monitoring systems. Flow is measured in litres/second (ls-1) and runoff data from the bowl was collected for the period end of 2004 to 2010. Differences in sampling time occurred throughout the monitoring period due to logger limitations. Changes in sampling time can be found by examining specific data files. Changes in the size of the bucket of the tipping bucket system also occurred during the monitoring period. It is considered that the weir boxes provide a more accurate prediction of the highest flows, however there are times when they are not operation. The Bowl tensiometers folder contains soil water tension (cm H2O) data collected from two transects with arrays of tensiometers measuring soil water tension at 10 cm, 30 cm and 50 cm depth. Soil water tension data for the Bowl study site exist for the period 2005-2009. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and generally split into 6 month blocks. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Note that for the Bowl tensiometer data in the early years of monitoring data from both transects are provided in one file. From March 2008 onwards there is a reduction in the number of tensiometers installed and the data files are split. Files with BotQC in the title contain data from the lower array of tensiometers and files with TopQC in the title contain data from the array of tensiometers further up the hillslope of the Bowl study site.  Details of the dataset and the quality assurance coding system are provided in the supporting documentation. </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:40:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7afa3b6a-c5c9-4ec5-9e1c-f162411f51cc\">     <title>Pontbren automatic weather station (AWS) dataset</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/7afa3b6a-c5c9-4ec5-9e1c-f162411f51cc</link>     <description>This dataset is from an automatic weather station (AWS) located at the Pontbren study site in mid-Wales, UK. The AWS was installed at the Bowl study site, an area of improved grassland, between 2006-2010 as part of the Pontbren Catchment Study Land Use and Management Multi-Scale Experimental Programme. The parameters measured by the AWS were; incident radiation, wind speed and direction, soil and air temperature, relative humidity and net radiation. All sensors are sampled every 1 minute and provided in the form of daily and 10 minute averages. Data are provided in the form of .txt files and generally split into 6 month blocks. Associated with each data point in the .txt file is a quality assurance code, QA code, in the adjacent column. Details of the dataset and the quality assurance coding system (Appendix A) are provided in the supporting documentation. Other measurements taken at the Bowl include monitoring runoff from an improved grassland field in the form of overland and drain flow, soil water tension, soil volumetric moisture content, groundwater height and precipitation. Datasets of these other parameters are also provided by EIDC Hub.  </description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Bronwen Williams</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pontbren</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Water</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flooding</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Hydrology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Flood risk management</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Continuous</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Weekly</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Water Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project CO2699</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-03-16T09:40:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     </rdf:RDF> ",
