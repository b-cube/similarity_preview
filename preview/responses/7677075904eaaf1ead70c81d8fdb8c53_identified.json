The kinetic energy if an air molecule is directly proportional to the velocity of the molecule.                   - Water Temperature gauges measure the average kinetic energy of water particles.  - Conductivity Sensors measure the ability of water molecules to pass an electrical current  - Water level sensor is an air acoustic measurement device. It is both self-calibrating for variations in the speed of sound and can be leveled directly to local benchmarks that provide absolute measurements referenced to local water level datums.  - Wind Measurement Sensor are scientific instrumentation to measure wind speed and direction.  - Barometric Pressure Sensors are scientific instrumentation to measure barometric pressure.</eaover> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Aquatrak Model 4100 (air acoustic sensor) measures liquid level using a ratio metric technique. The sensor is driven by a microprocessor, a series of electrical pulses are transmitted from the sensor controller and to the transducer. The transducer converts the electrical pulses into acoustic pulses and sends them to the water surface via a sounding tube. As the acoustic signal passes through the cal tube an echo is produced which is returned to the sensor receiver. When the pulse strikes the liquid surface another echo is produced which is also returned to the receiver. The patented ratio metric technique is based upon a pulse time of travel comparison within the known (through the cal tube) to an unknown distance to the liquid level (through the sounding tube). The controller initiates the transducer, times and stores the cal echo, and times and stores the liquid level return echo. The on-board microprocessor calculates the ratio, applies any programmed offsets, performs engineering conversions, and stores the data awaiting a data request from the host data logger or PC (www.aquatrak.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Aquatrak liquid level sensor VX1080 uses a ratio metric technique that compares pressure pulses. The VX 1080 is one of two versions of the Aquatrak rail-mount package for simple integration into the VX1100 system (www.vitelinc.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Dual Orifice Bubbler Paroscientific Quartz Sensor is a pressure transducer sensing device for water level measurement.  A relative transducer is vented to the atmosphere and pressure readings are made relative to atmospheric pressure. An absolute transducer measures the pressure at its location. The readings are then corrected for barometric pressure taken at the surface.  The accuracy, relative to the Datum, is 0.02 meters (individual measurement) and 0.005 meters (monthly means). Thirty-six five second water level samples centered on each tenth of an hour are averaged, a three standard deviation outlier rejection test applied, the mean and standard deviation is recalculated and reported along with the number of outliers (www.paroscientific.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Absolute Shaft Angle Encoder (BEI Sensors) provides an absolute position information over multiple turns of the input shaft.  This sensor is attached to a float/wire system and is used to determine the water level at CO-OPS water level station located on the Great Lakes. These systems are typically configured with 6 ft. diameter sumps that are connected to the lake via an intake pipe.  These substantial structures are required to provide reliable water level measurements throughout the harsh Great Lakes winters.

The sensor measures water depth by measuring the water head on top of the orifice (www.kpsi.com; www.druck.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Air Temperature gauges (Yellow Springs Instruments YSI) measure the average kinetic energy of the air molecules that surround it. The kinetic energy of an air molecule is directly proportional to the velocity of the molecule. Twenty equally spaced samples collected over a two minute period are averaged for each measurement. Accuracy for this sensor is 0.2 degree C (www.ysi.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Water Temperature gauges (Yellow Springs Instrument YSI) measure the average kinetic energy of water particles.  Twenty equally spaced samples collected over a two minute period are averaged for each measurement. Accuracy for this sensor is 0.2 degree C (www.ysi.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: WS425 Ultrasonic Wind Sensor (Vaisala) uses ultrasound to determine horizontal wind speed and direction. The measurement is based on transit time, the time it takes for the ultrasound to travel from one transducer to another, depending on the wind speed.  The transmit time is measured in both directions for a pair of transducer heads. Using two measurements for each of the three ultrasonic paths at 60 degree angles to each other, the WS425 computes the wind speed and direction. Wind speed accuracy: +/- 0.135 m/s or 3% of the reading, whichever is greater.  Wind direction accuracy: +/- 2 degrees (www.vaisala.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: RM YOUNG Wind Monitor measures wind speed and direction. The wind sensor is a propeller with a rotation that produces an AC sine wave voltage signal with a frequency directly proportional to wind speed.  The wind direction sensor is a vane whose angle is sensed by a precision potentiometer. When a known excitation voltage is applied to the potentiometer, the output is directly proportional to the vane angle. Accuracy: Wind Speed: +/- 0.3 m/s and Wind direction: +/- 3 degrees (www.youngusa.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Barometric sensors (Vaisala and Setra) are designed to take accurate barometric measurements at room temperature and for general environmental pressure monitoring over a wide temperature range. The barometric surface pressure is taken into account due to the effect of the hydrostatic pressure of air in different areas.  Accuracy: Vaisala: +/- 0.3 hPa; Setra: +/- 0.05% full scale (www.vaisala.com; www.setra.com)</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Conductivity Sensor (Falmouth Science and Greenspan) measure the ability of water molecules to pass an electrical current.  Twenty equally spaced samples collected over a 2 minute period are averaged for each measurement. Accuracy for this sensor is 0.1 mS/cm (www.falmouth.com; www.greenspan.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Visibility Sensor (Belfort Model 6000) is designed to monitor visibility over a range of 0-10 miles (0-16 km). It includes both analog and digital outputs. Visibility is detected using widely accepted principles of forward scattering. A high output infrared LED transmitter projects light onto a sample volume, and light scattered in a forward direction is collected by the receiver. The sensor's analog output is proportional to the visibility (www.belfortinstrument.com).</eadetcit> <eadetcit>- Specific Water Level Gage: Sutron Xpert Datalogger/Controller (Sutron) is the new primary data collection platform for the National Water Level Observation Network.

They are released for limited public use as preliminary data to be used only with appropriate caution.  Predicted Tidal DataThe accuracy of the tide predictions is different for each location.  Periodically we do a comparison of the predicted tides vs the observed tides for a calendar year.  The information generated is compiled in a Tide Prediction Accuracy Table.  We work to insure that the predictions are as accurate as possible. However, we can only predict the astronomical tides, we cannot predict the effect that wind, rain, freshwater runoff, and other short-term meteorological events will have on the tides.  In general, predictions for stations along the outer coast are more accurate than those for stations farther inland; along a river, or in a bay or other estuary. Inland stations tend to have a stronger non-tidal influence; that is, they are more susceptible to the effects of wind and other meteorological effects than stations along the outer coast.  An example of an inland station which is difficult to predict is Baltimore, Maryland. This station is located at the northern end of Chesapeake Bay. Winds which blow along the length of the bay have been known to cause water levels to be 1-2 feet above or below the predicted tides.  Stations in relatively shallow water, or with a small tidal range, are also highly susceptible to meteorological effects and thus difficult to accurately predict. At these stations, short-term weather events can completely mask the astronomical tides.  Many of the stations along the western Gulf of Mexico fall into this category.  An example is Galveston, Texas. This station is in a bay which is relatively shallow and has a small opening to the sea. At this station it is possible for meteorological events to delay or accelerate the arrival of the predicted tides by an hour or more.</distliab> <stdorder> <digform> <digtinfo> <formname>point vector</formname> </digtinfo> <digtopt> <onlinopt> <computer> <networka> <networkr>http://www.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/map/</networkr> </networka> </computer> </onlinopt> <offoptn> <offmedia>CD-ROM</offmedia> <recfmt>Data burned to CD-ROM</recfmt> </offoptn> </digtopt> </digform> <fees>There is a fee for services rendered by CO-OPS.
