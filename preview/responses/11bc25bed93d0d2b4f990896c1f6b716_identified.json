While some work was published on architectures and decentralized P2P-based mechanisms for such clouds, yet no complete system has been presented which implements such cloud systems without important limitations. We present the community home gateway, a computer system attached to a wireless community network router, able to host platform and application services. Different to current home gateways and other low-end systems, the community home gateway offers resource virtualization, and can thus be used as cloud resource. The community home gateway removes the lack of a system open for service contributions and therefore constitutes an important step towards building P2P clouds with low-end devices. While we present the community home gateway as being part of a P2P community cloud, the applications scenarios of the system that can be imagined go beyond community networks.&lt;/p&gt;</ab>   <la/>   <k1>P2P services, home gateways, community networks;                 </k1>   <pb/>   <pp/>   <yr>2013-09-11</yr>   <ed/>   <ul>http://zenodo.org/record/8461/files/Demo_P2P_2013_v7.pdf;  http://zenodo.org/record/8461/files/Demo_P2P_2013_v7.png?subformat=icon-90;  http://www.p2p13.org/;  </ul>   <no>Imported from Invenio.</no> </reference>   </references>",
