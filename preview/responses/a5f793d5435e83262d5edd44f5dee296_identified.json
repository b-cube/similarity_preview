An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  Each orthoimage provides imagery over a 5000-foot by 5000-foot block on the ground. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is Georgia State Plane West (FIPS 1002) feet with a NAD83 datum.</abstract><purpose>This data depicts geographic features on the surface of the earth.  It was created to provide easily accessible geospatial data which is readily available to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as storm water management and assessment.</purpose></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>20140122</begdate><enddate>20140228</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>ground condition</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Unknown</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-84.683</westbc><eastbc>-84.410</eastbc><northbc>32.247</northbc><southbc>31.899</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>12 inch orthoimage</themekey><themekey>rectified photograph</themekey><themekey>rectified image</themekey><themekey>orthophoto</themekey><themekey>natural color orthophoto</themekey><themekey>orthoimage</themekey><themekey>image map</themekey></theme><place><placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 10-4): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.</placekt><placekey>US</placekey></place><place><placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1987, Codes for the Identification of the States, the District of Columbia and the outlying areas of the United States, and associated areas (Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 5-2): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology.</placekt><placekey>GA</placekey></place><place><placekt>None</placekt><placekey>Webster County</placekey></place></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None.

Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines. These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.</attraccr></attracc><logic>All GeoTIFF tagged data and image file sizes are validated using commercial GIS software to ensure proper loading before being archived.   This validation procedure ensures correct physical format and field values for tagged elements.  Seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected.  Seamline mismatches are not corrected unless the overall displacement exceeds one meter.</logic><complete>Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent images. These images are derived by mosaicking multiple images to ensure complete coverage. Source imagery is cloud free. Photography was flown during leaf-off in deciduous vegetation regions. Coastal areas and international boundary regions may have areas without images (void areas) in parts of the coverage. These void areas have a radiometric value of either zero (black) or 128 (uniform gray).</complete><posacc><horizpa><horizpar>Ground Control Points will be measured in Accuracy Analyst in order to produce an accuracy report for each area.</horizpar></horizpa></posacc><lineage><srcinfo><srccite><citeinfo><origin>Photo Science, Inc.</origin><pubdate>2014</pubdate><title>GPS Photo Control Survey for Coastal Georgia</title><geoform>Model</geoform></citeinfo></srccite><typesrc>CD-ROM</typesrc><srctime><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2014</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><srccurr>ground condition</srccurr></srctime><srccitea>CONTROL</srccitea><srccontr>Photo Science performed a geodetic control survey in support of a digital orthophoto production project covering the AOI.

A total of 278 flight lines with 2446 frames were collected in early 2014 in multi-spectral (RGB and NIR) 16 bits per band format. The imagery was acquired with a 112mm focal length at an altitude above mean terrain of 10,000' to yield a raw pixel resolution of 6\" and 20,000' to yield a raw pixel resolution of 1' suitable for photogrammetric mapping and orthophoto production.  The imagery was collected during leaf off conditions in early 2014 under conditions free from clouds and cloud shadows, smoke, fog, haze, light streaks, snow, ice on water bodies, foliage, flooding, and excessive soil moisture. The sun angle threshold was 30 degrees.  The imagery consisted of panchromatic, blue, green, red and near infrared bands.  The three color bands and near infrared bands have been pan sharpened and archived as frame imagery.</procdesc><procdate>2014</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Ground based photo control points were established throughout the area of interest using a combination of conventional and GPS survey methods in order to support softcopy aerotriangulation and photogrammetric mapping meeting the accuracies specified in this Scope of Work.  This control supplemented the exposure station control obtained from the onboard Airborne Global Positioning System (ABGPS) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Photo control points established for this project have a combined local and network accuracy at 95% confidence of less than or equal to five (5) centimeters horizontally and vertically as determined by the residuals of the network adjustment.</procdesc><procdate>2014</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Utilizing all four pan-sharpened bands [blue (B), green (G), red(R) and near infrared (IR)] digital orthorectification was performed using cubic convolution algorithms resulting in a spatial and radiometric transformation of the digital image from line/sample space into State Plane Zone 1002 Georgia West. The interior and exterior orientation parameters were used to project each pixel into the ground coordinate system, while the ortho grade DEM/DTM was used to correct for relief displacement. Radiometric correction software and techniques were used to create orthophoto files that minimize the appearance of image seams and without loss of feature signature. Orthophotos are checked for geometric accuracy, image quality and tonally balanced to produce a uniform contrast and tone across the entire project. The individual overlapping orthophoto frames were mosaicked together and the final tiles were extracted from the image set to a 5,000 x 5,000 foot tiling scheme consisting of 3,148 individual ortho tiles.  Delivery included digital ortho photos at a 6\" or 1' pixel ground sample distance in 8 bit, 4 band (RGB and NIR) uncompressed GeoTIFF and MrSID files.  The ortho photos meet a horizontal accuracy of +/- 2.5-feet or less at 95% confidence level when compared to higher accuracy check points based on NSSDA testing standards.</procdesc><procdate>2013</procdate></procstep></lineage></dataqual><spdoinfo><direct>Raster</direct></spdoinfo><spref><horizsys><planar><gridsys><gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System 1983</gridsysn><spcs><spcszone>1002</spcszone><transmer><sfctrmer>0.9999</sfctrmer><longcm>-84.16666666666667</longcm><latprjo>30.0</latprjo><feast>2296583.333333333</feast><fnorth>0.0</fnorth></transmer></spcs></gridsys><planci><plance>row and column</plance><coordrep><absres>1</absres><ordres>1</ordres></coordrep><plandu>feet</plandu></planci></planar><geodetic><horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn><ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips><semiaxis>6378137</semiaxis><denflat>298.2572221</denflat></geodetic></horizsys></spref><eainfo><overview><eaover>Natural color orthoimagery is organized in three color bands or channels which represent the red, green, and blue (RGB) portions of the spectrum.
