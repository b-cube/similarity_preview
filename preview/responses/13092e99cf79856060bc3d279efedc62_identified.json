D., Becker, J. V., Figueredo, A. J., &amp; Kaplan, M. S. Structural equation modeling was used to test a theoretical model of the etiology of deviant sexual aggression by adolescents. The subjects were 117 juvenile male sexual offenders who had been referred from either criminal justice or social service agencies to a clinic that treated offenders. The tested theoretical model included several family factors: perceived parental deviance, child physical and sexual abuse history, and children's bonding to their parents. The model as a whole fit the data well. Results indicated that physical abuse by the father and sexual abuse by males increased sexual aggression by adolescents. Also, children's bonding to their mother was found to decrease their sexual aggression. These results are explainable from a social learning perspective and from a parent-child attachment, or social control, perspective, but the alternative perspectives of evolutionary psychology are also considered. Directions for future research are suggested.

Clothing stores sell thongs sized for 7\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd to 10-year-old girls, some printed with slogans such as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdeye candy\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdwink wink\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd; other thongs sized for women and late adolescent girls are imprinted with characters from Dr. Seuss and the Muppet. In the world of child beauty pageants, 5-year-old girls wear fake teeth, hair extensions, and makeup and are encouraged to \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdflirt\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd onstage by batting their long, false eyelashes. On prime-time television, girls can watch fashion shows in which models made to resemble little girls wear sexy lingerie. Journalists, child advocacy organizations, parents, and psychologists have become alarmed, arguing that the sexualization of girls is a broad and increasing problem and is harmful to girls. The Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls was formed in response to these expressions of public concern. In this report,we examine and summarize psychological theory, research, and clinical experience addressing the sexualization of girls.We (a) define sexualization; (b) examine the prevalence and provide examples of sexualization in society and in cultural institutions, as well as interpersonally and intrapsychically; (c) evaluate the evidence suggesting that sexualization has negative consequences for girls and for the rest of society; and (d) describe positive alternatives that may help counteract the influence of sexualization.

The purpose of this report is to shed light on child sexuality, primarily by reporting current research on the normal sexual behaviour of children as well as the state of knowledge of problematic child sexual behaviour. The starting point has been to refer to as much recent empirical research as possible, including international and Swedish studies. The question of what is to be considered \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcommon/normal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd or \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddeviant\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd sexual behaviour in children has become increasingly relevant in recent years due to the attention paid to the problematic area of child sexual abuse. Many professional groups working with children are faced with situations where they are expected to be able to assess the behaviour of children and take the action necessary. It is therefore important to seek to reduce the uncertainty in interpreting behaviour, by increasing awareness of the psychosexual development of children. Sexuality can be seen from various and, to a certain extent, opposing viewpoints, on the one hand as biologically based and thereby guided by biological processes which can be encouraged or disturbed during childhood. The opposing theory is based on sexuality being a social construct determined by the structure of the surrounding society. In between these lie various modified theories on biology interwoven with social constructs. What is \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnormal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddeviant\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd behaviour is thus not set in stone but changes over time, place, society and culture. Studies in Sweden and internationally have indicated that children in the home and, for example, in preschools demonstrate a number of different behaviours which can be linked to the body, sexual identity and sexuality but that more explicit sexual behaviour which imitates adult sexuality is uncommon. Children who are found to have been the victims of sexual abuse on the other hand can display \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdsexualised\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd behaviour. When seeking to determine whether behaviour of a sexual nature should be seen as problematic, and grounds for concern or possible professional intervention, a number of factors should be taken into account. Besides the behavior in itself, it is important to look at the child\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds entire situation: level of development, anxiety, shame, guilt, pain, relationships with adults and friends, the environment in which the child lives and is growing up and the total family situation, etc. What is considered to be sexualised behaviour, with an explicit sexual content, may be due to the child having been the victim of abuse, but it is important to be aware that similar behaviour can also have other causes. It is easy to make child sexuality invisible in our society. This can lead to children becoming confused and left to more impenetrable sources of information to try to understand their sexuality. It is vital that in particular those who encounter children in a professional capacity are aware of how the sexual behaviour of boys and girls can be expressed so as to be able to identify natural psychosexual development as well as those behaviours which indicate a departure from the norm and the causes this may have. More research is required in this respect as well as broad arenas in which professional groups who come into contact with children in their professional work can meet.
