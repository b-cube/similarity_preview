The geographic extent of the shapefile is 0 degrees E to 0 degrees W longitude and 75 degrees S to 90 degrees N latitude.  Many of the undersea features (UF) in the shapefile were selected from a list assembled by Weatherall and Cramer (2008) in a report from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) to the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN). Annex II of the Weatherall and Cramer report (p. 20-22) lists 183 undersea features that \"may need additional points to define their shape\" and includes online links to additional BODC documents providing coordinate pairs sufficient to define detailed linestrings for these features. For the first phase of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) project, Wingfield created polygons for 87 of the undersea features on the BODC list, using the linestrings as guides; the selected features were primarily ridges, rises, trenches, fracture zones, basins, and seamount chains. In the second phase of the USGS project, Wingfield and Hartwell created polygons for an additional 224 undersea features, mostly basins, abyssal plains, and fracture zones.  Because USGS is a Federal agency, the attribute tables follow the conventions of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) GEOnet Names Server (&lt;http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html&gt;). </abstract> <purpose> These polygons are provided as criteria for selecting georeferenced data from other databases. The precision of geographic searches in any system that employs these polygons will depend on the nature of the search algorithm.  This information is not intended for navigational purposes.  These data are intended for science researchers, students, policymakers, and the general public.  The data can be used with geographic information systems (GIS) software to display geologic and oceanographic information. </purpose> <supplinf> U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Spatial Extents for Marine Gazetteers project.  Project Leaders:  Frances L. Lightsom, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP), Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center (flightsom@usgs.gov)  Alan O. Allwardt, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP), Pacific Coastal and Marine Science Center (aallwardt@usgs.gov)  Project background:  Gazetteers of terrestrial and marine regions, including the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), GEOnet Names Server (GNS), GEBCO Gazetteer of Undersea Feature Names, and VLIZ Marine Gazetteer (VLIMAR), generally provide single-point locations or rectangular bounding boxes for named features, because the primary function of these gazetteers is to standardize geographic name usage. Many geospatial information services, however, would be improved if the authoritative place names from these gazetteers were associated with polygons representing the actual spatial extents of the features in question.  The USGS Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP) has created and compiled shapefiles to facilitate the retrieval of georeferenced information resources related to named oceans and seas, undersea features, coastal features and waterways, and relevant administrative areas including the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) counties. Geospatial information systems with the capability for searching user-defined, polygonal geographic areas will be able to utilize these shapefiles or secondary products derived from them, such as well-known text (WKT) representations of the individual polygons within the shapefiles.  CMGP and its collaborators would benefit from improvements in the gazetteers for these existing and planned geospatial information services:  1. The CMGP Knowledge Management Project provides online geospatial search services for research data and scientific information (for example, CMG InfoBank and CMGDS). These geospatial search services currently employ simple map interfaces and/or gazetteers with rectangular bounding boxes for spatial extents.  2. The internal USGS Geospatial Management Information System (GMIS) has a gazetteer with polygons for locating field studies on land, but it offers little aid for offshore searches, where many CMGP investigations are conducted.  3. Information services for two interagency initiatives, marine planning (&lt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/oceans/cmsp&gt;) and the Ocean and Coastal Mapping (OCM) Inventory (&lt;http://iocm.noaa.gov/iwg/&gt;), are under development and could incorporate spatially enhanced coastal and marine gazetteers.  In this context, the primary purpose of including spatial extents for the place names in a gazetteer is to assist information retrieval rather than to establish precise boundaries.  Planned project products, compiled for incorporation into gazetteers:  1. Major ocean and sea boundaries (as defined by the International Hydrographic Organization and VLIMAR), incorporated into USGS gazetteers.  2. Defined spatial extents for high-priority undersea features, incorporated into the GEBCO Gazetteer (in collaboration with Lisa A. Taylor and John C. Cartwright, NOAA/NGDC/MGGD).  3. Spatial extents of named high-priority U.S. coastal features and waterways, incorporated into an authoritative gazetteer.  4. Spatial extents of relevant U.S. administrative areas, including the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), National Marine Sanctuaries, and Coastal Zone Management Program (CZMP) counties (Hartwell and others, 2013).  Project results:  The project will improve communication about coastal and marine activities and enhance usability and interoperability of geospatial data services. The project will lay a foundation for future improvements by demonstrating formats and systems that can be used for incorporating additional spatial extents into marine gazetteers.  Project outcome:  People will be more successful in using familiar place names when they are looking for USGS projects and information, and other federally funded geospatial information, about coastal and offshore features.  Project objective:  To generate a set of databases, in a standard format, that use polygons to define the spatial extents of named oceans and seas, undersea features, coastal features and waterways, and relevant administrative areas.

Annex II of the Weatherall and Cramer report (p. 20-22) lists 183 undersea features that \"may need additional points to define their shape\" and includes online links to additional BODC documents providing coordinate pairs sufficient to define detailed linestrings for these features.  For the first phase of the USGS project, Wingfield created polygons for 87 of the undersea features on the BODC list, using the linestrings as guides; the selected features were primarily ridges, rises, trenches, fracture zones, basins, and seamount chains. In the second phase of the USGS project, Wingfield and Hartwell created polygons for an additional 224 undersea features, mostly basins, abyssal plains, and fracture zones.  Polygons were created and compiled in a single shapefile, using ArcGIS version 9.3.1, with the aid of historical bathymetric maps and bathymetric raster data -- the ETOPO1 global relief model (NOAA National Geophysical Data Center, 2009) was used unless noted otherwise in the COMMENTS attribute field. Primary scientific literature was used to resolve ambiguous feature extents and is cited in the COMMENTS attribute field. Maps from the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) and the International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean (IBCAO) were also consulted as needed but are not cited in the COMMENTS attribute field. Adjacent polygons were snapped together, except for clearly overlapping and nested features.  The UFI and DSG attributes follow the GEOnet Names Server geographic information system (GIS) compatible format (&lt;http:earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/gis_countryfiles.html&gt;). UFI and DSG values are taken from the GNS database. The federally approved name in GNS is given in the UF_NAME attribute field (except as noted in the COMMENTS attribute field). Variant names used by GEBCO or USGS are listed in the VAR_NAME attribute field if applicable. Polygon centroids (CENT_LAT and CENT_LONG attribute fields) were determined using ArcGIS Calculate Geometry, in the WGS 84 geographical coordinate system. (CENT_LONG values for features crossing the 180th meridian were estimated by inspection in ArcMap.) The centroid of a highly irregular or non-convex feature may fall outside the perimeter of the polygon, as this calculated value represents the average center.  Depth ranges included in the COMMENTS attribute field for some features represent the approximate depth in meters below sea level.  These values were obtained by examining bathymetric maps and bathymetric raster data to determine the minimum and maximum depths that define the feature and its spatial extent.  Depth ranges typically apply to features such as basins, plains, and seamounts, which are reasonably defined by closed isobaths, but do not apply to features such as canyons, fans, and escarpments. AREA_SQKM values were determined using ArcGIS Calculate Geometry, with datum WGS 84 and sinusoidal (equal area) projection.  The sinusoidal projection preserves area but distorts perimeter values for high-latitude features. </procdesc> <procdate>2009-2014</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> <ptvctinf> <sdtsterm> <sdtstype>G-polygon</sdtstype> <ptvctcnt>311</ptvctcnt> </sdtsterm> </ptvctinf> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres>0.000001</latres> <longres>0.000001</longres> <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit> </geograph> <geodetic> <horizdn>D_WGS_1984</horizdn> <ellips>WGS_1984</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257224</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>undersea_features.shp</enttypl> <enttypd>Shapefile for selected undersea features.</enttypd> <enttypds>USGS</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>FID</attrlabl> <attrdef>Internal feature number.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Sequential unique whole numbers that are automatically generated.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>Shape</attrlabl> <attrdef>Feature geometry.</attrdef> <attrdefs>ESRI</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <udom>Coordinates defining the features.</udom> </attrdomv> </attr> <attr> <attrlabl>UFI</attrlabl> <attrdef>Unique Feature Identifier.
