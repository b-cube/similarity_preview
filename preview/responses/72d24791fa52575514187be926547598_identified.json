However, this is largely speculative and is based on few data, a troubling fact considering the importance of sex ratios when modeling the status of marine turtle populations. Marine turtles exhibit temperature sex determination (TSD), such that the overall sex ratio of hatchlings produced on a nesting beach is affected by the incubation temperatures on that beach (Mrosovsky and Yntema 1980, Rimblot et al. 1985). This creates unique susceptibility of marine turtles to global climate change and deforestation at nesting beaches (Hawkes et al. 2007). And although research has shown that the temperature threshold may vary among species and beaches, there are relatively few studies on hatchling sex ratios (Chevalier et al. 1999, Wibbels 2003, Mrosovsky et al. 2009). Considering the extreme importance of knowing sex ratio when modeling population abundance and trends, it is essential to conduct studies to determine sex ratio at various nesting beaches. In this study, we proposed to monitor thermal environments at the St. Croix, USVI, leatherback turtle nesting beach and the Bahia de Jiquilisco-Xiriualtique Biosphere Reserve in El Salvador for hawksbill turtles.</abstract>          <purpose>The importance of understanding vital rates of marine turtles to successful management has been discussed repeatedly. The critical need to improve estimates of demographic parameters can be considered a central theme necessary to improve NMFS' ability to monitor and recover marine turtle stocks within U.S. jurisdictional waters.  For example, the need to develop robust estimates of hatchling sex ratios, growth rates, and survivorship has been cited in numerous NMFS documents, including the recent National Research Council report (NRC 2010), all NMFS-FWS marine turtle recovery plans (e.g., NMFS and FWS 1991), and the NMFS Stock Assessment Improvement Plan (NMFS 2004). Progress on estimating these demographic parameters, however, has been slow - partially due to the slow somatic growth of marine turtles but also due to the lack of dedicated long-term studies. Because of the longevity of marine turtles, reliable estimates of demographic parameters require long-term studies. Potential variation among populations and locations over a long-time period require these studies to be replicated at multiple locations.  In the present proposal, we elaborate on three much-needed aspects on marine turtle life history.  We are proposing these elements because 1) there are relatively inexpensive, and 2) they will provide much needed data for several marine turtle populations for which such data are unavailable, in all cases allowing us to move from Tier 1 (inadequate) stock assessment levels to Tier 2 (adequate) status as per \"A Requirements Plan for Improving the Understanding of the Status of U.S. Protected Marine Species (or the SAIP, NMFS 2004).\"</purpose>          <supplinf/>       </descript>       <timeperd>          <timeinfo>             <rngdates>                <begdate>201204</begdate>                <enddate>Present                                             </enddate>             </rngdates>          </timeinfo>          <current/>       </timeperd>       <status>          <progress>                                 In work                             </progress>          <update/>       </status>       <spdom><!-- descgeog: U.S. Virgin Islands and El Salvador--><bounding>             <westbc/>             <eastbc/>             <northbc/>             <southbc/>          </bounding>       </spdom>       <keywords>          <theme>             <themekt>None</themekt>             <themekey>leatherback</themekey>             <themekey>hawksbill</themekey>             <themekey>ecology</themekey>             <themekey>turtle</themekey>             <themekey>sex ratio</themekey>             <themekey>hatchling</themekey>             <themekey>temperature</themekey>          </theme>       </keywords>       <accconst/>       <useconst/>       <ptcontac>          <cntinfo>             <cntperp>                <cntper>Eguchi, Tomo </cntper>                <cntorg>Southwest Fisheries Science Center</cntorg>             </cntperp>             <cntaddr>                <addrtype>mailing</addrtype>                <address>8901 La Jolla Shores Dr</address>                <city>La Jolla</city>                <state>CA</state>                <postal>92037</postal>                <country>USA</country>             </cntaddr>             <cntvoice>(858) 546-5615</cntvoice>             <cntfax>(858) 546-7003</cntfax>             <cntemail>Tomo.Eguchi@noaa.gov</cntemail>             <hours>M-F 8:00 - 16:30</hours>          </cntinfo>       </ptcontac>       <secinfo>          <secsys/>          <secclass>Unclassified</secclass>          <sechandl/>       </secinfo>    </idinfo>    <metainfo>       <metd>20130130</metd>       <metfrd>20140131</metfrd>       <metc>          <cntinfo>             <cntperp>                <cntper>Prosperi, Dan L</cntper>                <cntorg>Southwest Fisheries Science Center</cntorg>             </cntperp>             <cntaddr>                <addrtype>mailing</addrtype>                <address>8901 La Jolla Shores Dr, Room 257</address>                <city>La Jolla</city>                <state>CA</state>                <postal>92037</postal>                <country>USA</country>             </cntaddr>             <cntvoice>858-546-5667</cntvoice>             <cntfax>858-546-7003</cntfax>             <cntemail>Dan.Prosperi@noaa.gov</cntemail>             <hours>M-F 8:00 - 17:00</hours>          </cntinfo>       </metc>       <metstdn>Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata: Extensions for Remote Sensing Metadata</metstdn>       <metstdv>FGDC-STD-012-2002</metstdv>       <metuc>Disclaimer - While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by any errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
