The coverage is the nearshore of Long Island, NY in the vicinity of Fire Island. The seismic-reflection data are stored as SEG-Y standard format that can be read and manipulated by most seismic-processing software. Much of the information specific to the data are contained in the headers of the SEG-Y format files. The file system format is ISO 9660 which can be read with DOS, Unix, and MAC operating systems with the appropriate CD-ROM driver software installed.  For more information on the seismic surveys see http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=1997-032-FA and http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/operations/ia/public_ds_info.php?fa=1997-032-FA  These data are also available via GeoMapApp (http://www.geomapapp.org/) and Virtual Ocean ( http://www.virtualocean.org/) earth science exploration and visualization applications.</abstract>       <purpose>This project will generate reconnaissance maps of the sea floor offshore of the New York - New Jersey metropolitan area -- the most heavily populated, and one of the most impacted coastal regions of the United States. The surveys will provide an overall synthesis of the sea floor environment, including seabed texture and bed forms, Quaternary strata geometry, and anthropogenic impact (e.g., ocean dumping, trawling, channel dredging). The goal of this project is to survey the offshore area, the harbor, and the southern shore of Long Island, providing a regional synthesis to support a wide range of management decisions and a basis for further process-oriented investigations. The project is conducted cooperatively with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer (USACE).</purpose>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>19970926</begdate>           <enddate>19971020</enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>publication date</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>In work</progress>       <update>As needed</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-72.830505</westbc>         <eastbc>-71.791921</eastbc>         <northbc>41.082970</northbc>         <southbc>40.637811</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>None</themekt>         <themekey>seismic reflection</themekey>         <themekey>SEG-Y</themekey>         <themekey>Boomer</themekey>         <themekey>Geopulse</themekey>         <themekey>ISO 9660 CD-ROM</themekey>         <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey>         <themekey>USGS</themekey>         <themekey>field activity 97032</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>         <themekey>oceans</themekey>         <themekey>oceans and coastal</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>None</placekt>         <placekey>Atlantic Ocean</placekey>         <placekey>New York</placekey>         <placekey>NY</placekey>         <placekey>Long Island inner shelf</placekey>         <placekey>Fire Island</placekey>         <placekey>North America</placekey>         <placekey>United States</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>none</accconst>     <useconst>Public domain data from the U.S. Government are freely redistributable with proper metadata and source attribution.

A Geopulse or Huntec electro-mechanical source was used. ITI and Benthos streamers were the receivers. Seismic data were logged digitally with the Mudseis acquisition system. The SEG-Y data were checked for quality with SEISUNIX seismic processing software and are archived on this CD-ROM. The SEG-Y format is described in detail by Barry and others (1975). The files are in standard 16-bit integer SEG-Y format. The SEG-Y files consist of shot files with one or two traces per shot depending if one or two channels were recorded. Channel one was an ITI streamer and channel 2 when recorded was a Benthos streamer. There are 1600 samples per trace. The sample rate was 0.125 ms which resulted in a trace length of 200 ms. The boomer was fired at a rate of 0.5 seconds.</eaover>       <eadetcit>Barry, K.M., Cavers, D.A., and Kneale, C.W., 1975, Recommended standards for digital tape formats, in Digital Tape Standards; Society of Exploration Geophysicists [\"Recommended standards for digital tape formats\" reprinted from Geophysics, v. 32, p. 1073 - 1084; v. 37, p. 36-44; v. 40, p. 344 - 352.] p. 22 - 30.</eadetcit>     </overview>   </eainfo>   <distinfo>     <distrib>       <cntinfo>         <cntperp>           <cntper>Soderberg, Nancy</cntper>           <cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>         </cntperp>         <cntpos>Data Library</cntpos>         <cntaddr>           <addrtype>mailing address</addrtype>           <address>U.S. Geological Survey Woods Hole Field Center 384 Woods Hole Road Quissett Campus</address>           <city>Woods Hole</city>           <state>MA</state>           <postal>02543-1598</postal>           <country>USA</country>         </cntaddr>         <cntvoice>(508) 548-8700</cntvoice>         <cntfax>(508) 457-2310</cntfax>         <cntemail>nsoderberg@usgs.gov</cntemail>       </cntinfo>     </distrib>     <resdesc>U.S. Geological Suvey Internal DVD Data Archive</resdesc>     <distliab>This DVD publication was prepared by an agency of the United States Government.
