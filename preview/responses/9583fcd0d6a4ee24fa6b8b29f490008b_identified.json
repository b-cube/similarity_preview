The Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) was developed in 2003 by the USDA as a multi-agency effort to quantify the environmental benefits of conservation practices applied by private landowners.  Ten Special Emphasis Watersheds (SEW) were identified throughout the U.S. to address specific resource concerns such as animal feeding operations, water use, drainage management and wildlife habitat restoration.  The Jobos Bay watershed was selected by CEAP partners as the first tropical CEAP SEW with the goal of identifying innovative conservation practices that will enhance the health of coral reef ecosystems.  The project\\ufffd\\ufffds general approach includes describing the baseline conditions in Jobos Bay, implementing agricultural conservation practices on the watershed and measuring the response in Jobos Bay\\ufffd\\ufffds water quality, biogeochemistry, benthic habitats and marine biota. It is anticipated that relatively short term changes will be measured in water quality and marine sediments; while long-term changes in higher trophic levels, such as fishes, may be detected in out-years. The baseline biological monitoring was conducted in June 2009 by the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment's Biogeography Branch. Biogeography Branch staff used monitoring protocols developed under NOAA\\ufffd\\ufffds Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystem Monitoring Project, which have been used since 2001 to monitor fish and benthic habitats in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. These protocols are standardized throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish abundance and distribution trends between locations. Specific objectives were: (1) to spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of both reef fishes and macro-invertebrates (conch, lobster and sea urchin), (2) to relate this information to in situ data collected on associated benthic composition parameters, (3) to use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting, and (4) to establish the efficacy of those management decisions. Using ArcView GIS software, nearshore benthic habitat maps created by NOAA\\ufffd\\ufffds BB in 2001 were stratified to select sampling stations. Sites were randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area. At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information were then quantified following standardized protocols. By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BB is able to model and map species level and community level information.</abstract>    <purpose>(1) to spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of both reef fishes and macro-invertebrates (conch, lobster and sea urchin), (2) to relate this information to in situ data collected on associated benthic composition parameters, (3) to use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting, and (4) to establish the efficacy of those management decisions.</purpose>    <supplinf>This work is being conducted in collaboration with the Coral Reef Conservation Program, USDA and Jobos Bay NERRs.</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>200906</begdate>      <enddate>200906</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>Ground Condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>Complete</progress>    <update>one time only</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-66.35</westbc>     <eastbc>-66.16</eastbc>     <northbc>17.98</northbc>     <southbc>17.85</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>NOS Data Explorer Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>Environmental Monitoring</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>Numeric Data Sets &gt; Fish Census</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment &gt; Reef fish census &gt; Belt transect</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Mangroves &gt; Monitoring</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Mangroves &gt; Animal association</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment &gt; Reef fish census &gt; Linear transect</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Marine Plants &gt; Seagrass &gt; Monitoring</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Species richness</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish assemblages</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish Census</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>biota</themekey>     <themekey>002</themekey>     <themekey>environment</themekey>     <themekey>007</themekey>     <themekey>oceans</themekey>     <themekey>014</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>coral reef fishes</themekey>     <themekey>Visual Images &gt; Reptiles</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt>     <placekey>OCEAN BASIN &gt; Atlantic Ocean &gt; Caribbean Sea /North Atlantic Ocean &gt; Puerto Rico &gt; Salinas &gt; Jobos Bay (Bahia de Jobos) (17N066W0009)</placekey>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; Puerto Rico &gt; Salinas &gt; Jobos Bay (Bahia de Jobos) (17N066W0009)</placekey>    </place>   </keywords>   <accconst>None</accconst>   <useconst>Please reference NOAA/NOS/NCCOS/CCMA/Biogeography Branch when utilizing these data in a report or peer reviewed publication.

Sites were randomly selected and stratified by habitat types using NOAA's benthic habitat maps of Puerto Rico.</complete>   <lineage>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Once in the field, the boat captain navigates to previously selected sites using a handheld GPS unit. On-site, divers are deployed and maintain contact with each other throughout the entire census. One diver is responsible for collecting data on the fish communities utilizing the belt-transect visual census technique over an area of 100m2 (25m length X 4m width). The belt-transect diver obtains a random compass heading for the transect prior to entering the water and records the compass bearing (0-360o) on the data sheet.  Visibility at each site must be sufficient to allow for identification of fish at a minimum of 2m away. Once reasonable visibility is ascertained, the diver attaches a tape measure to the substrate and allows it to roll out for 25m while they are collecting data. Although the habitat should not be altered in any manner by lifting or moving structure, the observer should record fish seen in holes, under ledges and in the water column. To identify, enumerate, or locate new individuals, divers may move off the centerline of the transect as long as they stay within the 4m transect width and do not look back along area already covered. The diver is allowed to look forward toward the end of the transect for the distance remaining (i.e. if the diver is at meter 15, he can look 10 meters distant, but if he is at meter 23, he can only look 2 meters ahead). On-site, no attempt to avoid structural features within a habitat such as a sand patch or an anchor should be made as these features affect fish communities and are \"real\" component of the habitats. The only two instances where the transect should deviate from the designated path is to stay above 110 ft (limitations imposed by diving) or while surveying mangrove habitats. In mangrove areas, the diver swims close to the prop roots and looks as far into the mangroves as possible; up to 2m and then out to the edge of the mangrove overhang such that the total area surveyed is still 100m2. In this case, some of the survey may necessarily fall on seagrass habitat. This is allowed as the mangrove habitat is defined as a transition zone habitat. The transect should take 15 minutes regardless of habitat type or number of animals present. This allows more mobile animals the opportunity to swim through the transect, and standardizes the samples collected to allow for comparisons. Data are collected on the following: 1) Logistic information - diver name, dive buddy, date, time of survey, site code, transect bearing. 2) Taxa presence - as the tape roles out at a relatively constant speed, the diver records all fish species to the lowest taxonomic level possible that come within 2m of either side of the transect. To decrease the total time spent writing, four letter codes are used that consist of the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name. In the rare case that two species have the same four-letter code, letters are added to the species name until a difference occurs. If the fish can only be identified to the family or genus level then this is all that is recorded. If the fish cannot be identified to the family level then no entry is necessary. 3) Abundance &amp; size - the number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length. If an individual is greater than 35cm, then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded. 4) Photos - individuals too difficult to identify or unique in some manner may be photographed for later clarification.</procdesc>     <procdate>200906</procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <geograph>     <latres>0.00001</latres>     <longres>0.00001</longres>     <geogunit>Decimal degrees</geogunit>    </geograph>   </horizsys>  </spref>  <eainfo>   <overview>    <eaover>We supply abundance and size information of fish species at the lowest possible taxonomic level.
