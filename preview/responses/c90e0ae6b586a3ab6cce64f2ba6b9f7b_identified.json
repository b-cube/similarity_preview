The NHHD, developed at 1:24,000 scale, is an extract from the high-resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) housed at the US Geological Survey.  The NHHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, stream orders and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the the Atlantic Ocean. The NHHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. </abstract> <purpose> The NHHD complies with the national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities, and any associated information about them, can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all. </purpose> <supplinf> The following files were obtained from the USGS National Hydrography Dataset website, and are provided with the data.

The primary data source for assigning stream orders to the 1:24,000-scale vector flowlines was the USGS digital line graphs (DLGs), representing blue line features on the 1:24,000-scale topographic maps.  Given the acknowledged inaccuracies in the attribution of intermittent versus  perennial hydrographic features as depicted on these maps,  all blue line features were included as part of the drainage network and subject to ordering.  This approach is consistent with the Strahler method as originally proposed.  However, some of these data were subsequently modified in an attempt to account for known differences in drainage density in limited areas of the state where density differences could reasonably be attributed to cartographic representation by the DLGs and not physical differences in geology and/or hydrology.  Specifically, areas where DLGs were digitized from provisional 1:25,000-scale 7.5x15-minute metric source maps exhibited a significantly higher drainage density than contiguous areas.  Strahler stream order is very sensitive to drainage density and the overall consistency with which blue line features are defined and mapped.  To enforce consistency in drainage density in those areas with provisional map coverage, the drainage network was systematically \\ufffd\\ufffdpruned\\ufffd\\ufffd based on an empirical upstream drainage area threshold value that was representative of the initiation points (network starts) of blue line features in neighboring areas.  Ordering was performed on the \\ufffd\\ufffdpruned\\ufffd\\ufffd network in these areas.  The resulting order values represent the best characterization possible given the limitations in the currency, accuracy and resolution of the source data, and serve the expressed goal of providing a meaningful parameter that can support hydrologic assessments of relative stream discharge and classifications of channel geometry.  The 1:24,000-scale flowline network has not been subject to rigorous ground-truthing and, therefore, is subject to significant errors of omission, inclusion, and connectivity.   Users of these data should be aware that any such error has the potential to significantly affect the stream order of downstream reaches. Furthermore, errors in the network have been discovered since the ordering was completed and additional errors are likely to be identified over time as more and more users with local hydrographic knowledge reference the dataset.   The vector flowlines will be revised accordingly, but no plan exists to maintain the associated stream order attributes to be consistent with modified geometry.   Significant differences exist between stream orders as assigned in this dataset and those assigned in an earlier version (1995) by the NH Office of State Planning (now the Office of Energy and Planning).  Users should carefully consider their objectives when deciding which dataset to reference, given that some limitations apply in both cases. An understanding of the specific data sources and methods, as documented above and in the accompanying metadata records, is critical for appropriate application of the stream order dataset. </useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntorgp> <cntorg>Complex Systems Research Center, University of New Hampshire</cntorg> <cntper>GRANIT Database Manager</cntper> </cntorgp> <cntpos>GRANIT Database Manager</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype> <address>Morse Hall, University of New Hampshire</address> <city>Durham</city> <state>NH</state> <postal>03824</postal> <country>US</country> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>603-862-1792</cntvoice> <cntfax>603-862-0188</cntfax> <cntemail>granit@unh.edu</cntemail> <hours>8:30AM-5PM, EST</hours> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <browse> <browsen>&lt;URL:http://www.granit.sr.unh.edu/cgi-bin/load_file?PATH=/data/database/d-webdata/nhhd/browse.gif&gt;</browsen> <browsed>gif image file</browsed> <browset>GIF</browset> </browse> <datacred>GRANIT database</datacred> <native>ArcGIS 9.x</native> <crossref> <citeinfo> <origin>New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services</origin> <pubdate>Unknown</pubdate> <title>New Hampshire Geological Survey</title> <pubinfo> <pubplace>Concord, NH</pubplace> <publish>New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services</publish> </pubinfo> <onlink>http://www.des.state.nh.us</onlink> </citeinfo> </crossref> </idinfo> <dataqual> <attracc> <attraccr> One or more of the following methods were used to test attribute accuracy of the source USGS Digital Line Graph data: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen. In addition, software validated feature types (FCODEs) and characteristics against a master set of types and characteristics, checked that combinations of types and characteristics were valid, and that types and characteristics were valid for the delineation of the feature.  Feature types, characteristics, and other attributes conform to the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset (USGS, 1999) as of the date they were loaded into the database. All names were validated against a current extract from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). The entry and identifier for the names match those in the GNIS. The association of each name to reaches has been interactively checked, however, operator error could in some cases apply a name to a wrong reach. </attraccr> </attracc> <logic> Points, nodes, lines, and areas conform to topological rules. Lines intersect only at nodes, and all nodes anchor the ends of lines. Lines do not overshoot or undershoot other lines where they are supposed to meet. There are no duplicate lines. Lines bound areas and lines identify the areas to the left and right of the lines. Gaps and overlaps among areas do not exist. All areas close. </logic> <complete> Data is complete for the hydrologic cataloging unit.  The completeness of the data reflects the content of the source (the published USGS topographic quadrangles). The USGS topographic quadrangle is usually supplemented by Digital Orthophoto Quadrangles (DOQs). Features found on the ground may have been eliminated or generalized on the source map because of scale and legibility constraints. In general, streams longer than one mile (approximately 1.6 kilometers) were collected. Most streams that flow from a lake were collected regardless of their length. Only definite channels were collected so not all swamp/marsh features have stream/rivers delineated through them. Lake/ponds having an area greater than 6 acres were collected. Note, however, that these general rules were applied unevenly among maps during compilation. Reach codes are defined on all features of type stream/river, canal/ditch, artificial path, coastline, and connector. Waterbody reach codes are defined on all lake/pond and most reservoir features. Names were applied from the GNIS database. Detailed capture conditions are provided for every feature type in the Standards for National Hydrography Dataset available online through &lt;http://mapping.usgs.gov/standards/&gt;. </complete> <posacc> <horizpa> <horizpar> Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features. </horizpar> </horizpa> <vertacc> <vertaccr> Statements of vertical positional accuracy for elevation of water surfaces are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For vertical accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within one-half contour interval of the correct value. Elevations of water surface printed on the published map meet this standard; the contour intervals of the maps vary. These elevations were transcribed into the digital data; the accuracy of this transcription was checked by visual comparison between the data and the map. </vertaccr> </vertacc> </posacc> <lineage>

DLG files were converted to ArcInfo coverages and projected to the New Hampshire State Plane coordinate system (NHSP NAD83 Feet).  Attributes were standardized to ensure consistent number of MAJOR/MINOR pairs.  Attributes were also verified, using one or more of the following methods: manual comparison of the source with hardcopy plots; symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive computer graphic system; selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.  The DLG coverages were edgematched using a 40 foot snapping tolerance.  Features outside the tolerance were not moved; instead, a feature of type connector was added to join the features. </procdesc> <srcused>USGS1</srcused> <procdate>2000</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> Pre-conflation: Using a suite of tools provided by the USGS, the DLG quads for each 11-digit CU were paneled into one coverage and arcs within 40 feet of each other along the neatline were again snapped together if the feature types were the same.  Next, the 11-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) boundary was used to extract features from the paneled coverage that fell within the boundary. Next, arcs from the extracted coverage were grouped in order to examine the connectivity of the dataset for flow determination. In some cases it was necessary to correct digitizing errors.  Using contour lines from the New Hampshire Digital Raster Graphics, lines called connectors were added to join features that were deemed to have flow between each other.  All arcs were directed downstream and the nodes were prepared to help create artificial paths through 2-D waterbodies and complete the flow through the hydrography network.  The artificial path coverage was combined with the single line stream network to create the drainage network.  The drainage network was grouped again, and each group was directed downstream.  The data was then appended to conform to the 8-digit CU boundaries.  Feature codes (fcodes) were assigned to network and waterbody features through a crosswalk that converts DLG-3 attributes to fcodes, where an fcode is a five digit integer that encodes a set of feature type characteristics.  At ths point, all spatial and attribute data were QC&apos;d by staff at both CSRC and the NH Department of Environmental Services.  Conflation/Post-conflation: Reach codes and associated attributes were conflated from the 100K NHD data to the 24K drainage network and 2-D waterbodies. Several checks were performed to validate the reach transfer process. Any reach codes that could not be maintained are tracked in the Reach Cross Reference table. New reaches that do not exist in the 100K data were defined according to reach delineation rules (See http://nhd.usgs.gov/chapter1/index.html). New waterbody reaches were assigned to 2-D lake/pond and reservoir features that do not exist in the 100K NHD.  New reaches were assigned reach code values that are sequentially ordered to 2-D and then 1-D reaches. New 24K reach codes are larger than any existing 100K reach code in the associated Catalog Unit. Additional Geographic Names that exist in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) were added to reaches in the 24K dataset. Names for the 24K drainage network were interactively transferred from the vector GNIS coverage. Additional GNIS names for waterbody features were also added. </procdesc> <srcused>NRCS, USGS1, USGS2, USGS3, USGS4</srcused> <procdate>20030421</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> Due to a higher feature density resulting from a smaller mapping scale in Southwest NH and the White Mountain National Forest, the stream network generated from pre-conflation in these areas was &quot;pruned&quot; prior to the stream ordering process.  This was accomplished through the following steps using ArcInfo and Grid tools: - Burned the stream network into a Digital Elevation Model. - Ran the FLOW ACCUMULATION command using a threshold value that produced a rasterized stream network matching the 1:24000 scale stream density representative of the majority of the state. - The grid resulting from the FLOW ACCUMULATION was visually compared to the stream network in the high density areas to determine which streams would not receive a stream order.  Streams that were not to be ordered were retained in the data, but were &quot;pruned&quot; by assigning a flag value. </procdesc> <srcused>USGS1,USGS5</srcused> <procdate>2000</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> Using the Strahler method, stream orders were manually assigned to the &quot;pruned&quot; pre-conflation data using ArcEdit tools.  The following additional rules were applied to the stream ordering process: - Artificial paths in lakes and reservoirs received the value of the outflowing stream.  The out flowing stream (and artificial paths) were coded one order higher if two streams of the same order flowed into the waterbody. - Divergent paths received the order of the stream immediately upstream from the divergent path.  Stream order only increased if a tributary of higher or equal order flowed into a divergent path. - Features that did not receive a stream order were &quot;pruned&quot; streams, coastline arcs and pipelines. - Streams that originate in tidal wetlands were coded as first order streams. Stream orders were QC&apos;d by staff at CSRC and NHDES. </procdesc> <srcused>USGS1</srcused> <procdate>2005</procdate> </procstep> <procstep> <procdesc> Once the NHD was certified and downloaded from USGS, the streams orders were spatially joined and transferred to the NHDFlowline feature class. However, due to spatial edits to the NHD during the conflation process, the stream order data required editing to spatially match the NHD before the attribute could be transferred.  Modifications were made in ArcGIS, using standard editing tools. </procdesc> <srcused>USGS1</srcused> <procdate>2006</procdate> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <direct>Vector</direct> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <planar> <gridsys> <gridsysn>State Plane Coordinate System 1983</gridsysn> <spcs> <spcszone>2800</spcszone> <transmer> <sfctrmer>0.999967</sfctrmer> <longcm>-71.666667</longcm> <latprjo>42.500000</latprjo> <feast>984250.000000</feast> <fnorth>0.000000</fnorth> </transmer> </spcs> </gridsys> <planci> <plance>coordinate pair</plance> <coordrep> <absres>0.000512</absres> <ordres>0.000512</ordres> </coordrep> <plandu>survey feet</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>North American Datum of 1983</horizdn> <ellips>Geodetic Reference System 80</ellips> <semiaxis>6378137.000000</semiaxis> <denflat>298.257222</denflat> </geodetic> </horizsys> </spref> <eainfo> <detailed> <enttyp> <enttypl>NHDFlowline</enttypl> <enttypd>stream network</enttypd> <enttypds>None</enttypds> </enttyp> <attr> <attrlabl>STREAMORDER</attrlabl> <attrdef>Stahler stream orders</attrdef> <attrdefs>CSRC/NHDES</attrdefs> <attrdomv> <edom> <edomv>1</edomv> <edomvd>first order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>2</edomv> <edomvd>second order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>3</edomv> <edomvd>third order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>4</edomv> <edomvd>fourth order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>5</edomv> <edomvd>fifth order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>6</edomv> <edomvd>sixth order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>7</edomv> <edomvd>seventh order stream</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>-97</edomv> <edomvd>pipeline - no stream order</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>-98</edomv> <edomvd>coastline - no stream order</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES</edomvds> </edom> <edom> <edomv>-99</edomv> <edomvd>&quot;pruned&quot; - no stream order</edomvd> <edomvds>CSRC/NHDES (see process steps)</edomvds> </edom> </attrdomv> </attr> </detailed> <overview> <eaover> The New Hampshire Hydrography Dataset is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that encodes information about naturally occurring and constructed bodies of water, paths through which water flows, and related entities. The information encoded about features includes a feature date, classification by type, other characteristics, a unique common identifier, the feature length or area, and (rarely) elevation of the surface of water pools and a description of the stage of the elevation. For reaches, encoded information includes a reach code. Names and their identifiers in the Geographic Names Information System, are assigned to most feature types. The direction of flow is encoded for networked features. The data also contains relations that encode metadata, and information that supports the exchange of future updates and improvements to the data.
