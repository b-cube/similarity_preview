It lies in the valley of the River Thune, close to sea level, and is connected to the river by an artificial channel approximately 0.7km long. The broad is subject to a small tidal variation in water height, and is brackish. It is part of a National Nature Reserve, owned and managed by the Norfolk Wildlife Trust. The broad is surrounded by extensive areas of reed bed and grazing marsh, although parts of the catchment have been deep-drained for arable cultivation. Geologically, the areas is underlain by Quaternary deposits of Norwich Crag, with glacial till and outwash deposits at the surface. The lake is used extensively for recreational activities - sailing, windsurfing, tourist cruisers and angling. The broad is not subject to any point sources of nutrient input, and has maintained a substantial aquatic macrophyte population in recent years, although there have been signs of eutrophication.

It is situated about 35km north of Edinburgh at an altitude of 107m. It has a surface area of 13.3km2 and has a mean depth of 3.9m. The Loch Leven catchment covers 145 km<sup>2</sup>, consisting mainly of arable crops (38.6%) and improved pasture (31.5%), but also upland moor (11.6%), coniferous woodland (3.8%), heathland (3.5%), rough grazing (3.5%), suburban/rural development (2.2%) and the rest - deciduous woodland, bog, bare ground, inland water - (5.3%). The highest part of the catchment is at 497m.</p> <p>Loch Leven is particularly renowned for its large numbers of migratory, breeding and overwintering waterfowl and its world famous brown trout fishery. It is a Site for Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a National Nature Reserve (NNR), a Special Protected Area (SPA) and a Ramsar site. Loch Leven is also a water supply source for downstream paper mills and textile factories. Although the overall quality of the site is good, the loch has suffered from periodic cyanobacterial (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdblue-green algal\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd) blooms for many years. These have occurred, largely, as a result of substantial amounts of phosphorus entering the loch, combined with a relatively low flushing rate and a favourable light-climate. The blooms have a direct impact on the various users of the loch, on the local economy, and occasionally pose a potential risk to human health. In terms of conservation interest, algal blooms also reduce light penetration into the water, reducing macrophyte (aquatic plant) growth, with associated impacts on macroinvertebrate, fish and the significant bird communities.</p> <p>The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and its various predecessor bodies have been monitoring the lake since the mid 1960\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds and have built up long-term data sets of various biological and chemical parameters.

They have markedly different catchments - the Falloch's is mountainous  with a catchment area of 80km<sup>2</sup>, whilst the Endrick's is a typical lowland rural catchment of 220km<sup>2</sup>.  There are distinct differences in the chemistry of the two rivers,  reflecting the differences in the geology of their catchments. The  Highland Boundary fault cuts across the lower part of Loch Lomond, but  there is also a narrow physical restriction halfway down the length of  the loch. For these reasons, the water chemistry and topography are  quite different between the so-called Northern and Southern Basins and,  as a result, there are two ECN sampling sites, one from each basin.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-01T13:59:14Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/lochnagar\">     <title>Lochnagar</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/lochnagar</link>     <description>The Lochnagar ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Lochnagar lies at an altitude of 785 m in the centre of the granite massif which comprises much of Balmoral Forest.

The precipitous catchment (91.9 ha) is composed of biotite granite, overlain in places by blanket peat, but dominated by bare rock with extensive fields of large boulders and coarse screes. The sparse moorland vegetation of the catchment is dominated by a community of stunted <i>Calluna </i>(heather) and <i>Vaccinium </i>(bilberry).

The Upper Lough and the shallower regions of Lower Lough Erne  present an example of a flooded drumlin landscape which has created an  intricate mosaic of land and water. As a consequence of differences in  depth and area, the water retention time of the Upper Lough is less than  one month while that of the Lower Lough is four months. Passing from  the shallow Upper Lough (mean depth 2.3m) and through Lower Lough Erne  (mean depth 11.9m), phytoplankton abundance is reduced and algal  composition alters, as do nutrient and temperature cycles. Phosphorus  concentrations (100 mg P l-1) in the Upper  Lough create eutrophic conditions, with high summer chlorophyll a  concentrations, but phytoplankton abundance in the deep open water of  the Lower Lough is more typical of a mesotrophic water body despite  comparatively high phosphorus concentrations (60 mg  P l-1). The paucity of phytoplankton in this region is attributed to a  high back-ground light attenuation from the peat-stained water and the  greater depth of the mixed water zone (&gt;35m). The lake supports a  fish population dominated by a recent introduction, the roach, as well  as pike, perch, bream, trout and the pollan (Coregonus autumnalis pollan  Thompson). The Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) is a recent  introduction (1996) which now has only a limited distribution in the  Lower Lough.    As this species expands its range and abundance  throughout the Erne system, it may impact significantly on the lake  ecology. Water monitoring is undertaken at the deepest portion of Lower  Lough Erne with limited samples taken along a gradient towards the main  river inflow of the lake.</p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>View <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://data.ecn.ac.uk/ukleon/\">near real-time data from UKLEON Automatic monitoring buoys</a> (there is a buoy on this lake).</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-01T14:05:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/lough-neagh\">     <title>Lough Neagh</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/lough-neagh</link>     <description>The Lough Neagh ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Lough Neagh covers 386 km2 and is by far the largest area of freshwater in the British Isles. Situated in north-east Ireland, it has a drainage basin of 4450 km2, which is shared between Northern Ireland (91%) and the Republic of Ireland (9%). The average water retention time is 15 months. Although large in area, the lake is relatively shallow with a mean depth of 8.9m (max. 25 m). This, combined with its great size and a mild and windy oceanic climate, ensures that the water column is generally well mixed. The lake supports commercial fisheries for eels, pollan (<i>Coregonus autumnalis pollan</i> Thompson), perch and trout of which the eel fishery is the most significant, with an annual catch in the region of 600 t. Lough Neagh is hypertrophic with a mean annual total phosphorus concentration of 160 mg P l-1. Attempts to lower P concentrations in the lough by curtailing point sources of P have been unsuccessful due to increasing inputs from diffuse sources. Levels of P in the lough support large phytoplankton populations with annual chlorophyll a concentrations typically in excess of 60 mg l-1. The dominant alga is the cyanophyte <i>Planktothrix agardhii</i> (Komarek) Anagnostides and the phytoplankton is now less diverse than in the late 1960s when regular monitoring began. Since then there has been regular monitoring of the plankton, lake and river nutrient concentrations, which have been used to produce nutrient budgets for the lake.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-01T14:35:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/scoat-tarn\">     <title>Scoat Tarn</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/scoat-tarn</link>     <description>The Scoat Tarn ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Scoat Tarn in the English Lake District is a typical mountain corrie lake, being small and deep with an area of 5.2 ha and a maximum depth of 20 m. The lake lies in a west facing valley at an altitude of 602 m, and drains into Wastwater via the Nether Beck. The catchment comprises a small corrie (95 ha) with steeply sloping walls and three summits in excess of 825 m. The bedrock is Ordivician tuff (undifferentiated) of the Borrowdale Volcanic series and the local soils are mainly shallow, peaty rankers. The eastern slopes are mainly of rock and boulders while to the north are less steep and covered in rough grass and Sphagnum moss. Land use is confined to low intensity sheep grazing. Scoat Tarn has been shown by palaeoecological assessment to have acidified severely as a direct result of\\ufffd\\ufffdhuman-induced acid deposition. Monitoring by the UK Upland Waters Monitoring Network shows the site is now in the process of chemical recovery, with a substantial decline in inorganic aluminium and a slight increase in pH over the last two decades.</p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-02T10:35:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/upton-broad\">     <title>Upton Broad</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/upton-broad</link>     <description>The Upton Broad ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Upton Broad is a shallow lowland lake, formed by the flooding of peat diggings, which were abandoned in the 14<sup>th</sup> century. It has an area of 6.9ha and an approximate mean depth of 0.8m. The broad lies in the valley of the River Bure, at an elevation of less than 10m, but is isolated from the river system, and is groundwater fed, with some drainage from surrounding land. Geologically, the areas is underlain by Quaternary deposits of Norwich Crag, with glacial till and outwash deposits at the surface. The broad forms part of the Upton Broad and Marshes SSSI. It is considered to have been relatively unaffected by the eutrophication that has damaged most of the lakes in the region, and supports a population of the nationally rare aquatic macrophyte <i>Najas marina</i>. The broad is surrounded by a band of alder carr (wet woodland). To the north of the broad are drained grazing marshes forming part of the Broads ESA, and to the south the catchment is given over to the more intensive arable agriculture. The broad is used for angling by a private club; there is no other public access to the lake.</p> <h3>See also:</h3> <ul> <li><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"hickling-broad\">Hickling\\ufffd\\ufffdBroad</a> </li> <li><a class=\"internal\" href=\"wroxham-broad\">Wroxham Broad</a></li> <li><a class=\"internal\" href=\"../rivers/bure\">River Bure</a>\\ufffd\\ufffd</li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-02T11:35:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/windermere\">     <title>Windermere</title>     <link>http://www.ecn.ac.uk/sites/site/lakes/windermere</link>     <description>The Windermere ECN site</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Windermere lies in the north-west corner of England in the English Lake District, an area of great natural beauty which has been a tourist destination since the Romantic Revival of the 18c.</p> <p>The dominant geological structure of the Lake District is a dome of Paleozoic rocks formed by uplift in the Tertiary. This uplift produced a radial drainage pattern which was enhanced during the Pleistocene glaciation, with the major lakes occupying bedrock basins in steep-sided, flat-floored valleys. Windermere is the largest natural lake in England having a surface area of 14.8km<sup>2</sup> at an altitude of only 40 m. The lake itself is divided by a shallow sill into two basins; the North Basin with a surface area of 8km<sup>2</sup> and maximum depth of 64m and the South Basin with a surface area of 6.7km<sup>2</sup> and maximum depth of 42m.</p> <p>The North basin of Windermere, which is the ECN sampling site (2<sup>o</sup>58'W 54<sup>o</sup>23'N), has a catchment of 180km<sup>2</sup> which drains into the lake via two main rivers, several small tarns (lakes) and several streams. The catchment is mainly hill land, grazed by sheep throughout the year but also used intensively for recreational purposes. The villages in the valleys are also major tourist destinations with consequent increases in the sewage input to the lake. Over the past 50 years levels of dissolved reactive phosphorus in the lake have more than doubled, reaching their highest levels in the 1980s. The effluent discharged into the North Basin of Windermere from the main sewage works is now Phosphate stripped in an effort to reduce the nutrient loading to the lake.</p> <ul> <li>Surface area:14.8km<sup>2 </sup>(total); 8km<sup>2</sup> (North Basin); 6.7km<sup>2</sup> (South Basin)</li> <li>Maximum depth: 64m (North Basin); 42m (South Basin)</li> <li>Altitude: 40 m</li> <li>Location of ECN sampling site: 2<sup>o</sup>58'W 54<sup>o</sup>23'N</li> <li>North Basin catchment size: 180km<sup>2</sup></li> </ul> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>View <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://data.ecn.ac.uk/ukleon/\">near real-time data from UKLEON Automatic monitoring buoys</a> (there is a buoy on this lake).</p> <ul> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>admin</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>     <dc:date>2011-08-02T10:50:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Site</dc:type>   </item>      </rdf:RDF> ",
