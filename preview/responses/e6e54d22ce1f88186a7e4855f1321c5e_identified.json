The applicable existing standards track MIBs are then    examined.  Finally, an analysis of the additional groups of MIB    attributes that are needed to meet the requirements is presented. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (2.) --> <section title=\"Overview\"> <t>    The World Wide Web (WWW) is a network of information, accessible via    a simple easy to use interface.  The information is often presented    in HyperText or multi-media.  The information is provided by servers    which are located all around the world.  The usability of the web    depends largely on the performance of these servers. WWW servers are    typically monitored through log files.  This becomes a difficult task    when a single organization is responsible for a number of servers.    Since many organizations currently use the Internet Standard SNMP to    manage their network devices, it is desirable to treat these WWW    servers as additional devices within this framework. This will allow    a single Network Management Station (NMS) to automate the management    of a number of WWW servers as well as the entire enterprise. Defining    a standard for this purpose allows a single management application to    manage a number of servers from a variety of vendors.  Additionally,    a formal definition of what has to be managed and how to manage it    tends to lead to integrated and improved performance and fault    management. </t> <t>    Content providers are interested in the access statistics and    configuration of their sites. The content provider may be the same or    a different organization than the one that maintains the server as a    whole. It may be possible to realize the new paradigm of &quot;Customer    Network Management&quot; to provide this information to the content    provider. This means that there exists a distinct organization    different than the network operations center that is also interested    in the management information from a device. Customer network    management is desirable to allow each content provider on a server to    access information about his own documents independent of the rest. </t> <t>    Various organizations may be interested in SNMP manageable WWW    clients and proxies as well. At this time, our focus is on WWW    servers. A natural extension to this work could be a framework for    managing WWW Clients and general information retrieval systems like    WWW proxies, NNTP, GOPHER, FTP and WAIS.  The focus of this document    remains the management of WWW servers. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.) --> <section title=\"Requirements\"> <t>    WWW servers can be viewed from several perspectives when assigning    management responsibilities.  For the sake of discussion, these    perspectives are named the Operational Model and the Service Model.    The Operational Model views WWW servers as computers with hardware,    disk, OS and web server software.  This model represents the actual    resources that make up the machine so that it can be monitored from    the perspective of resource utilization.  The Service Model views the    WWW server as a black box that simply handles the responses to    requests from clients located on the web. </t> <t>    The two models compliment each other while providing distinct    information about the server.  Members of the organization    responsible for the WWW server, may be interested in one and/or both    of the management models.  For this reason, the management    information should be scalable, for one or both models to be    implemented independent of the other. </t> <t>    With this in mind, the requirements for WWW server management can are    summarized below by expanding upon those generated at the HTTP-MIB    BOF. </t> <!-- RFC original section: (3.1) --> <section title=\"Operational Model Requirements\"> <t> </t> <!-- RFC original section: (3.1.1.) --> <section title=\"Host specific and Application Monitoring\"> <t>    This includes monitoring the utilization of CPU, disk and network    capacity. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.1.2.) --> <section title=\"Dependencies among applications.\"> <t>    Some systems implement a number of services within a single piece of    code. Others use multiple pieces of code to implement the same set of    services. Because of this, dependencies develop among processes.    These dependencies become critical when a particular process needs to    be stopped, restarted or reconfigured. These dependencies need to be    defined within the management information so that management    applications can operate the systems correctly. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.1.3.) --> <section title=\"Error generation and reporting\"> <t>    The WWW server generally reports errors via logging facilities.  The    format of the log file is not well defined.  It is required that a    standard facility for error reporting be utilized. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.1.4.) --> <section title=\"Capacity planning\"> <t>    It is required to obtain statistics which can be used for capacity    planning purposes. This includes planning for increased network    bandwidth, computing power, disk space, number of concurrent server    threads, etc. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.1.5.) --> <section title=\"Log Digester\"> <t>    WWW servers generally report status information by data generated in    Common Log Format <xref target=\"_XREF_1\"/>.  This information needs to be preserved as    attributes in a MIB to facilitate remote monitoring providing a    standard way to represent and retrieve the management information. </t> </section> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.2.) --> <section title=\"Service Model Requirements\"> <t> </t> <!-- RFC original section: (3.2.1.) --> <section title=\"Retrieval services\"> <t>    Retrieval services are an abstract decoupling the information space    from the underlying transport mechanism.  The goal at this time is to    focus on the requirements for management of WWW servers. There may be    considerable overlap with other types of servers like (FTP, NNTP,    GOPHER and WAIS).  The term &quot;retrieval services&quot; is used here to    retain this abstraction.  It is required to get statistics about the    usage and performance of the retrieval services. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.2.2.) --> <section title=\"Document information store -- managing documents.\"> <t>    Information from a WWW server can be static (a file) or dynamic (the    output of some processing).  Management of these two types of    information sources range from maintaining access statistics and    access permissions to verifying the operational status of all    applications that provide the dynamic information. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.2.3.) --> <section title=\"Server configuration.\"> <t>    It is desirable to be able to centralize configuration management of    the servers within an enterprise. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.2.4.) --> <section title=\"Server Control.\"> <t>    WWW servers generally need to be controlled in regards to starting    and stopping them as well as rotating log files. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (3.2.5.) --> <section title=\"Quality of Service\"> <t>    Provide an indication of the quality of service the WWW server is    providing. </t> </section> </section> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (4.) --> <section title=\"Relationship to existing IETF efforts\"> <t>    In general, a WWW server is made up of or depends upon the following    components: <list> <t>       -a general purpose workstation running some operating system </t> <t>       -http server software to answers requests from the network </t> <t>       -various support routines like CGI programs or external        applications (like DBMS) used to access information </t> <t>       -a document store on one or more storage devices </t></list> </t> <t>    The health and performance of each of the above components is of    interest when managing a WWW server. </t> <t>    There are a number of standards track MIB modules that are of    interest to the above list of items.  This list includes MIB-II <xref target=\"_XREF_2\"/>,    Host Resources MIB <xref target=\"_XREF_3\"/>, Network Service Monitoring MIB <xref target=\"_XREF_4\"/> and    Application MIB <xref target=\"_XREF_5\"/>. </t> <t>    This creates an impressive list of attributes to be implemented.  A    definition of various levels of management of a WWW server is desired    so that the implementor may scale his implementation in chunks which    may include various components of each section.  For instance, this    may allow customer network management without requiring the other    groups being implemented. </t> <!-- RFC original section: (4.1.) --> <section title=\"MIB-II [2]\"> <t>    MIB-II defines the managed objects which should be contained within    TCP/IP based devices. </t> <t>    The WWW server should support the applicable portions of MIB-II.    This set probably includes, as a minimum, the following groups:    system, interfaces, udp, icmp, tcp and snmp. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (4.2.) --> <section title=\"Host Resources MIB [3]\"> <t>    This MIB defines a uniform set of objects useful for the management    of host computers independently of the operating system, network    services, or any software application. </t> <t>    The MIB is structured as six groups; each specified as either    &quot;mandatory&quot; or &quot;optional&quot;.  If ANY &quot;optional&quot; group of the MIB is    implemented, then ALL &quot;mandatory&quot; groups of the MIB must also be    implemented.  This may cause implementation problems for some    developers since many of these attributes require intimate knowledge    of the OS. </t> <t>    The groups defined by the MIB are: </t> <figure><artwork>       -System Group                           Mandatory       -Storage Group                          Mandatory       -Device Group                           Mandatory                  -device types                 -device table                 -processor table                 -network table                 -printer table                 -disk storage table                 -partition table                 -file-system table                 -file-system types       -Running Software Group                 Optional       -Running Software Performance Group     Optional       -Installed Software Group               Optional </artwork></figure> <t>    The system group provides general status information about the host.    The storage and device groups define the information about the    configuration and status of the resources which compose the host.  It    defines the resources which make up a generic host system and how    they relate to each other.  Much of this information is useful for    managing various aspects of a WWW server, like the file system and    CPU utilization.  This information is useful for meeting the    operational requirements. Much of this information is however more    detailed than many WWW server managers require for service level    requirements. </t> <t>    The remaining groups define software components which are installed    and/or running on the host.  Performance information is defined which    extends that defined for each running process.  Unfortunately, the    mapping between running software and installed software is difficult    since it is related by a foreign key (Product ID) which does not    appear to be required to exist in either table <xref target=\"_XREF_6\"/>. There is no    provision to represent a group of processes which together perform    some task (IE an application made up of multiple processes). The    Applications MIB WG plans to address these deficiencies. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (4.3.) --> <section title=\"Network Services Monitoring MIB [4]\"> <t>    This MIB is one of three documents produced by the MADMAN (Message    And Directory MANagement) Working group.  It defines a set of general    purpose attributes which would be appropriate for a range of    applications that provide network services.  This definition is from    the perspective of the service without considering the implementation    in terms of host computers or processes.  Attributes provide </t> <t>    statistics and status on the in-bound and out-bound associations that    are currently active, and which have been active. </t> <t>    This MIB is intended to be the minimum set of attributes common    across a number of Network Service Applications.  Additional    attributes are to be defined as necessary to manage specific network    service applications.  WWW servers clearly fall into the category of    network service applications.  All attributes in this MIB are    relevant to WWW servers. </t> <t>    The MIB consists of two tables: </t> <figure><artwork>            -applTable                  Mandatory            -assocTable                 Optional </artwork></figure> <t>    The applTable describes applications that provide network services    and keeps statistics of the current number of active associations and    the total number of associations since application initialization.    The assocTable contains more detailed information about active    associations. </t> <t>    The other two MIBs defined by MADMAN, MTA MIB <xref target=\"_XREF_7\"/> and DSA MIB <xref target=\"_XREF_8\"/>,    are not relevant to the management of WWW services.  They do,    however, demonstrate how to extend the Network Services Monitoring    MIB for a specific set of applications. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (4.4.) --> <section title=\"Application MIB [5]\"> <t>    The Application MIB WG is defining two separate MIBs: the sysApplMib    and the applMib.  The first defines attributes that can be monitored    without instrumenting the applications.  The second will define    additional attributes requiring application instrumentation. </t> <t>    The sysApplMIB allows for the description of applications as a    collection of executables, and files installed and executing on a    host computer. The objects support configuration, fault and    performance management of some of the basic attributes of application    software. </t> <t>    The groups defined in the sysApplMIB are: </t> <figure><artwork>            -System Application Installed Group     Mandatory                    -sysApplInstalledTable                    -sysApplCfgElmtTable             -System Application Run Group           Mandatory                    -sysApplRunTable                    -SysApplPastRunTable                    -sysApplElmtRunTable                    -sysApplElmtPastRunTable </artwork></figure> <t>    The sysApplInstalledTable captures what applications are installed on    a particular host and the sysApplCfgElmtTable provides information    regarding the executables and non executable files which collectively    compose the application. The sysApplRunTable contains the application    instances which are currently running and the sysApplPastRunTable    contains a history about applications which have previously executed    on the host. The sysApplElmtRunTable contains the process instances    which are currently running and sysApplElmtPastRunTable contains a    history about processes which have previously executed on the host. </t> <t>    It should be noted that two implementations of the same set of    network services may each define a different set of processes and    files within this MIB.  Ultimately enough management information is    needed so that these different implementations can at least be    managed similarly. </t> <t>    WWW servers fall into the general category of application software.    Therefore the attributes of this MIB are applicable if the process    level detail is requested to meet the Operational Model requirements. </t> <t>    The Application MIB WG is to resolve the problems described above    with the relationship between the running and installed software of    the Host Resources MIB. </t> </section> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (5.) --> <section title=\"Summary of Existing Standards Track MIBs\"> <t>    The existing MIBs are largely orthogonal as demonstrated by the    diagram below.  Host Resources relates network information to the    interfaces defined in MIB-II.  The system application MIB relates its    running element table to the equivalent entry in the Host Resources    running software table. </t> <t>    It should be noted that the running software of the Host Resources    includes ALL software running on the host, while the running element    table of the system application MIB only includes &quot;interesting&quot;    processes of monitored applications. </t> <t>    In the diagram below, &quot;Other Services&quot;, &quot;Application Specific MIBs&quot;    and &quot;Application MIB&quot; represent work to be done or in progress. </t> <figure><artwork>                           +---------------+                           |  Application  |                           | Specific MIBs |                           +---------------+                                  |   +--------+ +---+ +---+  +---------------+   |Other   | |MTA| |DSA|  |  Application  |   |services| |MIB| |MIB|  |      MIB      |   +--------+ +---+ +---+  +---------------+       |        |     |           |   +--------------------+  +---------------+  +--------------+  +------+   |  Network Services  |  |    System     |  |Host Resources|  |MIB-II|   |   Monitoring MIB   |  |Application MIB|--|     MIB      |--|      |   +--------------------+  +---------------+  +--------------+  +------+ </artwork></figure> <t>    The stack of MIBs above &quot;Network Services Monitoring MIB&quot; represent    monitoring from the Service Model.  The other stacks represent    monitoring from the Operational Model.  Neither of these stacks goes    to the level of specific detail for any application. The author is of    the opinion that HTTP or Web Server specific MIBs would exist at the    top of each stack to represent the service and implementation view of    the server respectively.  There should be a relationship between    these two perspectives defined so that the correlations between the    two perspectives is possible.  This relationship would be useful for    general application and service monitoring in addition to just web    servers.  However, it is not of specific interest to either the    MADMAN WG or the Application MIB WG. It is therefore suggested that    such a relationship is defined in a general case outside of either of    those groups that would be applicable for WWW servers as well as for    other application to service mappings. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (6.) --> <section title=\"Definition of additional attributes\"> <t>    The existing MIB attributes meet the Operational Model Requirement    for tracking information specific to a host.  Specifically, MIB-II,    Host Resources and the Applications MIB address these items. The    Network Services MIB addresses a portion of the service model    requirement for the decoupling of the information space from the    transport mechanism. </t> <t>    Several sets of additional attributes are needed to meet the    remaining requirements. These additional attributes may be generally    applicable to other network information retrieval services (like FTP,    NNTP, GOPHER and WAIS) as well as client and proxy management.    Management of these services is not the scope of this document. </t> <t>    These additional attributes can be classified as: <list> <t>    1) Definition of relationship between the Network Services Monitoring       and Application MIBs.  This allows the functional organization of       the server to be known.  It allows the management application to       understand the effect of restarting specific processes on the       services provided.  This addresses the Operational Model       requirement to model dependencies between applications. </t> <t>    2) Additions to generic Network Services Monitoring MIB. A draft <xref target=\"_XREF_9\"/>       has already been circulated due to the work of a mailing list and       a sample implementation.  These attributes list a summary at the       service level of the configuration and the health of the server.       From this, performance metrics can be observed.  In addition, the       health of the server in terms of data timeouts is known.  These       attributes address the requirement for Operational Model tracking       of specific activity and the requirement for Service Model       retrieval services. </t> <t>    3) Document storage and access statistics are needed to address       service model requirements. </t> <t>    4) Additions to Application MIB are required to address server       configuration requirements in the service model. </t> <t>    5) Error and fault management attributes are required to address       requirements for tracking specific activity of the web server. </t> <t>    6) Configuration and Control are items that may be able to be defined       in a general way within the applications MIB.  If not, a specific       definition would be required here. </t></list> </t> <t>    Of the items listed above, (1) is needed on a general basis.  The    others appear to the author as WWW server specific unless the scope    of the work is opened to WWW clients and proxies as well as other    services (like NNTP, FTP, GOPHER and WAIS). </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (7.) --> <section title=\"Usage Scenarios\"> <t>    The example scenario will be a single host computer which implements    WWW services using the &quot;virtual domain&quot; concept.  In this model, a    single host performs as the WWW server for one or more addresses.    For the purpose of example, we will specify that there are three    domains being serviced from this host whose WWW servers are: </t> <figure><artwork>            -www.a.com            -www.b.com            -www.c.com </artwork></figure> <t>    Some implementations may implement these services as one set of    processes that handle requests for each of the addresses.  Others may    implement these services as a set of processes for each address.    This means that the relationship defined between the Network Services    Monitoring MIB and Application MIB components of the management    information may vary between different implementations of the same    configuration. </t> <t>    MIB-II and Host Resources would provide the information about the    host including the CPU, disk and network.  The Host Resource running    table provide information on the processes in the system. </t> <t>    There would be an entry in the Network Services Monitoring applTable    for each virtual domain.  In addition, the assocTable shows which    connections are currently active.  An extension to the association    table would be helpful to provide information as to what is being    transmitted. </t> <t>    The sysApplMib would have entries in its installed software tables    for the web server software and each &quot;interesting&quot; component.  This    should include the server binary, CGI programs, configuration files    and possibly the server log files.  Depending on the implementation    of the server, the processes for each domain may show up in the same    or different running software tables. </t> <t>    Additional information as described in the previous section would    round out the management information that would be available for the    WWW server. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (8.) --> <section title=\"Conclusion\"> <t>    A number of currently defined attributes are useful for management of    a WWW server. Specifically, MIB-II and Host Resources should be    considered for monitoring the health of the machine in terms of host    and network configuration and capacity.  The Network Services    Monitoring MIB and the Application MIBs provide a general framework    to represent the components of the WWW server from both a service and    implementation perspective.  The Network Services Monitoring MIB    suggests that extensions are necessary to cover specific network    application monitoring. A set of such attributes can be well defined    to provide status information of the WWW server.  The Application MIB    suggests similar extensions.  Some of these attributes may be generic    to all applications, and thus be implemented within the scope of the    applMib. It is the opinion of this author that there will still    remain specific instrumentation for WWW servers that can not, and    should not, be covered in the Network Services Monitoring and    Application MIBs. </t> <t>    Since the Network Services Monitoring MIB and the Applications MIB    represent orthogonal efforts of management, it is desirable to define    the relationship between the two in a standard way.  This definition    is probably more than a simple pointer from one table to another.    Since it is outside the scope of either of those efforts, it is this    author&apos;s opinion that that definition could and should be addressed    within the scope of defining management of a specific application (IE    WWW servers). This defintion although defined for a particular    application, should be useful in a general way to describe the    relationship between the Network Services Monitoring MIB and the    Applications MIB. </t> <t>    Additional attributes are needed in order to meet all of the    requirements specified in this document.  An IETF standard would    prevent independent developments of this effort in many enterprise    MIBs.  It also allows management applications to control servers from    multiple vendors.  It is likely that as the work in this area    progresses, the management information will be useful for other    Network Information Retrieval services (like FTP, GOPHER, WAIS and    NNTP) as well. </t> <t>    Finally, the Operational Model and Service Model Requirements lead to    two main uses of the management information.  Design of the MIB    including the usage of the existing MIBs should allow one or the    other or both of these models to be implemented in a standard way.    This may be desirable depending specifically on the audience of the    data, the cost of instrumentation and the resources of the system. </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (9.) --> <section title=\"References (BOILERPLATE)\"> <t> This RFC contained boilerplate in this section which has been moved to the RFC2223-compliant unnumbered section &quot;References.&quot; </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (10.) --> <section title=\"Acknowledgments\"> <t>    This document was produced at the request of the Network Management    Area Director following the HTTP-MIB BOF at the 35th IETF meeting to    report on the applicability of the existing standards track MIBs to    management of WWW servers. </t> <t>    The author gratefully acknowledges the comments of the following    individuals: <list> <t>             Ned Freed, ned@innosoft.com                 Innosoft, Inc. </t> <t>             Harrie Hazewinkel, hazewink@cs.utwente.nl                 University of Twente </t> <t>             Cheryl Krupczak, cheryl@empiretech.com                 Empire Technologies, Inc. </t> <t>             Rui Meneses, rui.meneses@jrc.it                 Centre for Earth Observation </t> <t>             Jon Saperia, saperia@bgs.com                 BGS Systems, Inc. </t> <t>             Juergen Schoenwaelder, schoenw@cs.utwente.nl                 University of Twente </t> <t>             Chris Wellens, chrisw@iwl.com                 InterWorking Labs, Inc. </t></list> </t> </section> <!-- RFC original section: (11.) --> <section title=\"Further Information\"> <t>    The current status of the HTTP-MIB standardization can be found on    the World Wide Web at &lt;URL:http://http-mib.onramp.net/&gt;.
