A carbon&lt;br /&gt; dioxide laser forces a periodically varying heat flux density onto&lt;br /&gt; the water surface and the amplitude damping and phase shift of the&lt;br /&gt; sea surface temperature is measured from infrared image sequences.&lt;br /&gt; The transport process can be treated by linear system theory and the&lt;br /&gt; relation between the input signal (periodically varying surface flux density)&lt;br /&gt; and the output (surface temperature) is estimated. Within the&lt;br /&gt; framework of the SOPRAN initiative three field experiments in the&lt;br /&gt; Baltic Sea were conducted. The locally derived heat transfer rates are&lt;br /&gt; scaled to gas transfer rates, which are in good agreement with empirical&lt;br /&gt; gas transfer wind speed relationships for moderate winds speeds.&lt;br /&gt; At high wind speed, the transfer rates are lower, which is explained&lt;br /&gt; by the fact that heat transport is insensitive to bubble-mediated gas&lt;br /&gt; transfer, i.e. it measures only a part of the transfer process directly at&lt;br /&gt; the water surface.&lt;/p&gt;</ab>   <la/>   <k1>small scale air sea interaction;                 lock-in thermography;                 heat transport at the water surface;                 </k1>   <pb/>   <pp/>   <yr>2011-03-15</yr>   <ed/>   <ul>http://zenodo.org/record/12602/files/DPG2011_ACFT_Poster.pdf;  http://zenodo.org/record/12602/files/DPG2011_ACFT_Poster.png?subformat=icon-90;  </ul>   <no>Imported from Invenio.</no> </reference>   </references>",
