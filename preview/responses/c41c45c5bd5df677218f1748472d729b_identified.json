Any change to presently established protocol  is  going  to  involve  changes  in  the  hardware/software development  efforts  that have, in some instances, been going on for over 6 months.  In the case  of  Multics,  this  effort  has  yielded programs  either  complete or in the advanced debugging stages.  This is no doubt true for many other sites as well.</t></abstract></front>  <seriesInfo name='RFC' value='72' /> <format type='TXT' octets='4047' target='http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc72.txt' /> </reference> ",
