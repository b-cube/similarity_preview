The selection of relevant over irrelevant stimuli is fundamental for efficient interaction with the visual world. Such interaction relies on selection mechanisms that allow for the direction of action to behaviourally relevant items. Attention is influenced by both stimulus-driven (bottom-up) and goal-directed (top-down) processes. According to one view of selective attention, along with the enhancement of selected targeted information, there is a screening-out or gating of unwanted, competing non-target stimuli (e.g., Cohen, Dunbar, &amp; McClelland, 1990; Desimone &amp; Duncan, 1995). An alternative view regarding such non-targets holds that they are not simply screened out, but implicitly regis-tered and subjected to active inhibition (see Tipper, 2001, for a review). The current study looks for evidence of active inhibition in groups of children with potential differences relating to attentional processing. The active inhibition view can be traced to the seminal work of Dalrymple-Alford and Budayr (1966) using Stroop stimuli. Stroop tasks typify a class of interference effects whereby the introduction of task-irrelevant stimulus char-acteristics slows reaction time. In Stroop interference tasks the naming of hues is slowed by the presence of a word that consists of a task-irrelevant colour name that differs from the ink colour of the task-relevant target stimulus. For example, it takes longer to say 'red' to a red-coloured word when the word is incongruent (e.g., green), than if it consists of a neutral stimulus comprising random letters (e.g., iiiii). </summary> <dc:date>2006-12-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Schizophrenia</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27113\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Kevin</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27113</id> <updated>2015-02-24T22:04:41Z</updated> <published>2013-07-23T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Schizophrenia Kevin Nigel James; Rob </summary> <dc:date>2013-07-23T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Drive for leanness and health behaviour within a social/culture framework</title> <link href=\"http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27102\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>David Adrian</name> </author> <author> <name>Christian</name> </author> <author> <name>Gareth A</name> </author> <id>http://hdl.handle.net/2160/27102</id> <updated>2015-02-24T22:02:51Z</updated> <published>2013-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Drive for leanness and health behaviour within a social/culture framework David Adrian; Christian; Gareth A We examined relationships between drive for leanness and perceived media pressure to change appearance, internalization of an ideal physique, exercise frequency, and dieting. Men and women (N = 353) completed the Drive for Leanness Scale, the Sociocultural Attitudes Toward Appearance Questionnaire-3, the Eating Attitudes Test-26, and a demographic inventory. Drive for leanness was significantly correlated with athletic internalization (.52), pressure to attain an ideal physique (.25), exercise frequency (.36), and dieting (.25). Structural equation modeling revealed a good fitting model (\\ufffd\\ufffd2 = 2.85, p &lt; .241; CFI = .99; NNFI = .98; RMSEA = .04; SRMR = .02) with internalization predicting drive for leanness, which in turn predicted dieting and exercise. Results reveal social/cultural theory helps enhance the understanding of the drive for leanness and its relationship with health-related behavior. </summary> <dc:date>2013-01-01T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
