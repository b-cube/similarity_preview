Study&lt;/i&gt; (BES/BGES) series constitutes the longest academic series of nationally representative probability sample surveys in the country. Its broad aim is to explore the changing determinants of electoral behaviour in contemporary Britain. The surveys have taken place immediately after every general election since 1964. Besides the main election surveys, other datasets have also been produced. For example, some studies have included separate sub-samples for ethnic minorities and areas such as Scotland and Northern Ireland (held at the UK Data Archive (UKDA) under SNs 681, 3171, 3889, 3891, and 4622), and several inter-election panel studies have been undertaken between 1969 and 2001 that follow the same individuals interviewed in the cross-sectional surveys (see SNs 422, 2983, 3888, 4000 4028 and 4620).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Since the election series was originated in 1963 by David Butler and Donald Stokes under the name of &lt;i&gt;Political Change in Britain, 1963-1970&lt;/i&gt; (see under GN 33099), it has been under the direction of a number of academics over time, as detailed below.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;British Election Study, 1974-1983&lt;/i&gt; (BES):&lt;br&gt; The BES was started as a research project at the University of Essex in 1974, to continue the series started by Butler and Stokes. The BES conducted interview surveys following the general elections of February 1974, October 1974 and May 1979. This series also includes a questionnaire survey conducted after the referendum on Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1975 (see SN 830).&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;British General Election Study, 1983-1997&lt;/i&gt; (BGES):&lt;br&gt; From 1983, the series continued under a slightly changed name, directed by Anthony Heath, Roger Jowell and John Curtice, and conducted jointly by Social and Community Planning Research (SCPR - now the National Centre for Social Research, or NatCen) and  Nuffield College Oxford. The 1992 BGES surveys were carried out as part of the activities of the Joint Unit for the Study of Social Trends (JUSST), funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). A grant by the ESRC to the University of Strathclyde enabled the representation of Scottish electors in the sample to be boosted substantially. This 'oversampling' of the Scots was undertaken in order to permit more detailed investigation of voting behaviour in Scotland than had usually been the case with the BGES. Prior to 1992 BGES surveys excluded electors living in the five constituencies in the Scottish highlands and islands north of the Caledonian Canal because the small and scattered electorate there could not be interviewed cost-effectively.  In the 1992 BGES survey however, these constituencies were included in the sampling frame. Users should note that the Scottish element of the 1992 survey has been down-weighted to form a representative British sample. Researchers wishing to analyse the Scottish sample separately should order SN 3171 &lt;i&gt;General Election in Scotland, 1992&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; The 1997 studies were carried out by JUSST's successor, the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends (CREST) (an ESRC-funded research centre linking NatCen with the Department of Sociology at the University of Oxford) in collaboration with Pippa Norris of Harvard University, the Gatsby Charitable Foundation and the Commission for Racial Equality. The 1997 BGES included a greater number of separate but interlinked studies than ever before, for example the separate Scottish and ethnic minority boost sample datasets (SNs 3889 and 3891 respectively) mentioned above.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;British Election Study, 2001&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt; The BES for the 2001 general election (the name was changed again), funded by the ESRC, was once again based at the University of Essex, under the control of David Sanders, Paul Whiteley and Harold Clarke. The 2001 survey comprised three main components and two supplementary ones. The first main component comprised a pre- and post-election cross-section survey, and a panel survey (held under SNs 4619 and 4620). The second consisted of a free-standing 4,500-person 'rolling' election campaign survey, conducted during the general election campaign (held under SN 4621), and the third component comprised a separate election survey conducted in Northern Ireland (held under SN 4622). The supplementary components included the construction of an aggregate, 'ecological' data file, based on census and other data, which describes the enumeration district-level, ward-level and constituency-level context for each panel survey respondent, and a content analysis of national press coverage of the election campaign (see SN 4623). This analysis resulted in the creation of a 'campaign dataset' which enabled movements in opinion during the campaign to be related to press coverage of the campaign.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;British Election Study, 2005&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt; The BES for 2005 was also based at the University of Essex. Its principal objectives were to study long-term trends in British voting behaviour; explain the election outcome, party choice and turnout; and examine the consequences of elections for the operation of democracy more generally. The 2005 BES again comprised three main components: the face-to-face cross-section survey and a follow-up conducted one year later (all held under SN 5494), the British component of an international comparative study of electoral systems (SN 5495), and an internet-based pre- and post-election 'rolling' campaign panel survey (SN 5496). Further information about BES 2001 and 2005 may be found on the &lt;a href=\"http://www.essex.ac.uk/bes/\" title=\"British Election Study at the University of Essex\"&gt;British Election Study at the University of Essex&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;British Election Study, 2010&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt; The BES 2010 was also based at the University of Essex. The four major objectives of  the project were to: explain the outcome of the General Election; determine why voters choose one party rather than another; understand why some people vote and others do not; and examine the effects of the election on British politics more generally. The three components of the BES 2010 are held under SNs 7529, 7530 and 7531. Further information may be found on the &lt;a href =\"http://bes2009-10.org/\" title =\"British Election Study 2009-2010\"&gt;British Election Study 2009-2010&lt;/a&gt; web site. The BES &lt;I&gt;Ethnic Minority Survey, 2010&lt;/I&gt; was a distinct survey with a separate sample and fieldwork to that of the main BES 2010.  However, the research was intended to be complementary to the main BES and a large number of items were  shared between the two surveys to enable comparative analysis. The BES &lt;I&gt;Nine-Wave Panel Survey, 2005-2010&lt;/I&gt; (SN 6607) contains panel data from nine surveys conducted from before the 2005 general election to after the 2010 general election. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;BESIS&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;British Election Study&lt;/i&gt; data and documentation from 1966-2010 are also available online via the &lt;a href=\"http://www.besis.org\" title =\"British Election Studies Information System\"&gt;British Election Studies Information System&lt;/a&gt; (BESIS), maintained by the Centre for Comparative European Survey Data (CCESD). Facilities include online analysis, subsetting of data and mapping of election results by constituency.&lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>&lt;i&gt;British Election Study Ethnic Minority Survey, 2010 &lt;/i&gt; is a distinct survey with a separate sample and fieldwork to that of the main BES.  While the main BES survey is a source of robust data at the national level, it cannot provide substantial interview numbers for some subgroups. In particular it has not been possible to conduct a thorough investigation of the political views and behaviours of Britain's ethnic minority populations through the main survey alone. A boost of ethnic minority respondents was carried out as part of the 1997 BES (SN 3891) but nothing since that point. As a result of this the ESRC agreed to fund a survey of ethnic minorities to be conducted immediately after the 2010 general election. The primary focus was on the five main ethnic minority groups - people of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean and Black African background.  However, the research was intended to be complementary to the main BES and a large number of items are shared between the two surveys to enable comparative analysis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Further information may be found on the ESRC &lt;a href=\"http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/RES-062-23-1953-A/read\" title=\"British Election Study Ethnic Minority Survey\"&gt;British Election Study Ethnic Minority Survey&lt;/a&gt; award webpage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <abstract>&lt;B&gt;Main Topics&lt;/B&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The main topics include attitudes towards political issues in the election; ethnic and religious identity and group consciousness; attitudes to integration, integration policies and multiculturalism; voting; war in Afghanistan; traditional dress; discrimination, prejudice and social distance; ethnic social capital and mobilisation.&lt;br&gt; </abstract>       <sumDscr>         <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\">2010</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z\">2010</timePrd>         <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2010-05-01T00:00:00Z\">May 2010</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2010-08-01T00:00:00Z\">August 2010</collDate>         <nation>Great Britain</nation>         <geogUnit>Government Office Regions</geogUnit>         <anlyUnit>Individuals</anlyUnit>         <universe>National</universe>         <universe>Adults aged 18 and over resident in Great Britain who would self-classify into one of five Census ethnic groups: Black Caribbean; Black African; Indian; Pakistani; Bangladeshi</universe>         <dataKind>Numeric data</dataKind>         <dataKind> Individual (micro) level</dataKind>       </sumDscr>     </stdyInfo>     <method>       <dataColl>         <timeMeth>Cross-sectional (one-time) study</timeMeth>         <dataCollector>TNS-BMRB</dataCollector>         <sampProc>Multi-stage stratified random sample</sampProc>         <deviat>2,787</deviat>         <collMode>Face-to-face interview; Self-completion</collMode>         <sources />         <weight>Weighting used.
