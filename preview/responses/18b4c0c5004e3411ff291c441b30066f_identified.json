of Leicester have hit upon unique forms of spinal nerve activity that shape output of nerve cell networks controlling motor behaviours. The research used zebrafish because their motor networks are similar to humans.</p> <p>The breakthrough in the<a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/Biology\" title=\"Biology\" class=\"internal-link\"> Department of Biology</a> is announced today in the journal <em>Current Biology</em>.

They compared infected fish living at 20\\ufffd\\ufffdC to those living at 15\\ufffd\\ufffdC, and found that in warmer water the worms grew four times faster whilst the fish growth slowed. The worms like it warm - but the effect on fish is devastating, reducing their size and interfering with reproduction.</p> <p>Those pesky parasites can also manipulate their hosts. A follow-up study found evidence that fish infected with the worms changed their behaviour and showed a preference for warmer temperatures. This trickery allows the worm to enjoy balmy temperatures and rapid growth - all at the expense of its poor host.</p> <p>The research shows how global warming could potentially affect the balance between parasite and host.

However, vertebrates, including humans, also possess a cluster of dopamine-containing neurons in the forebrain.</p> <p>\"Unlike their midbrain counterparts, these neurons extend projections to the spinal cord, a region that is dedicated to the production of motor behaviours (such as walking and swimming). We know relatively little about the role this forebrain population plays in regulating behaviour: the main aim of our study was to address this problem.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>The Leicester team was able to overcome this problem by examining hatchling zebrafish which are transparent and lack bone tissue, which makes the brain accessible to study. Based on this study, Dr McDearmid said that to date, researchers had not been able to get such clear insights into the inner workings of the brain.</p> <p>The research is important as it helps scientists to better understand the role that dopamine plays in controlling behaviour. In addition, dopaminergic drugs that are used to treat neurological disorders such as Schizophrenia often cause motor side-effects which could be mediated by altered dopamine signalling in the spinal cord. Thus, a better understanding of how dopamine acts in this part of the nervous system may help inform development of new drugs that have fewer motor side effects.</p> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2015/january/novel-study-on-dopamine-neurons-could-instruct-research-into-mobility-and-neurological-disorders\">Press Release </a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ap507</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Research</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-29T17:01:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/august/students-continue-to-rate-the-university-of-leicester-highly\">     <title>Students continue to rate the University of Leicester highly</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/august/students-continue-to-rate-the-university-of-leicester-highly</link>     <description>Results from 2014 National Student Survey announced</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>The results from the 2014 National Student Survey (NSS) have been announced with 89% of University of Leicester students saying that they agreed that \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdOverall, they were satisfied with the quality of the course.\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <p>Biology, Genetics and Spanish all managed perfect 100% student satisfaction scores, whilst the following subject areas all scored 90% or higher: Anatomy, Physiology and Pathology; Archaeology; American, English and French studies; History; Geology; Physical Geography; Physics and Astronomy and Sociology.</p> <p>The results mean that Leicester maintains its historic trend of very high student satisfaction, exceeding the benchmark and remaining firmly in the top twenty English mainstream universities for student satisfaction.</p> <p>More information about the survey can be found via the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/whatwedo/lt/publicinfo/nss/\">NSS website</a>.</p> <ul> <li><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/newsarchive/2014/news87934.html\">HEFCE press release</a></li> </ul>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>er134</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Geology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Genetics</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Archaeology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Sociology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Physics and Astronomy</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Student</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>History</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Biology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Geography</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Physiology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>English</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Magazine:Staff</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>French</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>American Studies</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-08-12T08:20:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Blog Entry</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/october/striking-image-shortlisted-for-competition\">     <title>Striking picture shortlisted for 'Images with Impact' competition</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/news/blog/2014-archive-1/october/striking-image-shortlisted-for-competition</link>     <description>Leicester Biologist's locust wing image included in BBSRC\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds image competition</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Dr Tom Matheson of our <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/biology\">Department of Biology</a> is among those whose images have been shortlisted for the <a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://bbsrc2014.picturk.com/\">BBSRC Images with Impact competition</a></p> <p>As part of his BBSRC-funded research into the neuromechanical control of aimed limb movements, Dr Matheson's team analysed the development and functions of touch-sensitive hairs on the wings of locusts.

By gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for memory acquisition, we aim to improve our ability to enhance the brains capacity to learn and develop strategies for repair following injury or neurodegenerative diseases that affect memory, such as Alzheimer\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease.</p> <p>One of the models of synaptic plasticity that we study is the long-term depression of transmission at the synapse formed between cerebellar granule cells and Purkinje cells. So called LTD may provide the mechanism for learning in the motor system, allowing acquisition of skilled movements during development and practice. Over the last few years, we have examined the contributions of numerous receptors and second messengers to LTD and other forms of plasticity at this synapse, including calcium, nitric oxide, cyclic AMP, cyclic GMP and arachidonic acid.</p> <p>We are currently working towards developing methods of visualising transmitter release and receptor trafficking using fluorescent protein based sensors. Our long term goal is to to be able to visualise synapses \"learning\".&nbsp;We have an interest in developing high speed and high resolution confocal and multiphoton microscopes to allow us to examine the activity of cells within complex neuronal circuits.

Although this was a ground breaking result, it was later showed that the atmospheric conditions used in this experiment did not correspond to the ones of our primitive planet.</p> <p>As the Earth was heavily bombarded by comets, asteroids, meteorites and interplanetary dust particle (IDPs) 4.6 to 3.8 million years ago, the exogenous delivery of organic compounds is an alternative. In fact, carbonaceous meteorites have a rich organic inventory, and may have provided the first building blocks of life to the primitive Earth. As future space missions will investigate the possibility of past and/or present extra-terrestrial life, it is important to determine how life may have originated in other places of our solar system, and how to detect possible bio-signatures.</p> <p>This talk will discuss how the study of meteorites, asteroids, comets and Mars soil analogues is used to investigate the origin of life on Earth and how to detect any possible signatures of extra-terrestrial life in our solar system.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/public-events/research-lectures/zita-martins/research-lecture-zita-martins-flyer\" class=\"internal-link\">Flyer for this event</a></p> <p>\\ufffd\\ufffd</p> <h2 class=\" \">Dr Zita Martins<img style=\"float: right; \" alt=\"Zita Martins_profile\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/assets/ZitaMartins.jpg/@@images/292810ad-3c84-441c-a64c-ab01cecf99ef.jpeg\" title=\"Zita Martins_profile\" class=\"image-inline\" /></h2> <p>Dr Zita Martins is a Royal Society University\\ufffd\\ufffdResearch Fellow at Imperial College London.
