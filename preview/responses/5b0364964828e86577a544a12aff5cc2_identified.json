The intent of this work is five fold: 1) To spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of both reef fishes and macro-invertebrates (conch, lobster, Diadema); 2) To relate this information to in-situ data collected on associated benthic composition parameters; 3) To use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting; 4) To establish the efficacy of those management decisions; and 5) To work with the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program to develop data collection standards and easily implemented methodologies for transference to other agencies and to work toward standardizing data collection throughout the US states and territories.  Toward this end, the Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment's Biogeography Branch (BB) has been conducting research in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands since 2000 and 2001, respectively.  It is critical, with recent changes in management at both locations (e.g. implementation of MPAs) as well as proposed changes (e.g. zoning to manage multiple human uses) that action is taken now to accurately describe and characterize the fish/macro-invertebrate populations in these areas.  It is also important that BB work closely with the individuals responsible for recommending and implementing these management strategies.  Recognizing this, BB has been collaborating with partners at the University of Puerto Rico, National Park Service, US Geological Survey and the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources. To quantify patterns of spatial distribution and make meaningful interpretations, we must first have knowledge of the underlying variables determining species distribution.  The basis for this work therefore, is the nearshore benthic habitats maps (less than 100 ft depth) created by NOAA's Biogeography Program in 2001 and NOS' bathymetry models.  Using ArcView GIS software, the digitized habitat maps are stratified to select sampling stations.  Sites are randomly selected within these strata to ensure coverage of the entire study region and not just a particular reef or seagrass area.   At each site, fish, macro-invertebrates, and benthic composition information is then quantified following standardized protocols.  By relating the data collected in the field back to the habitat maps and bathymetric models, BB is able to model and map species level and community level information.  These protocols are standardized throughout the US Caribbean to enable quantification and comparison of reef fish abundance and distribution trends between locations.  Armed with the knowledge of where \"hot spots\" of species richness and diversity are likely to occur in the seascape, the BB is in a unique position to answer questions about the efficacy of marine zoning strategies (e.g. placement of no fishing, anchoring, or snorkeling locations), and what locations are most suitable for establishing MPAs.  Knowledge of the current status of fish/macro-invertebrate communities coupled with longer term monitoring will enable evaluation of management efficacy, thus it is essential to future management actions.</abstract>    <purpose>1) To spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of both reef fishes and macro-invertebrates (conch, lobster, Diadema); 2) To relate this information to in-situ data collected on water quality and associated habitat parameters; 3) To use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting; 4) To establish the efficacy of those management decisions; and 5) To work with the National Coral Reef Monitoring Program to develop data collection standards and easily implemented methodologies for transference to other agencies and to work toward standardizing data collection throughout the US states and territories.</purpose>    <supplinf>This work is being conducted in collaboration with the National Park Service and the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources.</supplinf>   </descript>   <timeperd>    <timeinfo>     <rngdates>      <begdate>200102</begdate>      <enddate>201010</enddate>     </rngdates>    </timeinfo>    <current>Ground Condition</current>   </timeperd>   <status>    <progress>In work</progress>    <update>twice per year through 2009, once per year 2010-present</update>   </status>   <spdom>    <bounding>     <westbc>-64.67</westbc>     <eastbc>-64.56</eastbc>     <northbc>17.81</northbc>     <southbc>17.75</southbc>    </bounding>   </spdom>   <keywords>    <theme>     <themekt>NOS Data Explorer Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>Environmental Monitoring</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Discovery Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>Numeric Data Sets &gt; Fish Census</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>CoRIS Theme Thesaurus</themekt>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment &gt; Reef fish census &gt; Belt transect</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Mangroves &gt; Monitoring</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Coastal Processes &gt; Mangroves &gt; Animal association</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Zoology &gt; Corals &gt; Reef monitoring and assessment &gt; Reef fish census &gt; Linear transect</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Marine Plants &gt; Seagrass &gt; Monitoring</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Biosphere &gt; Ecological Dynamics &gt; Species richness</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish assemblages</themekey>     <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE &gt; Oceans &gt; Marine Biology &gt; Fish &gt; Fish Census</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>     <themekey>biota</themekey>     <themekey>002</themekey>     <themekey>environment</themekey>     <themekey>007</themekey>     <themekey>oceans</themekey>     <themekey>014</themekey>    </theme>    <theme>     <themekt>None</themekt>     <themekey>coral reef fishes</themekey>    </theme>    <place>     <placekt>CoRIS Place Thesaurus</placekt>     <placekey>COUNTRY/TERRITORY &gt; United States of America &gt; U.

Sites were randomly selected and stratified across by habitat types using NOAA's benthic habitat maps of St. Croix, USVI.</complete>   <lineage>    <procstep>     <procdesc>Once in the field, the boat captain navigates to previously selected sites using a handheld GPS unit. On-site, divers are deployed and maintain contact with each other throughout the entire census. One diver is responsible for collecting data on the fish communities utilizing the belt-transect visual census technique over an area of 100m2 (25m length X 4m width). The belt-transect diver obtains a random compass heading for the transect prior to entering the water and records the compass bearing (0-360o) on the data sheet.  Visibility at each site must be sufficient to allow for identification of fish at a minimum of 2m away. Once reasonable visibility is ascertained, the diver attaches a tape measure to the substrate and allows it to roll out for 25m while they are collecting data. Although the habitat should not be altered in any manner by lifting or moving structure, the observer should record fish seen in holes, under ledges and in the water column. To identify, enumerate, or locate new individuals, divers may move off the centerline of the transect as long as they stay within the 4m transect width and do not look back along area already covered. The diver is allowed to look forward toward the end of the transect for the distance remaining (i.e. if the diver is at meter 15, he can look 10 meters distant, but if he is at meter 23, he can only look 2 meters ahead). On-site, no attempt to avoid structural features within a habitat such as a sand patch or an anchor should be made as these features affect fish communities and are \"real\" component of the habitats. The only two instances where the transect should deviate from the designated path is to stay above 110 ft (limitations imposed by diving) or while surveying mangrove habitats. In mangrove areas, the diver swims close to the prop roots and looks as far into the mangroves as possible; up to 2m and then out to the edge of the mangrove overhang such that the total area surveyed is still 100m2. In this case, some of the survey may necessarily fall on seagrass habitat. This is allowed as the mangrove habitat is defined as a transition zone habitat. The transect should take 15 minutes regardless of habitat type or number of animals present. This allows more mobile animals the opportunity to swim through the transect, and standardizes the samples collected to allow for comparisons. Data are collected on the following: 1) Logistic information - diver name, dive buddy, date, time of survey, site code, transect bearing. 2) Taxa presence - as the tape roles out at a relatively constant speed, the diver records all fish species to the lowest taxonomic level possible that come within 2m of either side of the transect. To decrease the total time spent writing, four letter codes are used that consist of the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name. In the rare case that two species have the same four-letter code, alternate four-letter codes are used to distinguish between the species. These alternate codes contain the first two letters of the genus, the first letter of the species and then the first  letter in the species name that differs from the other code. If the fish can only be identified to the family or genus level then this is all that is recorded. If the fish cannot be identified to the family level then no entry is necessary. 3) Abundance &amp; size - the number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length. If an individual is greater than 35cm, then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded. 4) Photos - individuals too difficult to identify or unique in some manner may be photographed for later clarification. Data Caveats: Overtime, some changes were made to the stratified random site selection process as follows: 1) Habitat strata initially consisted of hard bottom, sand, and seagrass.  Sand and seagrass strata were subsequently combined into one soft bottom strata at all three locations (Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and St. John).  This action was taken after the February 2002 mission to Puerto Rico.  2) A small subset of sites were resampled during each mission through June 2002 in Puerto Rico and October 2002 in St. Croix.  These station names contain the letter 'P' indicating they are permanent stations.  3) The sample area in St. Croix has increased over time.  Initially, samples were collected within historic Buck Island National Monument boundaries as well as outside up to a distance of 0.5 km from those boundaries.  In February 2002 the sampling effort was increased to include the entire expanded monument boundaries.  Finally in April 2003 the effort was increased again to include areas outside of the Monument for control sites.  This area is now almost entirely enclosed within the East End Marine Park of St. Croix.  4) The habitat map utilized to stratify the samples in St. Croix was changed from the original habitat map created with a 1 acre minimum mapping unit to one with a 100m2 minimum mapping unit beginning with the April 2003 mission. 5) The spring St. Croix mission was cancelled in 2007, therefore only one mission was conducted that year. 6) Beginning in 2010, missions to St. Croix was reduced from twice per year (March/April and October) to once per year (October only).
