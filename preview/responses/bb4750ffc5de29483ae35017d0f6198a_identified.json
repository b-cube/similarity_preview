Were they \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmarried\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd in the eyes of English law? Under English law their relationship was deemed a \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdCivil Partnership\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd (Civil Partnership Act 2004, s.215). In this case, Professor Wilkinson petitioned the court to have the parties\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd same sex marriage recognised in England <i>as a marriage</i>. The court was required to consider the compatibility of English law, under the Civil Partnership Act 2004, with Articles 8, 12 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).</p> <p>This case is of interest not just to law students interested in the discrete legal question as to how English law defines foreign relationships and the criteria for their recognition in England, but also to social science students interested in wider issues of how equality and social justice, regardless of gender, can be assured and adequately reflect the construction of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdfamily\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and personal relationships in the twenty-first century. The talk provided an overview of the wider historical context of equality for personal relationships in various countries such as the United States and Canada and the steps towards equality under English law via the Civil Partnership Act 2004 and the Same Sex Marriage Act 2013. The talk also provided a first-hand insight into the Professors\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd experience of what it was like to engage with the litigation process in the English High Court at that time and their own subsequent campaign towards equal marriage rights. On 13 March 2014, Professor Wilkinson and Kitzinger\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds marriage was recognised as a marriage by the introduction of the Marriage Same Sex Couples Act 2013 in England and Wales. The talk concluded with further reflections on how the 2013 Act is another \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdstep\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd towards full equality for all personal relationships.</p> <h3 class=\" \">Details</h3> <p><b>Contact: </b><a class=\"mail-link\" href=\"mailto:lorna.e.gillies@le.ac.uk\">lorna.e.gillies@le.ac.uk</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/law-events/towardsmarriageequality201502.pdf\" class=\"internal-link\">Event poster </a><img alt=\"pdf file\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/images/icons/file-icons/acrobat.gif\" title=\"Adobe Acrobat (PDF)\" class=\"image-inline\" /></p>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ab98</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Conflicts of Law</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Law</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Event</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Civil Justice</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Family Law</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Human Rights</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>News</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-02-23T13:55:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>News Item</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/law-events/postgraduate-fair-for-current-students-2013-wednesday-25-february-2015\">     <title>Postgraduate Fair for Current Students \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Wednesday 25 February 2015</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/law-events/postgraduate-fair-for-current-students-2013-wednesday-25-february-2015</link>     <description>1:00pm\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd3:00pm in the ARC, Students\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd Union.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p>Find out more about studying as a postgraduate at Leicester, including how you may be able to receive a 50% reduction in your course fee.

This convergence between competition and public procurement law is particularly apparent in the 2014 Directives on public procurement, which consolidate the principle of competition in terms very close to those advanced by Dr Sanchez-Graells in the first edition. This second edition deepens the analysis of the market behaviour of the public buyer from a competition perspective and aims to continue influencing developments of EU public procurement law.</p> <p>Dr Sanchez-Graells is a leading expert in EU public procurement and competition law matters. He is currently a member of the European Court of Auditors expert panel on EU institutions procurement. He has invited to speak at over 20 international conferences on the topic and his coming speaking engagements include the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Nottingham, Lisbon, Porto and Barcelona.

The \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdlaw in books\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd is open to interpretation and challenge. Local, national and global developments often require that the law adapt. On occasions the law remains stagnant and the exercise of discretion often results in the law being applied in varying ways. The impact is such that the law can be experienced in many different ways. To understand the full force of the law we must query both the rhetoric and the reality.</p> <p>As \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdresearchers in training\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd we should synthesise, discuss and challenge the law. The Midlands Postgraduate Law Conference aims to provide a forum to share these ideas and perspectives under the theme \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdLaw, Rhetoric and Reality\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.</p> <h2 class=\" \">Details</h2> <p><b>Call for papers</b>: <a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/law-rhetoric-reality/Midlandpostgraduateconferencecallforpapers.pdf\" class=\"internal-link\">Midlands Postgraduate Conference in Law 2015 Call for papers </a>(<img alt=\"pdf file\" src=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/webcentre/plone/images/icons/file-icons/acrobat.gif\" title=\"Adobe Acrobat (PDF)\" class=\"image-inline\" /> PDF) 9 February, 2015 deadline.</p> <p><b>Date:</b> 8-9 May 2015</p> <p><b>Venue: </b>University of Leicester Main Campus (<a href=\"http://collegecourt.co.uk/sites/collegecourt.co.uk/files/college-court-travel-leaflet.pdf\">Maps and directions</a>)</p> <p><b>Contact: </b>For more information please contact <span class=\"mail-link\">Dr. Maribel Canto Lopez</span>, <a class=\"mail-link\" href=\"mailto:micl1@le.ac.uk?subject=Law, Rhetoric and Reality\">micl1@le.ac.uk</a></p> <p><b>Administrative enquiries</b>: Contact Teresa Rowe, <a href=\"mailto:teresa.rowe@le.ac.uk\">teresa.rowe@le.ac.uk</a></p> <h2 class=\" \">Schedule</h2> <table class=\"horizontallinestable\"> <tbody> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\">Friday 8 May </th> </tr> <tr> <td>9.00</td> <td>Registration</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9.30</td> <td><b>Presentations </b><br />(TBA)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.30</td> <td>Lunch<br /></td> </tr> <tr> <td>13.30</td> <td><b>Presentations </b><br />(TBA)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16.30</td> <td>Day one close</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan=\"2\">Saturday 9 May </th> </tr> <tr> <td>9.30</td> <td><b>Presentations </b><br />(TBA)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12.30</td> <td>Lunch</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13.30</td> <td><b>Presentations </b><br />(TBA)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16.30</td> <td>Day two close</td> </tr>  </tbody> </table>]]></content:encoded>     <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>ab98</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Event</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Law</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Postgraduate</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Conference</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2015-01-09T14:50:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>Page</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/university-of-leicester-canadian-law-intervarsity-mooting-competition/university-of-leicester-canadian-law-intervarsity-mooting-competition\">     <title>University of Leicester Canadian Law Intervarsity Mooting Competition</title>     <link>https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/university-of-leicester-canadian-law-intervarsity-mooting-competition/university-of-leicester-canadian-law-intervarsity-mooting-competition</link>     <description>The inaugural competition will begin in early February 2015, taking place over 3 rounds and concluding with a final at Canada House in March 2015.</description>     <content:encoded xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/law/news-events/university-of-leicester-canadian-law-intervarsity-mooting-competition/CanadianLawIntervarsityMootingCompetitionrules.pdf\" class=\"internal-link\">Competition rules (PDF)</a></p> <p>Institutions can enter the competition by emailing the competition convenor, <a href=\"mailto:te41@le.ac.uk\">Dr Tracey Elliott</a> by the 19 January, informing her of your intention to enter the competition and providing staff and student contact details.
