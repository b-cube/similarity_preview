Included   are the adult criminal records of individuals 17 years of age and older   arrested in Michigan from 1974 to 1977. The primary criterion for   inclusion in the sample was at least one arrest in Michigan for murder,   rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, or auto theft. Once   sampled, the arrest history includes data on all recorded arrests   through 1977, regardless of offense type. The full dataset includes   records for 41,191 individuals for a total of 200,007 arrests. The   dataset is organized by individual and includes demographic   characteristics of the individual (birth date, state of birth, sex, and   race) followed by information from the individual's arrest record in   chronological order. The arrest records include the date of arrest, the   offenses charged, the disposition (convicted, dismissed, or acquitted),   and the sentence. Because the data are organized by individual, they   are suitable for longitudinal analyses of individual offending patterns  over time.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1974\" cycle=\"P1\">1974</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1977\" cycle=\"P1\">1977</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Michigan</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                 <universe>Adult criminal offenders in Michigan.</universe>                      <dataKind>event/transaction data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Individuals with at least one arrest in Michigan for  murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, or auto theft.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          criminal history files of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
