The River Kilometer Index (RKI) Stream Trace Files are a set of  arc covers representing centerlines of stream traces for Minnesota rivers.  Digitizing was done by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 1980-81. The base maps for the project were USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle maps where they were available, and 1: 62,500 maps where the 1:24,000's had not been completed.  Digitizing was done in PIOS, the ESRI predecessor to Arc/INFO.  Before beginning this project, DNR obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency digital river trace files of major rivers which had been automated by an EPA contractor in an early attempt to build a  REACH' file.  DNR used these base files, dating from the mid-1970's, then digitized in any tributaries appearing on the 1:24,000 or 1:62,500 base maps which were not on the EPA files. LMIC converted the files from their original PIOS format into ARC/INFO format in 1984. Mile points were generated from the stream trace layers..  Stream traces and mile points are stored in coverages by DNR major watershed (corresponding to USGS 8-digit HUC codes).  A secondary set of files stores only the trace of the major river and its mile points in each major watershed.</abstract> <purpose>The purpose of the RKI Stream Trace and Mile Point data sets was to provide a river mapping and indexing system for the state of Minnesota.</purpose> <supplinf>State of Minnesota</supplinf> </descript> <timeperd> <timeinfo> <sngdate> <caldate>1981</caldate> </sngdate> </timeinfo> <current>Matches content of USGS 1:24,000 and 1:62,500 quad maps available at       the time the project was completed.

Rivers are not all connected (for instance, a river flowing into another river at the point where the receiving river widens into a lake). This has a slight effect on mile point calculations.  Digitization of major river traces is coarse, reflecting the early date of the data preparation (mid-1970's). The digitization of tributary rivers more closely matches the linework on  the base maps.  The mile point calculations are only as good as the original capture of the stream trace lines.</useconst> <ptcontac> <cntinfo> <cntperp> <cntper>Susanne Maeder</cntper> <cntorg>Minnesota Land Management Information Center (LMIC)</cntorg> </cntperp> <cntpos>GIS Data Coordinator</cntpos> <cntaddr> <addrtype> Mailing and Physical</addrtype> <address>300 Centennial Building; 658 Cedar Street</address> <city>St. Paul</city> <state>Minnesota</state> <postal>55155</postal> </cntaddr> <cntvoice>651.201.2488</cntvoice> <cntfax>651.296.3698</cntfax> <cntemail>clearing.house@state.mn.us</cntemail> </cntinfo> </ptcontac> <browse> <browsen>ftp://ftp.lmic.state.mn.us/pub/data/phys_biol/water/rkip.gif</browsen> <browsed>Arc 7.1.1</browsed> </browse> <native>Arc 7.1.1</native> <crossref> <citeinfo> <title>REFERENCES: Stream Inventory and Data Retrieval System Program, DNR Office of Planning, 1981.  1.SIDRS Report 7001.

DNR obtained from USEPA a set of river trace files for major rivers. These files had  been created in the mid-1970s.  Further processing of these files was done                     on a major watershed basis.  The GIS system used was the Polygon Information  Overlay System (PIOS), the ESRI predecessor to Arc/INFO. DNR staff digitized the remaining river traces on each 1:24,000 or 1:62,500 map sheet, and appended the information onto the EPA data.  River kilometer points,  and, later,  mile points, were calculated by the system.  (1984) PIOS/ARC Conversion.  LMIC converted the files from PIOS to ARC/INFO.  River mile points were calculated for each river trace and written to a separate point file.  Because the river traces were not all connected, this was done by a specially-written program not part of the Arc/INFO tool set.  Files at this time were UTM, Zone 15, NAD27, single precision, with a Y-shift of -4,700,000.  (1997) Conversion to NAD83.  LMIC converted all coverages to UTM, Zone 15 Extended, NAD83, double precision, unshifted.</procdesc> </procstep> </lineage> </dataqual> <spdoinfo> <indspref></indspref> <direct>Point</direct> <mgmg3obj>Point</mgmg3obj> <mgmg3til>Data stored in DNR major watershed files; Major river points are stored in major river files for each major watershed</mgmg3til> </spdoinfo> <spref> <horizsys> <geograph> <latres></latres> <longres></longres> </geograph> <planar> <mapproj> <mapprojn></mapprojn> <mgmg4par></mgmg4par> <otherprj></otherprj> </mapproj> <gridsys> <gridsysn>UTM</gridsysn> <utm> <utmzone>15E</utmzone> </utm> <spcs> <spcszone></spcszone> </spcs> <mgmg4coz></mgmg4coz> <mgmg4adj></mgmg4adj> </gridsys> <planci> <coordrep> <absres></absres> <ordres></ordres> </coordrep> <distbrep> <distres></distres> </distbrep> <plandu>Meters</plandu> </planci> </planar> <geodetic> <horizdn>NAD83</horizdn> <ellips>GRS 1980</ellips> </geodetic> </horizsys> <vertdef> <altsys> <altdatum></altdatum> <altunits></altunits> </altsys> <depthsys> <depthdn></depthdn> <depthdu></depthdu> </depthsys> </vertdef> </spref> <eainfo> <overview> <eaover>Rivers covers  represent ALL  rivers in a major watershed.  They are named RIVERXX, where XX' is the DNR major watershed number.  Major rivers covers represent ONLY the major river flowing through each major watershed (e.g., for DNR major watershed #29, the Cottonwood River            Basin, the major rivers file would represent only the Cottonwood trace.)  Major rivers Coverages are named  MRIVXX', where  XX' is the DNR major watershed number.  Mile points associated with the full stream trace covers (RIVERXX) are stored as RMILEXX, where XX' is the DNR major watershed number.  Mile points associated with the major river within each major watershed (MRIVXX) are stored in MRMILEXX,  where  XX' is the DNR major watershed.  Major rivers which flow through more than one major watershed are named for the major watershed in which they originate.  For example, the Mississippi is MRIV07, the Minnesota is MRIV22, the St. Croix is MRIV34, the Red is MRIV54, and the Rainy is MRIV72.   River traces for these five large rivers in Minnesota have been pulled out into separate coverages and are NOT in the corresponding RIVERXX covers. Because the state's large rivers flow through many major watersheds and are only stored once (with the major watershed of origin), there is not an  MRIV' coverage for every DNR major watershed.  River Mile Point files are organized accordingly.  DNR major watershed names and numbers are as follows: 1 BAPTISM-BRULE ***  2 BEAVER-LESTER ***  3 ST.
