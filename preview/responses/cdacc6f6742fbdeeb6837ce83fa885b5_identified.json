The study probed the public's familiarity with the existing constitution as well as opinions regarding a possible revision of this document. A series of questions explored respondents' knowledge of the content of the constitution, the changes brought through its postwar revision, and the influence of the United States in rewriting it. Specific questions dealt with the role of the emperor, Japanese self-defense forces, and Japan's position in a world dominated by the United States and Russia. Respondents were further queried about a variety of specific revisions that might be made to the constitution: limitations on the right to strike, reversal of the stand on equality of the sexes, and changes in the bicameral system of the Diet (Japan's legislative assembly). The respondents' exposure to the mass media was also briefly explored. Demographic data include sex, age group, marital status, education, and occupation.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1963\" cycle=\"P1\">1963</timePrd>                                                            <collDate event=\"single\" date=\"1963-08\" cycle=\"P1\">1963-08</collDate>                             <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>             <geogCover>Japan</geogCover>                                 <universe>Population of Japan aged 20 years and older.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>      <sources>          <dataSrc>                          personal interviews             </dataSrc>        </sources>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure.
