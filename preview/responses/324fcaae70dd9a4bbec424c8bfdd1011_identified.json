Observations were periodically checked during the expedition for consistency between divers, and little discrepancy was ever noted between divers. It should be noted, however, that this data set is quite large, and probably includes typographical or other errors that might be discovered at a future date.       </attraccr>   </attracc>   <logic>       The same methods of data collection were used at each of the sites surveyed at this location, and were conducted by the same scientists. Periodic examination of the data through the duration of the trip showed no signs of diver bias or other discrepancies.     </logic>   <complete>       The survey sites were selected to be representative of the coral reef habitats at this reef system. Efforts were made to include broad spatial coverage of the reef area, but weather conditions or other environmental constraints may have precluded the team from surveying windward or exposed sites.     </complete>   <posacc>    <horizpa>     <horizpar>           GPS unit         </horizpar>     <qhorizpa>      <horizpav>             1           </horizpav>      <horizpae>             Instrument parameters           </horizpae>     </qhorizpa>    </horizpa>    <vertacc>     <vertaccr>           Dive computer and SCUBA depth gauge         </vertaccr>     <qvertpa>      <vertaccv>             0.3           </vertaccv>      <vertacce>             Instrument parameters           </vertacce>     </qvertpa>    </vertacc>   </posacc>   <lineage>    <procstep>     <procdesc>           Data were collected by two divers swimming in tandem along the length of a 25m transect line. The team swam each transect two times. During the initial swim-out, each diver recorded the abundance and size of all fish observed over 20cm TL within 4m of their side of the transect line. On the return swim, each diver recorded the abundance and size of all fish less than 20cm TL within 2m of their side of the transect line. Fish were identified to the lowest possible taxon which in most cases was the species level. This data is recorded in the spreadsheet as DataTyp = QUAN. Following the completion of three transect replicates at each site, the divers spent their remaining bottom time roving the general area near the site recording the presence of all fish species observed at the site. This data is recorded in the spreadsheet as DataTyp = PRES. Upon returning to the ship and Honolulu offices, data were error checked, and data from the three fish surveyors were consolidated into one spreadsheet. Data have not been modified, and this data set includes raw data.         </procdesc>     <procdate>           Unknown         </procdate>    </procstep>   </lineage>  </dataqual>  <spref>   <horizsys>    <geograph>     <latres>           0.0001         </latres>     <longres>           0.0001         </longres>     <geogunit>           Decimal Degrees         </geogunit>    </geograph>    <geodetic>     <horizdn>           World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84)         </horizdn>     <ellips>           Geodetic Reference System 80 (GRS80)         </ellips>     <semiaxis>           6378137         </semiaxis>     <denflat>           298.2572236         </denflat>    </geodetic>   </horizsys>   <vertdef>    <depthsys>     <depthdn>           Local surface         </depthdn>     <depthres>           1         </depthres>     <depthdu>           meters         </depthdu>     <depthem>           Explicit Depth Coordinate Included with Horizontal Coordinates         </depthem>    </depthsys>   </vertdef>  </spref>  <distinfo>   <distrib>    <cntinfo>     <cntorgp>      <cntorg>             Coral Reef Ecosystem Division (CRED), Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center (PIFSC), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)           </cntorg>      <cntper>             CRED Data Management Team           </cntper>     </cntorgp>     <cntaddr>      <addrtype>             mailing and physical address           </addrtype>      <address>NOAA IRC</address>      <address>NMFS/PIFSC/CRED</address>      <address>1845 WASP Blvd., Building 176</address>      <city>             Honolulu           </city>      <state>             HI           </state>      <postal>96818</postal>      <country>             USA           </country>     </cntaddr>     <cntvoice>808 725-5360</cntvoice>     <cntfax>808 725-5429</cntfax>     <cntemail>           nmfs.pic.credinfo@noaa.gov         </cntemail>     <cntinst>           e-mail preferred         </cntinst>    </cntinfo>   </distrib>   <resdesc>       Offline Data     </resdesc>   <distliab>       While every effort has been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the limits of the current state of the art, NOAA cannot assume liability for any damages caused by errors or omissions in the data, nor as a result of the failure of the data to function on a particular system.
