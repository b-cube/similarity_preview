National level vegetation surveys were conducted in May 1986, October 1986 and Spring 1987. More intensive surveys of vegetation (grass and heather) and wildlife (grouse, fox, etc.) in restricted areas were carried out in Cumbria, Wales and North Yorkshire in 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1993. Surveys of fungi were carried out between 1994 and 1997. The data are suitable for interpolation to create spatially variable surfaces suitable for input into models.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Claire Wood</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Chernobyl</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deposition</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>accident</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radiocaesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>North Wales</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Yorkshire</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>GB</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>fungi</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>wildlife</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grasses</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>heather</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Pollution &amp; Environmental Risk</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2014-09-25T09:02:58Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e40b53d4-6699-4557-bd55-10d196ece9ea\">     <title>Element and radionuclide concentrations in representative species of the ICRP's Reference Animals and Plants and associated soils from a forest in north-west England</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/e40b53d4-6699-4557-bd55-10d196ece9ea</link>     <description>This dataset presents the results of an initial sampling exercise conducted at a terrestrial site in northwest England in summer 2010. The following samples of terrestrial Reference Animals and Plants (RAPs) were obtained from an area of circa 0.4 km squared:  Molinia caerulea (ICRP RAP Wild Grass defined as Poaceae); Picea sitchensis (ICRP RAP Pine Tree defined as Pinaceae); Apis spp., Bombus spp., Nomada spp. (ICRP RAP Bee defined as Apidea); Apodemus sylvaticus (ICRP RAP Rat defined as Muridae); Earthworms (species in the Family Lumbricidae as defined for the ICRP RAP Earthworm); Deer (belonging to the Family Anatidae (i.e. the ICRP RAP Deer).  Soil samples were also collected from throughout the sampling area. All samples were analysed for multiple elements using ICP-MS/ICP-OES and most for gamma-emitting radionuclides. Results have been used to derive biota-soil concentration ratios.   The ICRP have published their framework for radiation protection of the environment (ICRP Publication 108). This describes the use of RAPs as the basis for their framework. The RAPs are generalised to the taxonomic level of Family. Publication 108 presented dose coefficient values for the selected RAPs and also reviewed data on the effects of ionising radiation to suggest Derived Consideration Reference Levels for each RAP.  In summer 2010 the ICRP released a further report on their protection framework for consultation. This report presented transfer parameter values (organism-media concentration ratios) for Reference Animals and Plants. The report also raised the possibility of identifying a series of sites where samples of each Reference Animal and Plant, and their different lifestages, could be collected and analysed. It was suggested that the resultant data would constitute a set of reference values analogous to approaches used by the ICRP for human radiological protection.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Jacky Chaplow</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Cumbria</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>UK</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>ICRP RAP</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>natural radioactivity</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>chemical analysis</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Soil</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>grass</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>pine tree</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>earthworm</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>bee</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>deer</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>mice</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2013-02-20T13:50:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/2641515f-5b76-445c-a936-1da51bf365ad\">     <title>Exposure of burrowing mammals to Radon Rn-222 in Northwest England</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/2641515f-5b76-445c-a936-1da51bf365ad</link>     <description>This dataset includes individual passive detector measurements of radon Rn-222 in the air of artificial burrows, Rn-222 measurements by instrumentation in soil gas of interstitial soil pores and burrow air, gamma analyses results for soil samples and, soil moisture and temperature data.   Estimates of absorbed dose rates to wildlife from exposure to natural background radionuclides are required to put estimates of dose rates arising from regulated releases of radioactivity and proposed benchmarks into context. These data are from a study conducted at seven sites in northwest England (comprising broadleaved and coniferous woodlands, scrubland and pastures). Passive track etch detectors were used to measure the Rn-222 concentrations in artificial burrows over a period of approximately one year (July 2009 to June 2010). Instrumented measurements of burrow air and soil pore gas were also conducted in October 2009.     The data result from a study funded by NERC-CEH and the England &amp; Wales Environment Agency.

Iodine-131 was measurable in grass samples across the country with activity concentrations ranging from 10 to 55 Bq per kg dry matter. Concentrations were similar to those reported in other European countries.  Rainwater and some foodstuffs were also analysed from a limited number of sites. Of these, I-131 was only detectable in sheep's milk (c. 2 Bq/kg). Caesium-134, which can be attributed to releases from the Fukushima reactors, was detectable in six of the grass samples (4-8 Bq/kg dry matter); 137Cs was detected in a larger number of grass samples although previous release sources (atmospheric weapons test and the 1986 Chernobyl and 1957 Windscale accidents) are likely to have contributed to this.  All data and information for this sampling are available from this record. The data result from collaboration between CEH and the University of Stirling.</description>          <dc:publisher>No publisher</dc:publisher>     <dc:creator>Dan Wright</dc:creator>     <dc:rights></dc:rights>            <dc:subject>Environmental monitoring facilities</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>March-May 2011</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Fukushima</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Japan</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>Great Britain</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioecology</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>NERC_DDC</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Project NEC04023</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>vegetation</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>foodstuffs</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>CEH Biogeochemistry Programme</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>STAR_NOE</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>I-131</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>caesium</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radioactive contamination</dc:subject>                 <dc:subject>radionuclide</dc:subject>          <dc:date>2012-01-04T15:45:00Z</dc:date>     <dc:type>EIDC Document Container</dc:type>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ed90df1b-462c-46bb-afbd-59794fb03f6b\">     <title>Elemental concentrations in fish from lakes in Northwest England</title>     <link>http://eidchub.ceh.ac.uk/metadata/ed90df1b-462c-46bb-afbd-59794fb03f6b</link>     <description>Data comprise concentrations of elements in ashed fish sampled from lakes in the English Lake District in 2012 and 2013.
