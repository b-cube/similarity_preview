The database was constructed by merging variables derived from these  existing datasets: (1) POLITY III: REGIME TYPE AND POLITICAL AUTHORITY  1800-1994 (Jagger and Gurr 1995) [ICPSR 6695], (2) CROSS-NATIONAL TIME  SERIES, 1815-1973 (Banks 1993) [ICPSR 7412], (3) Polity IV (Jagger and  Gurr 2005), (4) Political Freedom Indicators (Freedom House 2000), (5)  World Development Indicators 1960-1998 (World Bank 1999), and (6)  World Development Indicators 1960-2005 (World Bank 2006). In addition,  missing variables were coded from the Statesman's Yearbook (2000), the  World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators (Taylor and Jodice  1983), Encyclopedia of the United Nations and International Relations  (Osmanczyk 1982), and the journal, \"Freedom Review,\" published by  Freedom House. A sovereign country was defined as an independent  member of the international system, which had a population greater  than 500,000. In the database, for each sovereign country there are  over 120 indicators, annually recorded, that represent: (1) the level  of democratic growth, (2) the countries' development depicted by  socioeconomic, demographic, and geographical characteristics, and (3)  diffusion indicators. In addition, to add precision to the  measurement, modifications of the core indicators were also recorded. The database is complimented by an index of variables.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1800\" cycle=\"P1\">1800</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2005\" cycle=\"P1\">2005</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1998-09\" cycle=\"P1\">1998-09</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2007-06\" cycle=\"P1\">2007-06</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>                                 <universe>The 187 sovereign countries (20 historical and 167  contemporary) that were independent members of the international  system and had populations greater than 500,000 from the years 1800 to 2005.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    All sovereign, historical, and contemporary countries in the world with populations greater than 500,000.          </sampProc>                      <weight>                    </weight>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 (1) Blank value labels are considered missing.  Exceptions involve the variables XRREG, XRCOMP, XCONST, PARREG,  PARCOMP, AUTONOMY, FREPRESS, FRDEMNST, EQUALAW, FRCORRUP, and  FRPERSON. These were weighted to compare the Freedom House and Jagger  and Gurr's scales. These variables were reformated to match the data.  (2) The following values are unknown: 0 in PREMIER, 0 in MONO, and  .. in IT_TVS_C. (3) The data contain too many values to test the Stata  setup file. Variables with several thousand values may need to have the values recoded into groups for testing.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR20440.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
