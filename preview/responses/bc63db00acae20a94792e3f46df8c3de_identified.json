We report the covalent post-assembly modification of kinetically metastable amine-bearing FeII2L3 triple helicates via acylation and azidation. Covalent modification of the metastable helicates prevented their reorganization to the thermodynamically favored FeII4L4 tetrahedral cages, thus trapping the system at the non-equilibrium helicate structure. This functionalization strategy also conveniently provides access to a higher-order tris(porphyrinatoruthenium)\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhelicate complex that would be difficult to prepare by de novo ligand synthesis.

These compounds are of special interest as transition-state mimics for the enzyme-catalyzed cis\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdtrans rotamer interconversion of amides involved in peptide and protein folding and function. The stabilization of the amide group in its high energy, perpendicular conformation common to both systems is shown for the rigid tricyclic system to depend, as predicted by calculation, on its methyl group substitution pattern, making 3 by some way the most reactive known \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdamide\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd.

S.; Grayson, Matthew N.; Goodman, Jonathan M.; Cook, Matthew J. Two base mediated cascade rearrangement reactions of diallyl ethers were developed&#13; leading to selective [2,3]-Wittig-oxy-Cope and isomerization-Claisen rearrangements. Both diaryl and&#13; aryl-silyl substituted 1,3-substituted propenyl substrates were examined and each exhibits unique&#13; reactivity and different reaction pathways. Detailed mechanistic and computational analysis was&#13; conducted which demonstrated that the role of the base and solvent were key to the reactivity and&#13; selectivity observed. Crossover experiments also suggest that these reactions proceed with a certain&#13; degree of dissociation and the mechanistic pathway is highly complex with multiple competing routes.

Over the last decade molecular containers have been increasingly studied within the context of&#13; complex chemical systems. Herein we discuss selected examples from the literature concerning&#13; three aspects of this field: complex host\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdguest behaviour, adaptive transformations of molecular&#13; containers and reactivity modulation within them.
