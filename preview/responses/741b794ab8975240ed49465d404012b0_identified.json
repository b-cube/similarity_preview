Foust. The data file and accompanying documentation are provided to assist educators in (an SPSS portable file) instructing students about the history of agriculture and rural life in the North, just prior to the Civil War. An instructor's handout has also been included. This handout contains the following sections, among others: (1) General goals for student analysis of quantitative datasets, (2) Specific goals in studying this dataset, (3) Suggested appropriate courses for use of the dataset, (4) Tips for using the dataset, and (5) Related secondary source readings. Demographic, occupational, and economic information for over 21,000 rural households in the northern United States in 1860 are presented in the dataset. The data were obtained from the manuscript agricultural and population schedules of the 1860 United States Census and are provided for all households in a single township from each of the 102 randomly-selected counties in 16 northern states. Variables in the dataset include farm values, livestock, and crop production figures for the households that owned or operated farms (over half the households sampled), as well as value of real and personal estate, color, sex, age, literacy, school attendance, occupation, place of birth, and parents' nationality of all individuals residing in the sampled townships.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1860\" cycle=\"P1\">1860</timePrd>                                                        <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"1989\" cycle=\"P1\">1989</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2002\" cycle=\"P1\">2002</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Connecticut</geogCover>             <geogCover>Illinois</geogCover>             <geogCover>Indiana</geogCover>             <geogCover>Iowa</geogCover>             <geogCover>Kansas</geogCover>             <geogCover>Maryland</geogCover>             <geogCover>Michigan</geogCover>             <geogCover>Minnesota</geogCover>             <geogCover>Missouri</geogCover>             <geogCover>New Hampshire</geogCover>             <geogCover>New Jersey</geogCover>             <geogCover>New York (state)</geogCover>             <geogCover>Ohio</geogCover>             <geogCover>Pennsylvania</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>             <geogCover>Vermont</geogCover>             <geogCover>Wisconsin</geogCover>                                 <universe>956 counties in 20 northern states.</universe>                      <dataKind>census/enumeration data</dataKind>               <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The data (AGRICULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR RURAL    HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NORTH, 1860 [ICPSR 7420]) were collected using a    two-stage variable-cluster sample design. A random sample of 102    counties in 16 northern states was drawn. From each of these counties    one non-urban township was randomly selected. Census records from all   households in the selected townships were included in the study.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          manuscript schedules of the 1860 United States Census             </dataSrc>        </sources>                 </dataColl>       <notes>                 This collection was archived by ICPSR to promote the use of social science data in undergraduate and graduate education through the sharing of faculty-submitted ICPSR data-based instructional materials developed for use in the classroom.         </notes>                  <notes>                                          <p>These materials were designed for use with <ExtLink URI=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR07420\"> AGRICULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC RECORDS FOR RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NORTH, 1860 (ICPSR 7420)</ExtLink>.</p>                               </notes>                  <notes>                 The data are provided as an SPSS portable file, which was created from the ASCII data and SPSS data definition statements files available from ICPSR 7420.         </notes>                          <anlyInfo>             </anlyInfo>        </method>        <dataAccs>            <setAvail media=\"online\">                      <accsPlac URI=\"http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR03463.v1\">Ann Arbor, Mi.: Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research</accsPlac>                 </setAvail>            <useStmt>                 <specPerm>Additional special permissions, where applicable, are described in the restrictions                 field.</specPerm>                                   <restrctn>                                    At the request of the principal investigator,    publications that draw upon the data, AGRICULTURAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC    RECORDS FOR RURAL HOUSEHOLDS IN THE NORTH, 1860 (ICPSR 7420), must   observe the copyright held by Professors Bateman and Foust.             </restrctn>                   <conditions>         <p>Please read the terms of use below.
