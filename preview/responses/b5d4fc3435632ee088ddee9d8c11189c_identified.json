The U.S. Geological Survey developed the GNIS for the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, a Federal inter-agency body chartered by public law to maintain uniform feature name usage throughout the Government and to promulgate standard names to the public. The GNIS is the official repository of domestic geographic names data; the official vehicle for geographic names use by all departments of the Federal Government; and the source for applying geographic names to Federal electronic and printed products of all types. See http://geonames.usgs.gov for additional information.</abstract><purpose>The Geographic Names Information System contains information about physical and cultural geographic features of all types in the United States, associated areas, and Antarctica, current and historical, but not including roads and highways. The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state, county, USGS topographic map, and geographic coordinates. Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name, feature designations, feature classification, historical and descriptive information, and for some categories the geometric boundaries. The database assigns a unique, permanent feature identifier, the Feature ID, as a standard Federal key for accessing, integrating, or reconciling feature data from multiple data sets. The GNIS collects data from a broad program of partnerships with Federal, State, and local government agencies and other authorized contributors. The GNIS provides data to all levels of government and to the public, as well as to numerous applications through a web query site, web map and feature services, file download services, and customized files upon request.</purpose><supplinf>The U.S. Board on Geographic Names was created in 1890 and established in its present form by Public Law in 1947 to establish and maintain uniform geographic name usage throughout the Federal Government. The Board serves all government agencies and the public as the central authority to which name inquiries, name issues, and new name proposals can be directed. It is comprised of representatives of Federal agencies associated with land management and cartography. Sharing its responsibilities with the Secretary of the Interior, the Board develops principles, policies, and procedures governing the use of both domestic and foreign geographic names as well as undersea and Antarctic feature names.</supplinf></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><rngdates><begdate>1974</begdate><enddate>Present</enddate></rngdates></timeinfo><current>Ground Condition</current></timeperd><status><progress>In work</progress><update>As needed</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc>-180.00</westbc><eastbc>180.00</eastbc><northbc>72.00</northbc><southbc>-90.00</southbc></bounding></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>None</themekt><themekey>location</themekey><themekey>economy</themekey><themekey>society</themekey><themekey>environment</themekey><themekey>structure</themekey><themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey><themekey>inlandWaters</themekey><themekey>transportation</themekey><themekey>utilitiesCommunication</themekey><themekey>Feature identification</themekey><themekey>Geographic feature</themekey><themekey>Geographical feature</themekey><themekey>Geographic name</themekey><themekey>Geographical name</themekey><themekey>Feature name</themekey><themekey>Official feature name</themekey><themekey>Place name</themekey><themekey>Variant name</themekey><themekey>Feature coordinates</themekey><themekey>Feature state</themekey><themekey>Feature county</themekey><themekey>Feature class</themekey><themekey>Feature history</themekey><themekey>Feature description</themekey><themekey>Feature designation</themekey></theme><place><placekt>Geographic Names Information System, USGS, Reston, VA</placekt><placekey>United States</placekey><placekey>State</placekey><placekey>County</placekey><placekey>Territory</placekey><placekey>Outlying Area</placekey><placekey>Topographic Map</placekey><placekey>Commonwealth</placekey><placekey>Parish</placekey><placekey>Borough</placekey><placekey>Census Area</placekey><placekey>Municipio</placekey><placekey>District</placekey><placekey>Populated Place</placekey><placekey>Antarctica</placekey></place><temporal><tempkt>None</tempkt><tempkey>Current</tempkey><tempkey>Historical</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>None</accconst><useconst>None.

Subsequent to the original data compilation process, which was taken primarily from Federal maps, the GNIS has become dependent on input from Federal, State, county, and local government agencies and other approved sources. The completeness, currency, and accuracy of the data varies by area depending on the quality and timeliness of that input. Accordingly, the Geographic Names Project actively seeks to expand partnerships with Government agencies at all levels and other interested organizations. The latest tools and methodologies are being applied, including web map and feature services, and joint or linked web applications, to ensure that local data are properly represented in the GNIS and through the GNIS to all Federal agencies and to the public. Feature additions or corrections are accepted for consideration from any source, and when validated by appropriate agencies, will be entered into the database. Local and State agencies are encouraged to submit data and to participate in the GNIS partnership program. Non-government organizations with valuable data are considered on a case basis. Authorized partners have access to web based transaction entry and edit forms, which submit data directly to the GNIS for review and inclusion in the database. Partners also submit batch files in most standard formats, and coordinate with the Geographic Names Project to develop joint services, processes, and applications for greatest efficiency. Data entered into the GNIS immediately is available to all web services and applications dependent on it.

The number, by design, carries no information or association to the content of the feature record and therefore is not subject to change as attribute values change. Once assigned to a feature, the number is never changed or withdrawn, and never reassigned. The Feature ID can be applied in conjunction with system-unique record identifiers in any database or system, thus providing a national standard common reference identifier across multiple datasets.

The location is determined by the authoritative source and is approved or recognized as official by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names by decision or by policy delegation to the authoritative source. The placing of the location point is governed by policies of the Board as defined in the Names Data Users Guide and GNIS metadata, generally at or near the geographic center, but there are exceptions for certain classes of features. For example, the official feature location of flowing bodies of water (streams, rivers, creeks, etc.) or trending linear features (valleys, gulchs, gullys, hollows, etc.) is at the mouth. A geographic feature may have only one official location regardless of size, extent, composition, structure, or boundaries. The location point is coincident with, but in addition to and independent of, any other geospatial representation or boundary definition that may be attached to the feature in other datasets. Linear and aerial features may have secondary points as defined in the Names Data Users Guide and GNIS metadata. Locations are stored in the Geographic Names Information System as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees to seven places, North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), and are available in geospatial format as needed. (Note: Records showing all zeros for latitude and longitude indicate that the coordinates of the feature are unknown. They are recorded in the database as zeros to satisfy the format requirements of a numerical data type.

With one exception (i.e., the point representing the source of a stream, valley or arroyo may be on the same map as the primary point) a feature is assigned one point per map on which it is located. The points are sequenced. Sequence number one is always the primary point and the remaining points are secondary points. For a linear feature with feature class equal to valley, stream, or arroyo, the points are sequenced from mouth toward the source and the highest sequence number is the source. For other linear features and for areal features, secondary points are sequenced according to guidelines of the U.S. Board On Geographic Names. The location of the point on the feature within the map is arbitrary. This method of associating features with maps was conceived prior to geographic information system technology and has been retained as a useful approximation of feature extent and a reference to printed maps. These points do not represent boundaries or geometries and should not be confused with them. Secondary points are stored in the Geographic Names Information System as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees to seven places, North American Datum 1983 (NAD83), and are available in geospatial format as needed.

Other examples include State Capitol, County Seat, Independent City, and Subdivision. A feature may have more than one designation.

Elevation figures are not official and do not represent precisely measured or surveyed values. The data are extracted from the National Elevation Dataset (http://ned.usgs.gov/) for the primary coordinates and may differ from elevations cited in other sources. The differences will be most evident for features such as summits where precision is of more concern and where the local relief (rate of change of elevation) may be more prominent. However, the elevation figures are within tolerances for the data for most points and sufficiently accurate for purposes of general information.</attrdef><attrdefs>Geographic Names Project, USGS, 523 National Center, Reston, VA 20192-0523.</attrdefs><attrdomv><rdom><rdommin>-4,115</rdommin><rdommax>6,250</rdommax><attrunit>Meters</attrunit></rdom></attrdomv></attr><attr><attrlabl>USGS Map Name</attrlabl><attrdef>The name of the standard USGS 7.5x7.5 minute quadrangle map(s) containing the representation of the feature.</attrdef><attrdefs>Geographic Names Project, USGS, 523 National Center, Reston, VA 20192-0523.</attrdefs><attrdomv><codesetd><codesetn>The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS)</codesetn><codesets>The official database of names assigned to standard USGS products according to USGS policy and procedures, including standard 7.5x7.5 minute quadrangle maps and digital products.
