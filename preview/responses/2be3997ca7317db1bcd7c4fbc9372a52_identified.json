THE BRAKE WAS NOT HOLDING AND I STARTED MOVING CLOSER TO THE CAR STOPPED FOR THE RED LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I THEN PUT THE TRANSMISSION IN NEUTRAL WHILE THE ENGINE WAS STILL AT 5,000 RPM AND GETTING FASTER. FINALLY, THE ENGINE CAME DOWN TO ABOUT 1,000 RPM AND I CONTINUED THROUGH THE INTERSECTION ON THE GREEN LIGHT AFTER PLACING THE CAR IN DRIVE. I DROVE TO WORK AND CALLED THE ACURA DEALER THAT I PURCHASED THIS \"CERTIFIED USED CAR\" FROM AND THEY CAME TO MY WORK AND HAULED THE ACURA RDX TO THE DEALER LOCATION. THEY INFORMED ME THAT A \"SPECIAL ACURA INVESTIGATING TEAM\" WILL COME AND LOOK AT THE CAR ON TUESDAY, APRIL 1, 2014.  THIS IS MY WIFE'S CAR I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF SHE WAS DRIVING. THIS INSTANT ACCELERATION, WITHOUT PLACING THE CAR IN NEUTRAL, WOULD HAVE PUSHED THE CAR IN FRONT OF ME AND MYSELF DIRECTLY INTO A BUSY INTERSECTION WITHOUT STOPPING UNTIL THE ENGINE QUIT! THIS FAILURE COULD RESULT IN A VERY TRAGIC ACCIDENT. I AND ESPECIALLY MY WIFE ARE VERY VERY CONCERNED WITH WHAT CAUSED THIS PROBLEM AND WE ARE AWAITING WORD FROM THE ACURA DEALER SPECIFIC TO WHAT THEY FOUND DURING THEIR INVESTIGATION.  MY WIFE DOES NOT WANT TO DRIVE THIS CAR IF THEY INDICATE THEY CAN NOT FIND OUT WHAT CAUSED THE CAR TO SUDDENLY ACCELERATE. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE DRIVING THIS CAR AND NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED ASAP SO NO ONE WILL SUFFER. WE WERE VERY LUCKY THIS TIME.</Summary></Complaint><Complaint xmlns=\"\"><ProductType>VEHICLE</ProductType><ModelYear>2012</ModelYear><Make>ACURA</Make><Model>RDX</Model><ODINumber>10671263</ODINumber><Manufacturer>Honda (American Honda Motor Co.)</Manufacturer><Crash>No</Crash><Fire>No</Fire><NumberOfInjured>0</NumberOfInjured><NumberOfDeaths>0</NumberOfDeaths><DateofIncident>2014-12-23T00:00:00</DateofIncident><DateComplaintFiled>2015-01-09T10:32:36</DateComplaintFiled><VIN>5J8TB1H28CA</VIN><Component>UNKNOWN OR OTHER</Component><Summary>DEC. 23 2014: MY HUSBAND AND I WERE TRAVELING DOWN HIGHWAY GA400 AT APPROX. 60 MPH. ALL WINDOWS WERE CLOSED, THE SUNROOF &amp; SUNROOF SHADE WERE CLOSED. APPROX. OUTSIDE TEMP WAS 45F, CLOUDY DAY, INSIDE VEHICLE TEMP WAS APPROX. 70F. THERE WERE NO CARS OR OBJECTS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE VEHICLE ON THE HIGHWAY. SUDDENLY, WE HEARD A LOUD POP THAT SEEMED TO COME FROM THE ROOF OF THE CAR.  SINCE WE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING MAKE CONTACT WITH THE ROOF OF THE CAR, WE DIDN'T INVESTIGATE FURTHER. JAN. 4, 2015: AGAIN TRAVELING ON THE HIGHWAY ABOUT 70MPH, WE HEARD A NOISE FROM THE SUNROOF. APPARENTLY PIECES OF GLASS FLYING OFF THE TOP OF THE ROOF.  AFTER, WE HEARD THE FAINT SOUND OF OUTSIDE AIR COMING FROM SUNROOF. THE PASSENGER OPENED THE SUNROOF SHADE JUST ENOUGH TO IMMEDIATELY SEE THAT THE ENTIRE SUNROOF GLASS WAS SHATTERED (PARTIALLY INTACT, BUT COMPLETELY SHATTERED). WITHIN THREE MINUTES WHEN A SAFE PLACE WAS REACHED, THE VEHICLE WAS PULLED OVER TO EXAMINE FROM OUTSIDE. DRIVER GOT OUT OF THE CAR, AND SAW THAT THE GLASS SUNROOF WAS BUCKLED UPWARDS (AS THOUGH IT HAD POPPED FROM THE INSIDE), WITH A HOLE IN THE CENTER APPROXIMATELY 6 INCHES IN DIAMETER. THE GLASS WAS NOT BROKEN IN ANY PATTERN WHICH INDICATED AN OBJECT FROM OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE HAD HIT IT. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE ROOF OF THE VEHICLE OF ANY INCIDENT. IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE GLASS HAD POPPED, POTENTIALLY DUE TO INCORRECT PRESSURE INSIDE THE VEHICLE, FROM THE INSIDE OUT.  THESE FACTORS LEAD US TO BELIEVE THE INCIDENT IS A VEHICLE SAFETY ISSUE, AT THE FAULT OF THE MANUFACTURER.  WE CONTACTED ACURA CORPORATE TO FILE A REPORT JAN 8, 2015.  </Summary></Complaint></Results></Response>",
