Rink, John This dissertation has four principal goals:&#13; 1. to provide Heinrich Schenker's theoretical notion of improvisation with an historical context, thus laying the groundwork for a Schenkerian study of Chopin's 'improvisatory' compositions;&#13; 2. by analysing most of his early pieces and several mature ones, to define Chopin's 'structural style', i.e\" the shared structural principles on which music from different genres was based; and by studying the evolution of his 'structural style' from 1817 to 1832, to show how Chopin developed the ability to conceive works as unified compositional statements rather than as a succession of independent sections;&#13; 3. to fill the gaps resulting from cursory treatment of Chopin's early and late music in the Schenkerian literature and in the work of other analysts; &#13; 4. to apply Schenkerian analytical techniques systematically to a wide body of repertoire in order to demonstrate the method's value as a musicological tool in defining the styles of other composers. &#13; &#13; The influence that improvisation had on Chopin's music has often been noted, but discussion has generally been confined to foreground details without regard to tonal structure, This study of Chopin's 'improvisatory' works - stile brillante repertoire, early dance pieces, F minor Fantasy and Polonaise-Fantasy - reveals that improvisatory practices were also important in the evolution of his 'structural style'. Contrary to Schenker's assumptions about 'genius', Chopin only gradually developed the 'improvisatory long-range vision' - that is, the ability to conceive works in a unifying 'sweep of improvisation' - that characterises his later music. Many early pieces seem to have been 'formally' conceived, with self-contained parts juxtaposed to create the whole. As he matured as a composer, Chopin learned to relate independent sections by means of structural voice-leading, tonal architecture, and an increasingly organic use of motivic and harmonic material.&#13; &#13; Overview of selected middle- and late-period works and detailed analysis of the Barcarolle and Polonaise-Fantasy show that structural principles established in Chopin's 'apprenticeship' remained a central feature of his mature 'structural style' despite the music's greater sophistication at the foreground level and the stylistic changes that occurred in the early 1840s. Chopin's reliance on these principles is particularly noteworthy in the Polonaise-Fantasy, which in the foreground conveys a sense of improvisatory freedom to the point of apparent disorder. </summary> <dc:date>1989-05-09T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> <entry> <title>Situational influences on rhythmicity in speech, music, and their interaction</title> <link href=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246071\" rel=\"alternate\"/> <author> <name>Hawkins, Sarah</name> </author> <id>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246071</id> <updated>2014-09-30T11:40:55Z</updated> <published>2014-01-01T00:00:00Z</published> <summary type=\"text\">Situational influences on rhythmicity in speech, music, and their interaction Hawkins, Sarah Brain processes underlying the production and perception of rhythm indicate considerable flexibility in how physical signals are interpreted. This paper explores how that flexibility might play out in rhythmicity in speech and music. There is much in common across the two domains, but there are also significant differences. Interpretations are explored that reconcile some of the differences, particularly with respect to how functional properties modify the rhythmicity of speech, within limits imposed by its structural constraints. Functional and structural differences mean that music is typically more rhythmic than speech, and that speech will be more rhythmic when the emotions are more strongly engaged, or intended to be engaged. The influence of rhythmicity on attention is acknowledged, and it is suggested that local increases in rhythmicity occur at times when attention is required to coordinate joint action, whether in talking or music-making. Evidence is presented that suggests that while these short phases of heightened rhythmical behaviour are crucial to the success of transitions in communicative interaction, their modality is immaterial: they all function to enhance precise temporal prediction and hence tightly-coordinated joint action.

However, the idea that music is a communicative medium has, to date, received little attention within the cognitive sciences, and the limited amount of research that addresses how and what music communicates has resulted in findings that appear to be of limited relevance to music therapy. This paper will draw on ethnomusicological evidence and an understanding of communication derived from the study of speech to sketch a framework within which to situate and understand music as communicative practice. It will outline some key features of music as an interactive participatory medium\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdincluding entrainment and floating intentionality\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdthat can help underpin an understanding of music as communicative, and that may help guide experimental approaches in the cognitive science of music to shed light on the processes involved in musical communication and on the consequences of engagement in communication through music for interacting individuals. It will suggest that the development of such approaches may enable the cognitive sciences to provide a more comprehensive, predictive understanding of music in interaction that could be of direct benefit to music therapy.

In addition to the individual mind/brain, the body, the social context, and musical instruments should be included in the analytical framework. In general, this means studying cognition and behaviour at settings that are as naturalistic as possible. Music and dance are ideal domains for studying these phenomena, as naturally social, embodied activities.&#13; &#13; Extending the traditional setting poses many challenges. I make the case for focusing the analysis on the interaction of multiple participants, instead of trying to measure the performance or mind-states of the individuals. This interactionist approach requires a specific set of analysis tools. For this purpose, I distinguish rhytmic synchronisation from entrainment between mutually cooperative individuals. I discuss a range of options from circular statistics to cross-recurrence analysis to various correlation-based analyses.&#13; &#13; Through a number of pilot studies, I developed a cooperative tapping setup for studying rhythmic entrainment in dyads. Using this setup, I compared human\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdhuman interaction to synchronising with a computer. Surprisingly, two human tappers reached better synchronicity than a human with a computer tapper, even though the human pairs drifted in tempo. This demonstrated the power of mutual adaptation.&#13; &#13; In a second series of experiments, motion capture was used to investigate the embodied nature of rhythmic entrainment. These cross-cultural studies on African dance, illustrated in more detail how synchronicity was achieved through a process of continuous, mutual adaptation. We observed interesting contrasts in how Finnish novices and South-African or Kenyan experts exhibited embodied metrical structures.&#13; &#13; As a conclusion, mutual adaptation is a powerful and ubiquitous phenomenon that can only be observed in real-time interactions. It is a good&#13; example of the kind of \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnew psychology\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd that can be uncovered by adopting a social, embodied, and dynamic approach to cognition. </summary> <dc:date>2014-03-04T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </entry> </feed> ",
