Anxiety was not associated with gender (&lt;em&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;= 0.07). Patients in the lowest and highest anxiety groups tended to be older (mean 54.5 and 44.4 years respectively) compared with those in the middle 2 groups (mean 34.1 and 35.6 years). There was an association between anxiety and age (&lt;em&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;= 0.039). 45 (32.0%) participants thought they were having a heart attack or dying. Before RFCA, median anxiety level was 7. 55 (39.0%) patients were afraid of complications, 21 (14.9%) patients feared being awake during RFCA. After RFCA, median anxiety was 2.5.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;: Anxiety is a common accompaniment to SVT that may lead to greater pre-procedural anxiety. Exploring this link may allow reduction of anxiety via better psychopharmacological intervention, education, and preprocedural counselling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Ahmed Yasser Mohamed El-Medany</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Neil Robert Grubb</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/776\">        <title>Sleep problems in cancer: effective psychological interventions \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd a systematic review</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/776</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction: &lt;/strong&gt;Sleep problems are one of the most prevalent complications cancer patients experience. These have been shown to produce harmful effects such as reduced immunity and mood disturbances. While pharmacological agents for sleep problems may be used, psychological therapies should be considered where possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: The aim of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of different psychological interventions for sleep problems in cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: A systematic review was conducted. Databases searched included PsychINFO, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science for papers published during the period from January 2003 to December 2013.

The main finding from this systematic review was that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is the most promising psychological intervention for the treatment of insomnia in cancer patients. Other psychological treatments such as sleep education and multimodal programmes also demonstrate good potential for use in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/strong&gt;Further randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of CBT and MBSR in different types of cancer are required to determine their relative benefits and costs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Hannah Elizabeth Venables</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/813\">        <title>Who needs a gut anyway?</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/813</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;This is an up-to-date review on Chronic Intestinal Failure (CIF) and Parenteral Nutrition (PN) as a management strategy for CIF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CIF and long-term PN are important subjects, but are superficially covered in undergraduate curricula due to the perception that they are relatively specialist areas. PN, as well as being a form of acute nutritional support, is used as a life-sustaining measure for patients with CIF due to conditions such as bowel ischaemia and Crohn\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds disease. Currently, around 500 patients receive long-term PN in the UK and the numbers are expected to rise with the aging population&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a costly service, requiring a multidisciplinary team effort, along with high frequency patient-healthcare interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article aims to discuss the current evidence on the causes, management and prognosis of CIF, with a particular focus on PN as a form of nutritional management. While PN seems to improve the prognosis of patients with CIF from a medical point of view, we will also explore how it affects other aspects of a patient\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds life, such as their social life and mental health.\\ufffd\\ufffd&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Esther Ha Gyeong Park</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Stuart J Fergusson</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Connor Johnston</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Hani Syaza Syahirah Zakaria</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Jay Roe Tan</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Matthew Wood</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Xavier Kai Yang Tay</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/811\">        <title>The New Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Agents And Their Role in Acute Coronary Syndrome</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/811</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Prasugrel and ticagrelor are two novel antiplatelet agents, which have been subject to large randomized trials to compare their efficacy with clopidogrel for patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim:&lt;/strong&gt; To conduct a systematic review of prasugrel and ticagrelor as alternative therapy to clopidogrel in patients who present with ACS undergoing PCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods: &lt;/strong&gt;The articles cited in this paper were searched on PubMed, MEDLINE, and Plymouth University\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Metalib database. The search terms used included \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffddual antiplatelet therapy\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdprasugrel\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdticagrelor\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdclopidogrel resistance\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion: &lt;/strong&gt;The main indications for the use of prasugrel based on current understanding are patients presenting with acute STEMI referred for primary PCI, ACS patients with DM, or those who have a high risk of stent thrombosis. Ticagrelor, on the other hand, may provide optimal benefit for patients with NSTEMI treated with conservative or invasive therapy, those with previous TIA or stroke, advanced age, or small body surface. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: &lt;/strong&gt;Prasugrel and ticagrelor have been shown to be adequate P2Y&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; antiplatelet therapy alternatives to clopidogrel in the management of patients with ACS. While prasugrel and ticagrelor have both been shown to clinically improve platelet inhibition and significantly reduce the incidence of stent thrombosis compared with clopidogrel therapy, both increase the risk of a significant bleeding incident. Both ticagrelor and prasugrel have been shown to be appropriate and effective treatment alternatives for ACS patients who display clopidogrel treatment resistance or failure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Gareth John Williams</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/763\">        <title>A review on the use of aspirin as a form of chemoprevention to reduce colorectal cancer</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/763</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer worldwide. Estimated lifetime risk of CRC is 5%, with an incidence of 1 million new cases and 600\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd000 deaths worldwideevery year. Lifestyle, dietary, and genetic factors play a crucial part in the development of colorectal cancer. Chemoprevention is a method of CRC prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim&lt;/strong&gt;: This review aims to identify the effectiveness of aspirin in preventing CRC in high-, moderate- and low-risk patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method&lt;/strong&gt;: Electronic databases were used to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from 1989 to 2012 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials.

Higher doses of aspirin appear to reduce the incidence of CRC.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It is unclear what the optimum dose to start is, and the duration of administration that will provide effective chemoprevention. Further research is needed to answer these questions.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Sadiq Shanaz</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/743\">        <title>An Estimate of Lyme Borreliosis Incidence in Western Europe</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/743</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks in the USA and Europe. This review aims to estimate the regional burden of LB in Western Europe. Data from previous publications were used to calculate the mean incidence. The mean incidence rates were then combined to estimate the regional burden and a population-weighted regional burden of disease based on the standardized incidence from the included studies and the total population at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Reviews and surveillance reports identified by the initial database search were first assessed for eligibility by their title and abstract, and subsequently by a more detailed review of the source for the most recent data regarding LB. 11 sources of incidence data were included in the review, representing 17 countries in total. Incidence estimates were calculated from reported values and population data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Countries in Western Europe have a large variance in the incidence rates. The highest reported incidences for LB were reported in southern Sweden with 464 per 100\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd000 and the lowest in Italy of 0.001 per 100\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd000. The unweighted mean for the included data provided an incidence of 56.3 per 100\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd000 persons per year, equating to approximately 232\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd125 cases in one year throughout the region. The calculated population-weighted average incidence for the regional burden of LB in Western Europe was 22.05 cases per 100\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd000 person-years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: LB is an emerging disease and the most common zoonotic infection in Western Europe approaching endemic proportions in many European countries. The population-weighted incidence has been estimated by this study to be 22.04 per 100\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd000 person-years. Concordant and well-conducted surveillance and disease awareness should continue to be encouraged to monitor LB as tick numbers and activity increases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Robert Alexander Sykes</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/732\">        <title>Interstitial Lung Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Clinical Dilemma</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/732</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdassociated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is an increasingly common extra-articular cause of mortality and morbidity in RA. Here, we present the case of an 82-year-old female suffering from RA-ILD.

Moreover, she had been on long-term methotrexate, which can cause pulmonary disease. Investigations revealed raised inflammatory markers, restrictive lung patterns, and radiological features of ILD. She was treated with a tapering course of oral prednisolone and home oxygen, which provided some symptomatic improvement.

Recent guidelines published by the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR), have provided clinicians with a framework for achieving these aims. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aims&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: To evaluate the management of gout in a primary care centre in North West England against recognized standards. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;:\\ufffd\\ufffdAn electronic search on EMIS Web using the Read codes \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgout\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd and \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdgouty arthritis\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd, with a specified period of 2010\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd2013, generated a cohort of patients who were categorized into 2 groups: those prescribed urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol) and those not. Patients on febuxostat were excluded. Clinical data from the patients were extracted and retrospectively audited. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: A total of 112 patients were identified, of which only 46% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 52) of patients were reviewed after an acute attack. Among those who were prescribed allopurinol, only 19% (&lt;em&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 12) achieved target serum urate levels while only 67% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 42) had their serum urate levels checked regularly and 31% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 20) had dosage adjustments. Comparatively, in patients not prescribed allopurinol, a few indications for initiating allopurinol were detected: 29% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 12) had more than one attack of gout in a year, 27% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 11) suffered from renal insufficiency, 2% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1) presented with tophi, and 17% (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7) were on diuretics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;: Gout management in this primary care centre is not fully concordant to the BSR guidelines.

It is a challenging condition to diagnose and manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aim:&lt;/strong&gt; The CF team at Alder Hey Children\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds Hospital aimed to assess how consistently and effectively they were managing the condition. A diagnosis and management monitoring tool was used to systematically draw data for auditing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Out of 87 patients under the care of the CF team, 20 had previously been diagnosed with ABPA. 60% had 4 out of the 4 minimal diagnostic criteria. 75% grew cultures positive for &lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus &lt;/em&gt;at some point since their diagnosis of ABPA. All patients had received prednisolone therapy at some point since diagnosis, with 7 patients receiving the maximum starting dose of 40\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmg and 1.29\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdmg/kg for those below maximum dose. 14 patients were prescribed antifungal therapy. 5 patients had levels ordered when they started the therapy, 5 had levels ordered between 45 and 1149 days after prescription, and 3 have had no levels ordered to date. A second audit was performed one year later to complete the audit cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: This cohort of patients had a much higher prevalence of ABPA than the general CF population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;WordSection2&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;: Research into the relationship between ABPA exacerbation and concurrent infections or antibiotic therapy could help identify risk factors for developing an exacerbation. There should be discussions about how to improve the consistency in initial dosing of prednisolone, considering guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: There should be more itraconazole levels taken to ensure safety and effectiveness of antifungal therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot; /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Hannah Elizabeth Beresford</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Eleanor Hunter</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>    <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/812\">        <title>Audit into the Appropriateness of CT Cervical Spine Scan Requesting in the Emergency Department</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/812</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;:\\ufffd\\ufffd The use of computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cervical spine (CS) is now the recommended primary screening modality for suspected CS injuries following trauma. The aim of this audit is to review the appropriate use of CS CT imaging in the emergency department (ED) and assess compliance with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) head injury clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Charts were reviewed for the last 50 trauma patients to receive a CS CT scan following a request from the ED at University Hospital Limerick between 10 July 2013 and 19 December 2013. The NICE clinical guideline 176 on head injury was used as the standard of care. These data were used to perform a retrospective audit to assess patients who satisfied NICE criteria to qualify for a CS CT scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: 45 patients who had undergone a CS CT scan were identified, this group had a mean age of 42 years and 71% of them were male. At least one of the NICE guideline criteria was fulfilled in 100% of patients who had a CS CT, with 2.64 of the criteria fulfilled on average. Plain-film X-ray radiography (PF) was inadequate for diagnosis in 20 (44.4%) patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;: ED consultants appropriately refer patients for CS CT scans following CS trauma and adhere to NICE head injury clinical guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: Having guidelines in place in the ED and adopting CS CT imaging as an initial screening modality following CS injury may reduce time to definitive care and improve resource implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Marc Adam Jacobson</dc:creator>        <dc:creator>Damien Ryan</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/746\">        <title>Schizophrenia - From Devilry to Disease</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/746</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of psychotic diseases historically instilled fear and distrust in onlookers, who associated them with witchcraft, demonic spirits, and the devil. From Egyptian medicine to medieval witch hunts, psychotic diseases have been associated with the supernatural throughout history. Yet even with advancements in neuroscience and improvements in our understanding of mental illness, stigma surrounding mental health remains prevalent today. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric illness which has evaded a clinical definition until relatively recently; even now, the precise features that constitute a schizophrenic patient are open to dispute. This article explores the ancient history of mental health with a particular emphasis on psychosis, and also considers the changing attitudes and understanding of schizophrenia throughout the last century, leading to its clinical definition as a treatable condition.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>            <dc:creator>Ruaridh Owen</dc:creator>            <dc:date>2014-11-29</dc:date>     <prism:publicationDate>2014-11-29</prism:publicationDate>       <prism:volume>22</prism:volume>   </item>     <item rdf:about=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/1122\">        <title>Why should medical students be concerned about global governance?</title>    <link>http://journals.ed.ac.uk/resmedica/article/view/1122</link>            <description>&lt;p&gt;This article introduces the work of the Lancet-University of Oslo Commission on Global&lt;br /&gt;Governance for Health and its parallel Youth Commission, which published their reports in&lt;br /&gt;2014. Because the role of socioeconomic conditions in the production of health outcomes and\\ufffd\\ufffdhealth inequities has already long been recognized, the Commission further examined the\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdpolitical determinants of health,\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd particularly the systemic dysfunctions of global governance,\\ufffd\\ufffdespecially in areas that are deemed as \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnon-health\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd such as trade, finance, agriculture, migration,\\ufffd\\ufffdand security. To support the Commission\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffds thesis, the Youth Commission then proposed the\\ufffd\\ufffdadoption of the \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdcapability approach\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd as a guiding framework of global governance for health.\\ufffd\\ufffdFirst introduced by Amartya Sen, this approach emphasizes on the need for equality in the space\\ufffd\\ufffdof capabilities or freedoms needed to achieve various things that people value. Nevertheless,\\ufffd\\ufffdwhile the road toward better global governance remains elusive, the next generation of leaders,\\ufffd\\ufffdincluding medical students, can already be prepared to tackle these seemingly insurmountable\\ufffd\\ufffdchallenges. Various ways by which medical students can learn and understand global governance\\ufffd\\ufffdand global health include incorporation into the medical curriculum, internships, and\\ufffd\\ufffdinvolvement in student organizations with global health orientation.
