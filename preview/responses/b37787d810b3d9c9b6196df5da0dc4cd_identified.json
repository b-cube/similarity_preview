Respondents were asked to give their opinions of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his policies and to comment on whether their quality of life had changed since Giuliani took office in January 1994. Those queried were asked for whom they would vote, given Republican candidate Giuliani and possible Democratic candidates Fernando Ferrer, Ruth Messinger, Al Sharpton, and Sal Albanese. Respondents were asked which of the following problems presented the greatest challenge to the city of New York: crime, the job market, the economy, race relations, education, poverty, housing, or changes in the welfare system. An additional question addressed the 1993 New York City mayoral election between Republican candidate Giuliani and Democratic candidate David Dinkins. Background information on respondents includes age, race, ethnicity, sex, education, political party, political orientation, religion, voter registration and participation history, and family income.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                    <timePrd event=\"single\" date=\"1997\" cycle=\"P1\">1997</timePrd>                                         <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>New York (state)</geogCover>             <geogCover>New York City</geogCover>             <geogCover>United States</geogCover>                                            </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>                    </dataColl>       <notes>                 This collection has not been processed by ICPSR staff.
