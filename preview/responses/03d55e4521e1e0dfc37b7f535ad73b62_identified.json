(b) Indian River south Sebastian Inlet: OK (c) Indian River Lagoon - Fort Pierce inlet: OK (d) Indian River Lagoon - St. Lucie Inlet: I included the ICW in the shapefile, and created one solid polygon. I also redigitized the eastern side along the shoreline using Bing Maps as a background in ArcMap. (e) Hobe Sound: The coordinate in the FR is suppose to be at SR 708, but looking at Bing Maps, it is to the south. I edited the shapefile to continue north to SR 708. I also made one big poly that does not depict the ICW exclusion. The polygon shorelines were also edited to follow the Bing Maps background. (f) Jupiter Inlet: I digitized a boundary that followed the shoreline (again, employing heads-up digitizing techniques using Bing Maps). (g) Lake Worth: the original shapefile had a 4 vertice polygon that approximated the shoreline on the south side. I digitized the shoreline along the south side using Bing Maps as a guide. (h) Lake Worth Lagoon - Boynton Inlet: I edited the polygon to go all the way to the coordinates (the shape file does not exclude the ICW). I also redigitized the western edge to follow the Bing Maps shoreline. (i) Lake Wyman: The original shapefile excluded the ICW, so I redigitized the polygon to extend to the published coordinates. This unit did not follow the shoreline on the eastern side, so I redigitized it to follow the Bing Maps shoreline. (j) A portion of Northern Biscayne Bay, FL: I received a new Biscayne Bay Aquatic Preserve boundary from Florida DEP, Bureau of Survey and Mapping, Division of State Lands (rev. 2010). The boundary is from Section 258.39 (11) Florida Statutes, and Section 258.397. They send me the exterior boundary for the AP. They said that the law for the boundary has not changed, but the boundary is more accurate now. If there are questions about specific sites within the boundary, contact the Title and Land Records Section of the Bureau of Survey and Mapping Division of State Lands (850)245-2788.</procdesc>         <proccont>           <cntinfo>             <cntorgp>               <cntorg>NOAA/NMFS Southeast Regional Office</cntorg>               <cntper>Amanda Frick</cntper>             </cntorgp>             <cntpos>GIS Coordinator</cntpos>             <cntaddr>               <addrtype>mailing and physical</addrtype>               <address>263 13th Ave South</address>               <city>St. Petersburg</city>               <state>FL</state>               <postal>33701</postal>               <country>US</country>             </cntaddr>             <cntvoice>727-824-5312</cntvoice>             <cntfax>727-824-5309</cntfax>             <cntemail>amanda.frick@noaa.gov</cntemail>             <hours>9:00am-5:30pm M-F</hours>           </cntinfo>         </proccont>       </procstep>       <procstep>         <procdesc>A point layer was created using the coordinates in the Federal Register. Those points were then used to digitize polygons. The polygons were then \"clipped\" to a detailed shoreline (cb24_det.e00) obtained from St. John's River Water Management District (SJRWMD). Following the clip operation, microstation design files of the ICW and Miami Harbor navigation channels were obtained from the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and converted to shapefiles. The final ICW shapefile was created by using a 62.5ft buffer on either side of the centerline and editing that buffer file to match the widening areas in the vicinity of the critical habitat areas. The final Miami Harbor shapefile was created by digitizing a polygon over the channel edge line work in the design file. An Edit Clip was then performed to \"punch a hole\" through the Critical Habitat areas where they intersected the ICW and the Miami Harbor navigation channel, thus excluding the federally authorized navigation channels from the Critical Habitat areas. Finally, the data in the vicinity of Miami Harbor in Biscayne Bay were edited visually to correspond to the paper maps in the federal register document. Additionally, all data used were reprojected to match the detailed shoreline.
