The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 1985 - 2010-Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era.  These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time.  This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.</abstract>       <purpose>C-CAP is dedicated to the development, distribution, and application of land cover and change data for the coastal regions of the U.S. This effort is being conducted in close coordination with state coastal management agencies, the interagency Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 effort.</purpose>       <supplinf>Attributes for this product are as follows: 0 Background 1 Unclassified (Cloud, Shadow, etc) 2 High Intensity Developed 3 Medium Intensity Developed 4 Low Intensity Developed 5 Developed Open Space 6 Cultivated Land 7 Pasture/Hay 8 Grassland 9 Deciduous Forest 10 Evergreen Forest 11 Mixed Forest 12 Scrub/Shrub 13 Palustrine Forested Wetland 14 Palustrine Scrub/Shrub Wetland 15 Palustrine Emergent Wetland 16 Estuarine Forested Wetland 17 Estuarine Scrub/Shrub Wetland 18 Estuarine Emergent Wetland 19 Unconsolidated Shore 20 Bare Land 21 Open Water 22 Palustrine Aquatic Bed 23 Estuarine Aquatic Bed 24 Tundra 25 Snow/Ice</supplinf>     </descript>     <timeperd>       <timeinfo>         <rngdates>           <begdate>1985</begdate>           <enddate>2011</enddate>         </rngdates>       </timeinfo>       <current>Date of Landsat Scenes</current>     </timeperd>     <status>       <progress>In work</progress>       <update>5 years, or as needed</update>     </status>     <spdom>       <bounding>         <westbc>-129.64</westbc>         <eastbc>-66.01</eastbc>         <northbc>51.07</northbc>         <southbc>22.60</southbc>       </bounding>     </spdom>     <keywords>       <theme>         <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Category</themekt>         <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>NGDA Portfolio Themes</themekt>         <themekey>NGDA</themekey>         <themekey>National Geospatial Data Asset</themekey>         <themekey>Land Use Land Cover Theme</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>None</themekt>         <themekey>Remotely Sensed Imagery/Photos</themekey>         <themekey>Land Cover Analysis</themekey>         <themekey>CCAP</themekey>         <themekey>Coastal Change Analysis Program</themekey>       </theme>       <theme>         <themekt>NASA/GCMD Earth Science Keywords</themekt>         <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE : Land Surface : Land Use/Land Cover : Land Cover</themekey>         <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE : Land Surface : Land Use/Land Cover : Land Use Classes</themekey>         <themekey>EARTH SCIENCE : Human Dimensions : Environmental Governance/Management : Land Management : Land Use/Land Cover Classification</themekey>       </theme>       <place>         <placekt>None</placekt>         <placekey>U.S.</placekey>         <placekey>Maine</placekey>         <placekey>New Hampshire</placekey>         <placekey>Vermont</placekey>         <placekey>Massachusetts</placekey>         <placekey>Connecticut</placekey>         <placekey>Rhode Island</placekey>         <placekey>New York</placekey>         <placekey>New Jersey</placekey>         <placekey>Delaware</placekey>         <placekey>Maryland</placekey>         <placekey>Virginia</placekey>         <placekey>Pennsylvania</placekey>         <placekey>Ohio</placekey>         <placekey>Indiana</placekey>         <placekey>Illinois</placekey>         <placekey>Michigan</placekey>         <placekey>Wisconsin</placekey>         <placekey>Minnesota</placekey>         <placekey>North Carolina</placekey>         <placekey>South Carolina</placekey>         <placekey>Georgia</placekey>         <placekey>Florida</placekey>         <placekey>Alabama</placekey>         <placekey>Mississippi</placekey>         <placekey>Louisiana</placekey>         <placekey>Texas</placekey>         <placekey>California</placekey>         <placekey>Oregon</placekey>         <placekey>Washington</placekey>         <placekey>U.S. Coastal Zone</placekey>       </place>     </keywords>     <accconst>None</accconst>     <useconst>Data set is not for use in litigation.
