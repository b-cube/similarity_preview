This particular survey was concerned with the attitudes and opinions of the citizens of South Africa. Respondents in a face-to-face interview were asked to rate South Africa's President Thabo Mbeki and his administration's overall performance, to state the most important issues facing the nation, and to evaluate the effectiveness of certain continental and international institutions. Opinions were gathered on the role of the government in improving the economy, whether corruption existed in local and national government, whether government officials were responsive to problems of the general population, and whether local government officials, the police, the courts, the overall criminal justice system, the media, the National Electoral Commission, and the government broadcasting service could be trusted. Respondents were polled on their knowledge of government officials, their level of personal involvement in political, governmental, and community affairs, their participation in national elections, the inclusiveness of the government, and the identification of causes of conflict and resources that may aid in the resolution of conflict. Economic questions addressed the past, present, and future of the country's and the respondent's economic condition, and whether great income disparities are fair. Societal questions were asked of respondents concerning the meaning of being \"poor\" and \"rich,\" monetary support systems, personal responsibility for success or failure, characteristics used in self-identification, methods for securing food, water, schooling, medical services, news and information, and ease of obtaining assistance for certain services. Background variables include age, gender, ethnicity, education, religious affiliation and participation, political party affiliation, language spoken most at home, whether the respondent was head of household, current and past employment status, whether a close friend or relative had died from AIDS, language used in interview, and type of physical disability, if any. In addition, demographic information pertaining to the interviewer is provided, as well as their response to the interview, observations of the respondent's attitude during the interview and of the interview environment.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"2006-02-06\" cycle=\"P1\">2006-02-06</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"2006-02-28\" cycle=\"P1\">2006-02-28</timePrd>                                                       <collDate event=\"start\" date=\"2006-02-06\" cycle=\"P1\">2006-02-06</collDate>         <collDate event=\"end\" date=\"2006-02-28\" cycle=\"P1\">2006-02-28</collDate>                            <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Africa</geogCover>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>             <geogCover>South Africa</geogCover>             <geogCover>Sub-Saharan Africa</geogCover>                   <geogUnit>county</geogUnit>                   <anlyUnit>individual</anlyUnit>                     <universe>All adult citizens of South Africa.</universe>                      <dataKind>survey data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    The sample is designed as a representative cross-section of all citizens of voting age in a given country. The goal is to give every adult citizen an equal and known chance of selection for interview. This objective was reached by (a) strictly applying random selection methods at every stage of sampling and by (b) applying sampling with probability proportionate to population size wherever possible. A randomly selected sample of 1,200 cases allows inferences to national adult populations with a margin of sampling error of no more than plus or minus 2.5 percent with a confidence level of 95 percent. If the sample size is increased to 2,400, the confidence interval shrinks to plus or minus 2 percent. For more information in regard to sampling, please refer to the \"Sampling\" section of the ICPSR codebook.          </sampProc>                                      <collMode>face-to-face interview</collMode>                               <weight>               Weighting variable, WITHINWT, adjusts the distribution of the sample based on individual selection probabilities (i.e., based on province, gender, urban-rural distribution, and size of household and enumeration area). Please refer to the codebook for more information on weighting.     </weight>        <cleanOps><p>ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of   disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major   statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data.
