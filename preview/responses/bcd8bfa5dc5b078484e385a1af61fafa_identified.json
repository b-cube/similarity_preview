Involution is a process whereby the mammary gland undergoes extensive tissue&#13; remodelling involving exquisitely coordinated cell death, extracellular matrix&#13; degradation and adipose tissue regeneration following the weaning of offspring. These&#13; processes are mediated in part through Jak/Stat signalling pathways, which can be&#13; deregulated in breast cancer. Synthetic in vitro analogues of the breast could become&#13; important tools for studying tumorigenic processes, or as personalized drug discovery&#13; platforms and predictors of therapeutic response. Ideally, such models should support&#13; 3D neo-tissue formation, so as to recapitulate physiological organ function, and be&#13; compatible with high-throughput screening methodologies. We have combined cell lines&#13; of epithelial, stromal and immunological origin within porous engineered collagen&#13; matrices, demonstrating 3D specific molecular signatures. Furthermore seeded cells&#13; form mammary-like branched tissues, with lobuloaveolar structures that undergo&#13; inducible involution phenotypes reminiscent of the native gland under&#13; hormonal/cytokine regulation. We confirm that autophagy is mediated within&#13; differentiated mammary epithelial cells in a Stat-dependent manner at early time points&#13; following the removal of a prolactin stimulus (H/WD). In addition, epithelial cells&#13; express markers of an M2 macrophage lineage under H/WD, a process that is&#13; attenuated with the introduction of the monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW 264.7.&#13; Thus, such 3D models are suitable platforms for studying cell-cell interactions and cell&#13; death mechanisms in relation to cancer.

This thesis addresses transmission electron microscope characterisation of nanoparticle morphology, concerning specifically the crystal- lographic status of novel intermetallic GaPd2 nanocatalysts and advancement of electron tomographic methods for high-fidelity three-dimensional analysis.&#13; &#13; Going beyond preceding analyses, high-resolution annular dark-field imaging is used to verify successful nano-sizing of the intermetallic compound GaPd2. It also reveals catalytically significant and crystallographically intriguing deviations from the bulk crystal structure. So-called \\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnon-crystallographic\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd five-fold twinned nanoparticles are observed, adding a new perspective in the long standing debate over how such morphologies may be achieved.&#13; &#13; The morphological complexity of the GaPd2 nanocatalysts, and many cognate nanoparticle systems, demands fully three-dimensional analysis. It is illustrated how image processing techniques applied to electron tomography reconstructions can facilitate more facile and objective quantitative analysis (\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffdnano-metrology\\ufffd\\ufffd\\ufffd). However, the fidelity of the analysis is limited ultimately by artefacts in the tomographic reconstruction.&#13; &#13; Compressed sensing, a new sampling theory, asserts that many signals can be recovered from far fewer measurements than traditional theories dictate are necessary. Compressed sensing is applied here to electron tomographic reconstruction, and is shown to yield far higher fidelity reconstructions than conventional algorithms. Reconstruction from extremely limited data, more robust quantitative analysis and novel three-dimensional imaging are demon- strated, including the first three-dimensional imaging of localised surface plasmon resonances. Many aspects of transmission electron microscopy characterisation may be enhanced using a compressed sensing approach. </description> <dc:date>2015-02-03T00:00:00Z</dc:date> </item> <item rdf:about=\"http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246864\"> <title>Hall effect and transmission electron microscopy of epitaxial MnSi thin films</title> <link>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk:80/handle/1810/246864</link> <description>Hall effect and transmission electron microscopy of epitaxial MnSi thin films Meynell, S. A.; Wilson, M. N.; Loudon, J. C.; Spitzig, A.; Rybakov, F. N.; Johnson, M. B.; Monchesky, T. L. We present Hall effect measurements on MnSi/Si(111) epilayers and find an anomalous Hall contribution that is significantly smaller than in bulk crystals, which enables the observation of an additional contribution to the anomalous signal previously overlooked in MnSi. Our measurements indicate the signal is not due to skyrmions in MnSi thin films, which are absent in out-of-plane fields, but rather are the result of scattering from the cone phase. The absence of magnetic contrast in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements are consistent with this interpretation. We provide a method to model TEM images of skyrmions lattices to determine the conditions necessary for their observation in other B20 epilayers with an anisotropy that is favourable to their formation.

W.; Dhesi, Sarnjeet S.; Mathur, Neil D. High-resolution magnetoelectric imaging is used to demonstrate electrical control of the perpendicular local magnetization associated with 125 nm-wide magnetic stripe domains in 100-nm-thick Ni films. This magnetoelectric coupling is achieved in zero magnetic field using strain from ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrates to control perpendicular anisotropy imposed by the growth stress. These findings may be exploited for perpendicular recording in nanopatterned hybrid media. This is the final published version.
