CARPET (Center And Research Program in Engineered Tufts) is an endowed program established by the carpet and allied industries to support research related to the floorcoverings sector. It provides a link between academic institutions and the carpet industry to address both technical and educational issues. Fundamental research laboratories will be located at GIT in Atlanta, and pilot processing/testing laboratories are being set up at the DSC Dalton site. CARPET's missions as related to the sustainability of the carpet industry and products will be discussed. </description> <dc:date>2002-05-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Cook, Fred L.</dc:creator> <dc:description>CARPET (Center And Research Program in Engineered Tufts) is an endowed program established by the carpet and allied industries to support research related to the floorcoverings sector.

Cement kilns have a tremendous appetite for energy. Carpet has a relatively high value of energy content due to its high fraction of polymer material, and its calcium carbonate filler is a feed for cement kilns. This talk will focus on the progress that has been made towards solving the technical and economic issues surrounding the use of carpet as fuel for cement kilns as part of a regional system for recycling carpet. </description> <dc:date>2002-05-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Realff, Matthew J.</dc:creator> <dc:creator>Clark, James L.</dc:creator> <dc:creator>Cook, Fred L.</dc:creator> <dc:description>Cement kilns have a tremendous appetite for energy.

All three forms offer several major advantages over wood products (including waterproof, bug-proof, and high strength), and can be made by placing a single additional machine at the end of a needle-punch line. </description> <dc:date>2002-05-13T00:00:00Z</dc:date> <dc:creator>Bacon, Forrest</dc:creator> <dc:creator>Holland, Wendell</dc:creator> <dc:creator>Weitz, Jack</dc:creator> <dc:creator>Kelly, Patrick</dc:creator> <dc:description>Three new categories of building materials are discussed, all made from needle-punched mats obtained from shredded carpet: (1) \"Nyloprime\" is made with a two-component adhesive mixture that undergoes foaming reaction to drive the liquid through the dense fiber mat; this material can create a wood-like material in sheets, comparable to plywood or oriented strand board; (2) \"Nyloflex\" uses heat to soften low-melt polymers such as polypropylene, into a leather-like material; and (3) \"Nyloplate\" uses resins or heated compression of Nyloboard, to create a harder material that approaches a ceramic in its traits.
