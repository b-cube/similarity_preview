Photosynthetic microbes exhibit light-dependent electron export across the cell membrane,&#13; which can generate electricity in biological photovoltaic (BPV) devices. How electrons are&#13; exported remains to be determined; the identification of mechanisms would help selection or&#13; generation of photosynthetic microbes capable of enhanced electrical output. We show that&#13; plasma membrane NADPH oxidase activity is a significant component of light-dependent&#13; generation of electricity by the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. NADPH&#13; oxidases export electrons across the plasma membrane to form superoxide anion from oxygen.&#13; The C. reinhardtii mutant lacking the NADPH oxidase encoded by RBO1 is impaired in both&#13; extracellular superoxide anion production and current generation in a BPV device. Complementation&#13; with the wild-type gene restores both capacities, demonstrating the role of the&#13; enzyme in electron export. Monitoring light-dependent extracellular superoxide production with&#13; a colorimetric assay is shown to be an effective way of screening for electrogenic potential of&#13; candidate algal strains. The results show that algal NADPH oxidases are important for superoxide&#13; anion production and open avenues for optimizing the biological component of these devices.

M. F.; van Heck, Ruben; Lam, Carolyn M. C.; Scaife, Mark A.; Martins dos Santos, Vitor A. P.; Smith, Alison G.; Schaap, Peter J. Many species of microalgae possess the capacity to produce hydrocarbons, polysaccharides,&#13; and other valuable products in significant amounts. However, large-scale production of algal&#13; products is not yet competitive against non-renewable alternatives from fossil fuel. Metabolic&#13; engineering approaches will help improve productivity, but the exact metabolic pathways and&#13; identity of the majority of the genes involved remain unknown. Recent advances in&#13; bioinformatics and systems biology modeling coupled with increasing numbers of algal&#13; genome sequencing projects are providing the means to address this. A multi-disciplinary&#13; integration of methods will provide synergy for a systems-level understanding of microalgae,&#13; and thereby speed up the improvement of industrially valuable strains. In this review we&#13; highlight recent advances, challenges, their application in microalgae research, and potentials. This is the accepted manuscript.

Biofuels vary in their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when displacing fossil fuels. Savings depend primarily on the crop used for biofuel production, and on the effect that expanding its cultivation has on land use. Evidence-based policies should be used to ensure that maximal sustainability benefits result from the development of biofuels. This is the accepted manuscript.

In Nature, no species live in isolation. Traditionally, efforts to grow organisms for use in biotechnology have focused on a single-species approach, particularly where a high-value product is required in pure form. In such scenarios, preventing the establishment of contaminants requires considerable effort that is justified economically. However, for algal biotechnology, in particular where the focus is on fuel production, axenic culture is not necessary, provided yields of the desired strain are not hampered by unwanted contaminants. In the following article we review what is known about inter-specific interactions of natural algal communities, the dynamics of which are likely to parallel contamination in industrial systems. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities to improve both yields and the stability of cultures by growing algae in multi-species consortia. This is the accepted manuscript.
