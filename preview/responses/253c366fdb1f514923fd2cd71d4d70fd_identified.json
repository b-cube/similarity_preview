TIGER, TIGER/Line, and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the Bureau of the Census. The 1998 TIGER/Line files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the Census TIGER data base. The geographic coverage for a single TIGER/Line file is a county or statistical equivalent entity, with the coverage area based on January 1, 1999 legal boundaries. A complete set of 1999 TIGER/Line files includes all counties and statistically equivalent entities in the United States, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, U.S. Minor Outlying Areas, and the Pacific Island Areas. The Census TIGER data base represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each county-based TIGER/Line file is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the files can be combined to cover the whole Nation and its territories. The 1999 TIGER/Line files consist of line segments representing physical features and governmental and statistical boundaries. The files contain information distributed over a series of record types for the spatial objects of a county. There are 17 record types, including the basic data record, the shape coordinate points, and geographic codes that can be used with appropriate software to prepare maps. Other geographic information contained in the files includes tributes such as feature identifiers/census feature class codes (CFCC) used to differentiate feature types, address ranges and ZIP Codes, codes for legal and statistical entities, latitude/longitude coordinates of linear and point features, landmark point features, area landmarks, key geographic features, and area boundaries. The 1999 TIGER/Line data dictionary contains a complete list of all the fields in the 17 record types.The subject file represents Census Tracts 2000 for the State of Arkansas.</dct:description>         <dcat:keyword>society</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>census</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>demographic</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>tract</dcat:keyword>         <dcat:keyword>population</dcat:keyword>     <foaf:homepage rdf:resource=\"https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/census-tract-2000-polygon\"></foaf:homepage>     <rdfs:label>census-tract-2000-polygon</rdfs:label>     <dct:identifier>census-tract-2000-polygon</dct:identifier>     <dct:title>Census Tract 2000 (polygon)</dct:title>         <dcat:distribution>             <dcat:Distribution>                 <dcat:accessURL rdf:resource=\"http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov/G6/Home.html?id=b4bc31c05220a60e51bc0f53b38af2f1\"></dcat:accessURL>                <dct:title>Web Page</dct:title>             </dcat:Distribution>         </dcat:distribution>         <dcat:distribution>             <dcat:Distribution>                 <dcat:accessURL rdf:resource=\"http://www.geostor.arkansas.gov\"></dcat:accessURL>                <dct:title>Web Page</dct:title>             </dcat:Distribution>         </dcat:distribution>         <dct:relation>           <rdf:Description>             <rdfs:label>responsible-party</rdfs:label>             <rdf:value>[{\"name\": \"U.
