The model seeks to demonstrate that electoral reform and export growth and diversification during the 1830s and the early 1840s, both independently and through their influence on the party affiliation of M.P.s, raised the political cost to M.P.s of maintaining a protectionist policy, thereby contributing to the policy shift from protectionism to free trade. The data include constituency characteristics derived from death duty registers and income tax returns.         </abstract>                           <sumDscr>                                <timePrd event=\"start\" date=\"1832\" cycle=\"P1\">1832</timePrd>         <timePrd event=\"end\" date=\"1846\" cycle=\"P1\">1846</timePrd>                                        <nation>Please see geographic coverage.</nation>             <geogCover>Global</geogCover>             <geogCover>Great Britain</geogCover>                                 <universe>All borough and county constituencies in Britain.</universe>                      <dataKind>aggregate data</dataKind>                   </sumDscr>        </stdyInfo>        <method>            <dataColl>               <sampProc>                    Systematic random sampling.          </sampProc>                  <sources>          <dataSrc>                          (1) British death duty registers for 1830 and 1850, (2)   Income tax returns for 1814 and 1856, (3) Philbin, J.H.
